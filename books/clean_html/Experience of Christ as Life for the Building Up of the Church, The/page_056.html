<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ANOINTING FOR TRANSFORMATION</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:21-22; 3:3, 6, 8, 17-18</H1><P>Thus far, we have seen that there are four lines in both 1 and 2 Corinthians. The four lines in 1 Corinthians are the lines of Christ, the spirit, the church, and the gifts. In 2 Corinthians the gifts are replaced by the ministry which is produced through sufferings. The lines of Christ, the spirit, and the church in 2 Corinthians are spoken of in a very deep and subjective way.</P><P>We want to continue our fellowship on the line of the spirit in 2 Corinthians, the line of the divine Spirit with the human spirit. We have pointed out that there are nine aspects of the wonderful, all-inclusive, divine Spirit in 2 Corinthians. He is the anointing Spirit, the sealing Spirit, the pledging Spirit, the writing Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the ministering Spirit, the liberating Spirit, the transforming Spirit, and the transmitting Spirit. In chapter thirteen we see the communion, the fellowship, the transmitting, of the Holy Spirit. That is the conclusion of 2 Corinthians. In chapters one and three are the remaining eight aspects of the Spirit. In chapter one we see the anointing, sealing, and pledging aspects of the Spirit. In chapter three there are another five aspects: the writing, life-giving, Christ-ministering, liberating, and transforming aspects. No doubt, the apostle Paul wrote 2 Corinthians with the thought of these eight aspects of the deeper work of the all-inclusive Spirit. This is why they are placed at the first part of this book.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ANOINTING SPIRIT</H2><P>The first of these eight aspects is the anointing (1:21), and the last is the transforming (3:18). We have seen that God anoints us, paints us, with the compound Spirit, a compound of all the ingredients and elements of Christ's person and work. This ointment is the best heavenly paint, full of the riches of the Godhead and full of the riches of the person, work, and attainments of Christ. The more we are anointed, painted, with the compound Spirit, the more the elements of Christ's person and work are dispensed into our being. These elements are the Triune God in His divinity, Christ's humanity, His wonderful death with its effectiveness, and His resurrection with its power. All of these elements are included in this heavenly paint, the compound Spirit. This painting, this anointing, brings all these elements into our being.</P><P>Eventually, the transforming Spirit transforms us into His image. This is God's goal, His intention. God anoints us, paints us, with Himself for the purpose of transforming us to make us the real sons of our Father with the image of the Father. The divine painting, the anointing, is for the transforming. The anointing brings in all the elements, and the transforming makes us exactly the same as the Son of God in life and nature, transforming us into His image from glory to glory even as from the Lord Spirit. The ointment, the compound Spirit, is the Lord Spirit. By Him and from Him we are being transformed into His image.</P><P>The Triune God with His divinity mingled with humanity and including His wonderful death and resurrection is today the compound ointment to anoint us with all that He is and all that He has done so that we might be transformed into His image, and this transformation is from the Lord Spirit. We are being anointed, and eventually we will be transformed. I hope that the churches will pay more attention to this matter of anointing for transformation.</P><P>The more doctrinal teaching we receive, the more knowledge and concepts we gain; but the anointing brings in the substantial, real elements of Christ into our being. If I paint you with paint, you may not understand it, but you still are painted. Teaching brings in vain knowledge, but the anointing brings in the real substance.</P><P>We may be taught much about the death of Christ, but what we need is the substance and reality of the death of Christ itself. His death is in the all-inclusive, compound Spirit. When I was young, I was taught about the death of Christ in Romans 6 and that we had to reckon ourselves as being dead (v. 11). But this is just the teaching of the death of Christ, not the reality. The reality of the death of Christ is in the Spirit, spoken of in Romans 8.</P><P>When we call on the name of the Lord, we receive the riches of the all-inclusive Spirit (Rom. 10:12). When we are about to lose our temper, we can call on the Lord's name, and the killing power of Christ's death is there to kill our temper. But the more that we try to reckon ourselves dead, the more we will be defeated, because this reckoning is the exercise of the mind. When we forget about the exercise of the mind and exercise our spirit by calling on the name of the Lord, we touch the compound Spirit. In this compound Spirit, there is the divine germicide to kill all the negative things in our being. The germ killing, the killing death of Christ, is not in the teaching but in the compound Spirit. The Christian life is not a matter of knowing doctrines but a matter of being anointed by the compound Spirit.</P>
