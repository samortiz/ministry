<h1 class="title">THE REASON FOR THIS BOOK</h1><P>By the mercy of God, in 1947 the church in Shanghai in China experienced a great revival. When the news spread to other places, the churches in the provinces of Fukien and Kwangtung, together with the church in Hong Kong, invited me to visit them. At the same time, co-workers from northern and southern China, together with co-workers from the West, decided to come together in Shanghai the following year for a co-workers' conference and to share the Lord's grace one with another. Consequently, toward the end of 1947 Sister Peace Wang, Rachel Lee, and I first went to Hong Kong. Afterwards we went to Canton, Swatow, and Amoy. Finally, in March the following year we went to Foochow. In all these places we held special revival conferences. After the meetings in Foochow, the two sisters and I went according to our previously-arranged schedule to have some private fellowship with Brother Nee at his home concerning the future of the Lord's recovery. When the news went out, about thirty to forty co-workers around the Foochow area unanimously requested that they be admitted to the fellowship also. Upon Brother Nee's approval, they all attended those meetings. During these meetings, it was brought out one day the need of "handing over" oneself. All agreed enthusiastically to do this. Subsequently, this move brought in the recovery of Brother Nee's ministry. First, Brother Nee took care of the need of the meeting in Foochow. After that, he went with me in April of that year to Shanghai to conduct a nationwide co-workers' conference. Throughout this period, Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi and his wife were in most of the meetings. The content of this book is their brief records of these meetings in various places.</P><P>Of all these meetings throughout this period of the recovery of Brother Nee's ministry, I was present in all except the first two meetings, and I was even helping to conduct the meetings. I sat face to face with our brother and heard these messages with my own ears. The light that was released  was like the shining of the midday sun. Forty-three years have since elapsed. There is indeed the need at present to let its light shine forth once again as the rising sun. Fortunately, under the Lord's sovereignty, we have with us the remaining manuscripts of the brief records by Brother Weigh and his wife. When I read them again, every message was filled with the dawning light. What impressed me the most and rendered me the greatest help are eight things: (1) the knowledge and realization of the Body of Christ, (2) the knowledge and denial of the self, (3) the knowledge of and submission to the authority in the Body of Christ, (4) the knowledge and acceptance by the co-workers of the "line of Jerusalem," (5) the service and coordination of the whole Body of Christ, (6) the need and practice of handing over oneself with all one has, (7) the leading and coordination among the co-workers, and (8) the importance of the Holy Spirit in the service in the Body of Christ. May the Lord grant us the mercy, the grace, and the blessing, that all the above points would be abundantly realized in our work and service of the Lord's recovery.</P><P>Witness Lee<br />Anaheim, California<br />July 19, 1991</P>
