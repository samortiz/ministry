   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. The Destruction of the Temple and the City;</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Their Being Scattered Again</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before the Lord was crucified, He prophesied in Matthew 24:2 that not one stone of the temple would be left upon another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicated that the temple would be destroyed and the people would be scattered again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This prophecy was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when a Roman prince, called Titus, came and destroyed the city and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the people crucified the Lord, they said, His blood be on us and on our children Matt 27:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since then they have been suffering from evil treatment, the edge of the sword, famine, and pestilence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They have been consumed from generation to generation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Roman army, in A.D. 70, killed approximately two million people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Over half of the remaining ones died of starvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The rest were sold off to be slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Fifty years later, another fifty thousand were killed because they rebelled against the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every one was scattered throughout the earth to suffer for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before the second world war, tens of thousands were killed in Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were driven to an open area and massacred by machine guns and grenades.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During the second world war, six million people were killed by the German army.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Various devious means were used to execute them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were like sheep led to the slaughterhouse Psa 44:22; Jer 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>J. Their Being Kept as a People</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Numbers 23:9 says, Lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They were not like any other people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The culture, food, and living habits of all other people were dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only the Jewish people were clean.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, to them, the other people were considered to be swine and dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They would not live and eat with other people, so they dwelt by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They were without a country for 2,500 years, but they were preserved as a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It usually takes about five hundred years for a people to lose their identity after their country is destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, because of God s prophecies in the Bible concerning Israel, He kept them separated from the different nations among whom they dwelt, so that they would remain a distinct people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>K. The Restoration of the Nation of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord kept them as a people so that, after 2,500 years, they could restore their nation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the Bible, the nation of Israel had to be restored before the end of the world could come Rom 11:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The restoration of the nation of Israel took place in 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to human concepts and experience, this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With man it is impossible, but with God all things are possible Luke 18:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible also prophesied that Jerusalem will be trampled by the nations until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled Luke 21:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jerusalem was returned to God s people in 1967.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This fact also confirms the Lord s word that His second coming is near Matt 24:33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Conclusion</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the Bible and the people of God are tied together, their history and existence today proves to us that the Bible is truly the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE PROOF BY ITS INDESTRUCTIBILITY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During the course of human history, there has not been a book that has been attacked as much as the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every attack has failed; the Bible has never been destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>People can easily destroy a car or a building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Almost everything that exists can be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, the Bible, the Word of the eternal God, is indestructible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is indestructible because the Author is eternal and needs a book to speak for Him eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The people who attack the Bible wither away, but the Bible has remained from the beginning until now.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Finite people existing in time can never destroy something that is infinite and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Conversely, the more people try to destroy the Bible, the more people read it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Around A.D. 300, Caesar Diocletian of the Roman Empire used many cruel methods to try to do away with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He almost destroyed every copy of the Bible that existed at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He also killed tens of thousands of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He erected a monument with an inscription that claimed that the Christian faith had been exterminated Extincto Naminechristionorum .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Twenty years later, the Bible reappeared in public again.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There was a high official in England called Engersol.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He vigorously opposed the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He sought out every copy of the Bible and burned it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But after he died, his residence was bought by the Bible Society for printing Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Engersol died, but the Bible lived on.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No one can outlast the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No one can destroy the Bible.</S>
