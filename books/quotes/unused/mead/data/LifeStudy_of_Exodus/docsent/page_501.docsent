   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-SEVEN THE HOLY ANOINTING OIL 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:22-33; Psa 133:2; 1 John 2:20, 27</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall begin to consider the holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This oil is a compound of four spices blended with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first thing we need to see is the position of this ointment in the divine record in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to find out why it is revealed at the end of chapter thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we understand the position of the ointment, then we shall know the relationship between it and the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE POSITION OF THE OINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The book of Exodus begins with God s chosen people suffering as slaves in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, the children of Israel made a great exodus from that condition of slavery, crossed the Red Sea, came into the wilderness, and enjoyed God s provision.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even while they were in Egypt, they enjoyed the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They also experienced God s mighty salvation, for God delivered them out of Egypt and rescued them from the strong hand of Pharaoh and his army.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the wilderness God s people tasted the heavenly food, the manna, and also drank living water out of the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By God s mercy they experienced many miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The children of Israel were brought to Mount Sinai, where they stayed for probably ten months or more.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At Mount Sinai they received the revelation from God that He wanted them to build a tabernacle for Him to have a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, through this tabernacle God could have the best communion, the best fellowship, with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, at Mount Sinai God gave Moses the heavenly design of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Beginning with chapter twenty-five of Exodus, we have a detailed description of the tabernacle and all its furniture and utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This record is completed at the end of chapter twenty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then in chapter twenty-eight the divine revelation comes to the matter of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First we have a record of the clothing of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then in chapter twenty-nine God reveals what kind of food the priests should eat.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This chapter shows how the priests are sanctified and filled with the riches of the things required by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, by the end of Exodus 29 the priests are ready.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter thirty we first have the incense altar and then the census for the divine draft to form God s army.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In foregoing messages we have pointed out why the draft for the formation of God s army follows the description of the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason is that the incense altar is the motivating factor for God s move, and God s move requires an army.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The army must fight for God s move so that the way is clear for God to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Exodus 30 we also have the laver, which was not far from the entrance of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before entering the tabernacle to serve God, the priests had to wash their hands and feet in the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Following the description of the laver, we have the record concerning the holy anointing oil, the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This ointment sanctified the priests, the tabernacle, and all the furniture and utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, there was the need for the tabernacle, the furniture, the utensils, and also the priests to be anointed with this oil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before the end of chapter thirty, the time was not right for God to speak of the anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now we can understand why the record of the anointing oil is found toward the end of chapter thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s revelation is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It proceeds step by step and even section by section.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Egypt the children of Israel enjoyed the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the wilderness they enjoyed the manna and the water from the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A DEEPER TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many Christians know the Passover lamb, the heavenly manna, and the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A number of hymns have been written on the Passover, the manna, and the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, many Christians have never read a book or listened to a message on the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Recently I looked into what others had to say regarding the compound ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In his Synopsis J. N. Darby has only a short word on the ointment and the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In his notes on the Pentateuch, C. H. Mackintosh says that in the holy anointing oil we discern a type of the varied graces of the Holy Ghost, which were found, in all their divine fullness, in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But he does not tell us what these graces are.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The writing of C. A. Coates on Exodus 30 shows a great improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With respect to the ointment, he uses the term the Spirit of Christ many times.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Few writers use this expression; most speak of the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, or even the Holy Ghost.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, Coates speaks of the Spirit of the Man of God s pleasure and also of the Spirit of another Man even of the Man who is at God s right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that Coates saw that the Spirit of Christ is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of another Man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Concerning the four spices, Coates says that they represent all those features of grace which were so perfectly blended and harmonized in the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Coates realized something concerning the blending of the spices with the olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Four kinds of spices were compounded with the olive oil to make the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The anointing oil in Exodus 30 certainly signifies one of the deeper truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am concerned that some among us have not yet realized much concerning this deeper truth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, we need to know the significance of the compound ointment.</S>
