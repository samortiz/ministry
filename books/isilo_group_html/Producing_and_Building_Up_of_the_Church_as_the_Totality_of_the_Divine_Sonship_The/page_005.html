<h1 class="title">THE PRODUCING AND BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH THROUGH<br />
THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; 13:44-46; Eph. 5:25-27; 2:15-16; John 12:24; 20:17-22; Heb. 2:11-12</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have the church. Ephesians 1:4 and 5 say, &ldquo;He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship.&rdquo; The church is the totality of the divine sonship, which is a corporate, not an individual, matter. In this chapter and the next we will consider how the church is produced and built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH TODAY BEING<br />
THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>The Gospel of Matthew speaks much concerning the church. The first mention in the Bible of the word <em>church</em> is in Matthew 16. Verse 18 speaks of the church, and verse 19 mentions the kingdom. In these two verses <em>church</em> and <em>kingdom</em> are used interchangeably, showing that in the view of this Gospel, the church is the kingdom, and the kingdom is the church. The proper church life today is the kingdom of the heavens. These are two aspects of one entity.</p>
<p>Matthew begins with two wonderful, precious names: Jesus, which means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior,&rdquo; and Emmanuel, which means &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (1:21-23). About thirty-three years after His birth, this Jesus brought His disciples close to the border of the Holy Land. There He asked His disciples who men said that He was. Peter received a vision to see who Christ is. He answered, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (16:16). Immediately, Jesus told Peter, &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (v. 18). It is as if the Lord was saying, &ldquo;Peter, you have seen the vision of Christ, but now I will reveal to you something further. To see only Christ is not sufficient. You must see another part of the heavenly vision. The heavenly vision includes not only Christ but also the church.&rdquo; Christ and the church are the two sections of the spiritual mystery (Eph. 5:32) and the heavenly vision (Acts 9:1-5; 26:19).</p>
<p>Matthew 16:19 continues, &ldquo;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; Most fundamental teachers agree that there were two keys. Peter used one key to open the door for the Jews on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:38-42), and he used the other to open the door to the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius (10:34-48). We can never separate the kingdom from the church. The teaching of the Brethren is too dispensational, stating that the age of grace is the age of the church, not of the kingdom, and that the age of the kingdom will be the next age. According to this teaching, when Christ came, He brought the kingdom with Him, but when the Jews rejected Christ, the kingdom was suspended and will remain suspended until Christ returns with the kingdom. Therefore, today we are in the church but not in the kingdom. However, according to the New Testament, the kingdom has not been suspended. In Acts 1:3, for example, the Lord Jesus came to His disciples after His resurrection, and for a period of forty days He spoke to them concerning the kingdom, not the church specifically; yet what was produced and established in the book of Acts was the church. This proves again that <em>kingdom</em> and <em>church</em> are interchangeable terms, denoting different aspects of one entity. Romans 14:17 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Romans 14 is a chapter on the proper church life, but it speaks concerning the kingdom of God today. Again, this indicates that the kingdom is the proper church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING A TREASURE HIDDEN IN THE FIELD</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16 we first see the church, but we do not see the details of what the church is. The Bible is wonderful, and it does not always give us all the details about a matter in one place. Rather, it reveals a small portion in one place and another portion in another place. We may compare this to a jigsaw puzzle. We do not keep the pieces of a puzzle in a meaningless pile. Rather, we need adequate time and wisdom to put all the pieces together in a significant way. Do not ask the reason that the Lord reveals His mysteries in the divine Word in such a puzzle-like way. This is simply the case. To see more concerning the church and the kingdom, we must consider the parables in Matthew 13. The seven parables in chapter 13 are in three groups. The first four are one group. These parables speak of food. In the first parable, a sower went out to sow some seeds to grow wheat, and in the second parable, tares were sown in the field as false food. The third parable concerns a mustard seed, and the fourth parable speaks of leaven hidden by a woman in fine flour. This group of four parables denotes that the church as the kingdom of God on the earth today produces something that is good to eat.</p>
<p>The second group of parables is the parable of the treasure hidden in the field (v. 44) and the parable of a merchant buying a fine pearl (vv. 45-46). Just as the first four parables refer to things that are grown, this pair of parables speaks of things that are transformed. The treasure hidden in the field must be composed of gold or precious stones. Both precious stones and pearls are transformed materials. First Corinthians 3:9 says, &ldquo;You are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo; The farm is for growing, and the building is built with precious materials (v. 12a). Therefore, the first group of parables in Matthew 13 is for growing, and the second group is for transformation. The third group is a single parable, the parable of the net (vv. 47-50).</p>
<p>The treasure in verse 44 is hidden in the field, and the pearl in verse 46 comes out of the sea. In typology, a field signifies the earth created by God for His kingdom. This is indicated in Genesis 1:26-29, which says that God created man to express God and exercise His dominion over all the creatures, and the restored earth grew the things that were good for man to live on. This means that the earth is something positive used by God to exercise His kingdom in the universe. The sea, on the other hand, signifies the people in the world corrupted by Satan (Isa. 57:20; Rev. 17:15). The four beasts in Daniel 7 signify the kings of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire. These great evil men came from the stormy sea, the Gentile world (vv. 2-3). Likewise, in Revelation 13 Antichrist also comes up out of the Gentile world, represented by the sea (v. 1). Therefore, it is very meaningful that the treasure in Matthew 13 is hidden in the field, and the pearl comes out of the sea. This means that the treasure in the field is the kingdom of God on His created earth. We should not be disappointed and think that God has given up the earth. Regardless of how rotten, corrupt, dark, and evil the world is today, we can be assured that one day the earth will be cleared up, all the evil things will be swept into the universal trash can, the lake of fire, and the Lord will set up His kingdom on the cleared-up earth. This day is close at hand. Today the Lord is sweeping through this earth in judgment, not by water but by fire. Eventually the earth as the field will be a good place for His kingdom. Today, however, the kingdom is hidden in the field.</p>
<p>The treasure hidden in the field signifies the kingdom as an aspect of the church. In the eyes of God, the church is a precious treasure. The man who bought the field is Christ. Christ found the treasure and in His joy went to the cross to sell all that He had and buy not only the treasure but the entire field, redeeming the created and lost earth for God&rsquo;s kingdom. Now the earth is not only created by God but also purchased by Christ. The grand title deed of the earth is now in Christ&rsquo;s hand. It is not too much to say this. In Revelation 5:1-7 the scroll that Christ takes from God&rsquo;s hand is the new covenant, the grand title deed in the universe, enacted with the blood of the Lamb (Matt. 26:28). Christ is the unique One who is fully entitled and qualified to take that deed, because He was the One who fully paid the price for it. Only someone who pays for something has the right to its deed. Christ alone is the proper Owner. He paid the price on the cross to purchase the entire earth so that one day the kingdom will be exercised on it. Revelation 11:15 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.&rdquo; Every inch of this earth belongs to Christ. We do not agree that any part of the earth belongs to anyone else. All others are usurpers; Christ is the unique Owner. Moreover, He is coming back to claim the earth (10:1-2). Then He will say to all the usurpers, &ldquo;Who are you? Go to your place in the lake of fire.&rdquo; If we truly know the New Testament, we will see this clearly. Wherever I have traveled, I have said, &ldquo;This is my Lord&rsquo;s property. Temporarily it is usurped by the enemy, but one day my Lord will come to claim what is His.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now we can see what the church is. The church is a treasure hidden in the field. Most people cannot see it. They cannot believe that in their own locality there is a treasure. This treasure is the church. The outward, apostate church is fully manifested, but one day it will come to nothing. The genuine church, on the other hand, is hidden yet solid. Only those who have the vision can see the church, which is solid, precious, and worthy yet hidden.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Producing and Building Up of the Church as the Totality of the Divine Sonship &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
