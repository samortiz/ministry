<h2 class="head1">BEWARE OF PRIDE</h2><p>We should also beware of pride. To be proud is to boast. You may not boast openly, but you may boast hiddenly of your spiritual capacity, ability, and capability. Sometimes people boast in this way, saying, &ldquo;See what capacity I have. Can your capacity or ability compare with mine?&rdquo; Even someone without much capacity may still boast that he can do what others cannot. To be proud is also to exalt yourself and despise others. Again I ask, &ldquo;Who does not exalt themselves and despise others?&rdquo; I have learned this lesson, I have experienced all these things, and I have seen the situations. Therefore, I do have a burden within me to speak to you all, and I feel that this is the time to speak a word of love concerning ambition, pride, self-justification, and not being conformed to the death of Christ.</p><p>To be proud is also to think of yourself more highly than others. To be sure, this is a common illness among all Christians. Therefore, Paul charged us, saying, &ldquo;For I say, through the grace given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith&rdquo; (Rom. 12:3). Although the Lord has been gone for nearly two thousand years, why does it seem that almost nothing has been accomplished for the building up of the Body? It is simply because of all these &ldquo;gophers.&rdquo; Paul was very aware of the matter of pride. He said that a new convert should not be appointed to bear responsibility because, being blinded with pride, he may fall into the judgment suffered by the devil (1 Tim. 3:6). I have seen this. In appointing certain ones into responsibility there is the risk of spoiling them with pride.</p><h2 class="head1">BEWARE OF SELF-JUSTIFICATION<br />AND EXPOSING OTHERS&rsquo; FAILURES AND DEFECTS</h2><p>We must also beware of self-justification and exposing others&rsquo; failures and defects. We often like to justify ourselves and expose others&rsquo; shortages, mistakes, and defects. Among us some are very particular in doing this, justifying themselves all the time. We never hear that certain ones condemn themselves, but rather they are always justifying themselves while exposing others&rsquo; failures and defects. To be snared in this way is to justify yourself and speak well of your success and merits. It is to speak of how you succeeded in this work or in that work and to speak well of all your good points. I wish to put this message into your mind so that you may keep it in your memory. Then you can look and see our situation. The situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is exactly like this.</p><p>As I have said before, the spirit of not shepherding and seeking others and being without love and forgiveness is spreading in the recovery everywhere. I believe that not having the Father&rsquo;s loving and forgiving heart and not having the Savior&rsquo;s shepherding and seeking spirit is the reason for our barrenness. I realize that you all work hard, but there is almost no fruit. The Lord says, &ldquo;By the fruit the tree is known&rdquo; (Matt. 12:33), but we are a tree without any fruit. Everywhere among us barrenness is very prevailing. A good, gentle, pastor may not have a particular gift, such as the gift of speaking; he may simply visit people and welcome them when they come to his meeting, but according to statistics, he will have a ten-percent yearly increase. We, however, do not have even a ten-percent increase. Can you see how barren we are? Many of you are good speakers, knowing the higher truths. The truths we hold are much higher than those in Christianity. However, we do not have fruit because we are lacking in the Father&rsquo;s loving and forgiving heart and the Son&rsquo;s shepherding and seeking spirit. We condemn and regulate others rather than shepherd and seek them. We are short of love and shepherding. These are the vital factors for us to bear fruit, that is, to gain people. I am very concerned for our full-time training. Do we train the young ones to gain people or to regulate people? We have to reconsider our ways, as Haggai said (1:5). Our way is not right; something is wrong.</p><p>We often condemn others, exposing their failures and defects. We must admit that to speak well of ourselves and to expose others&rsquo; defects is our natural disposition. Our disposition is like this by birth. There is no need for us to speak about others&rsquo; defects, but we may simply like to do it. Many times the brothers come together and speak about others&rsquo; weak points, defects, and failures. I have learned the lesson to be fearful and trembling about speaking of others&rsquo; defects. In the world the legal term for this is <i>defamation.</i> Why do we need to speak in a defaming way? However, nearly all of us do this. Because by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace I have learned the lesson, it is very hard for you to hear me speak of anyone&rsquo;s defects. Whenever I speak of others&rsquo; shortages, I am condemned, saying to myself, &ldquo;Do you not have shortages?&rdquo; The Pharisees and scribes brought a sinful woman to the Lord and said, &ldquo;In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What then do you say?&rdquo; (John 8:5). First, the Lord stooped down. This was to show them humility. He did not stand, saying, &ldquo;What! Do you come to Me? Let Me tell you something!&rdquo; The Lord stooped down to write on the ground. According to my study of the Bible, I believe that what the Lord wrote was, &ldquo;Who is without sin?&rdquo; It is as if He said, &ldquo;There is no doubt that she is sinful, and she got caught. But are you without sin?&rdquo; They charged the Lord to say something, so He said, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her&rdquo; (v. 7). Their conscience was caught. Everyone, beginning from the older ones, the experienced ones, was smitten. Who is without sin? When you speak of others&rsquo; shortages, do you not have shortages? Yet according to our disposition by birth, to speak about others&rsquo; defects is our &ldquo;hobby.&rdquo; Do you like to expose your own shortages? You do not; you like to cover them.</p>
