   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THAT THE UNIQUE BODY OF CHRIST MAY BE EXPRESSED THROUGH THE VARIOUS LOCAL CHURCHES Receiving All Genuine Believers Unconditionally according to the Way God and Christ Receive Them</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we live a life with the highest virtues, the church will become a coordinated and built-up Body that is expressed in all the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, chapter fourteen shows us the unique Body of Christ expressed in all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason, all the churches have to receive all genuine believers unconditionally, according to the way God and Christ receive them Rom 14:1-3; 15:7 , for the practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to learn the practical lesson of receiving the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here Paul used eating and the keeping of the Sabbath as examples.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said that some are still keeping the Sabbath, and others are still eating according to the ceremony of cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But as long as they have all believed in the Lord, we have to receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although those who keep the Sabbath are wrong, God still receives them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the Jewish believers may keep the ceremonies of the Old Testament, God receives them also.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's receiving is not based on the question of the Sabbath or the ordinances of eating, but on man's believing in Jesus Christ the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our receiving of the believers is based on God's receiving of them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, all the churches have to receive them also.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we receive in this way, according to God instead of according to doctrine or methods, we maintain the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Treating All Genuine Believers according to Christ</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After receiving them, we still have to treat all genuinely saved believers according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 15:5 says: "Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has Christ Jesus as the standard in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the church life, everything must be according to Him, instead of according to doctrines and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No matter how different others are from us in doctrinal views or religious practices, we must learn to treat them according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must treat them not only according to Christ's mind, but according to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way we will be able to think the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Walking according to Love</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 14:15 Paul said, "But if because of food your brother is grieved, you no longer walk according to love."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No matter how different others are from us in concept or practice, we should not criticize or judge them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, we are not walking according to love, and we will be putting a stumbling block before others, thus causing others to stumble, and damaging the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Living in the Light of God's Judgment-Seat</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 14:10 also tells us that we should not judge others in anything, because "we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day, God's judgment-seat will reveal all our deeds and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, today, we have to live and work under the light of God's judgment-seat in everything.</S>
