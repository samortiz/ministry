   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VERSE TWENTY-ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 21: "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Each church has its own special circumstances and its own specific temptations that it should overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Outwardly, this church seems to have none of these; there seem to be no persecutions, heresies, or filthy sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It had merely fallen into worldliness, riches, and self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These are the things the Lord is calling it to fight against.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Overcoming and defeat here have nothing to do with eternal life or eternal death, because through God's predestination and grace, the problem of a believer's salvation has already been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The overcoming here refers to whether or not these ones have kept their stand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Have they maintained the testimony of Christ through their words and conduct?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Are they qualified to receive the reward?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How did they overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the nature of overcoming?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To what degree do they have to overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"As I also overcame."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All overcoming should be like the Lord Jesus' overcoming, although not all overcomers can be like the Lord in His overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among all of the Lord's promises, here is the only place that makes reference to the path the Lord took on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How did the Lord overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What did He overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christians today focus on sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems a marvel enough if one can overcome sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course, to overcome sins is a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But what the Lord Jesus meant here is not the overcoming of sins because according to the Lord's view, the overcoming of sin is the common qualification of every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord spoke about His own overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His overcoming is the overcoming of firstly the world, and secondly Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out" John 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are what He overcame.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Saints should not spend all their lives fighting against sins only.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should go on to war with the world and the ruler of this world and overcome them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Himself said, "Take courage; I have overcome the world" John 16:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord overcame the world through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it" Col 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus overcame Satan and all his armies through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the world?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is the common people, our environment, and everything that tries to pull us down from our high spiritual ground.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should overcome them instead of being pressed down by them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Anything that is against the Father is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should fully obey God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not for a moment be overcome by worldly conversations, worldly temptations, worldly atmosphere, or worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What is Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not only overcome the material world; we should also overcome the world of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The spirit of the antichrist which is the spirit of Satan is now waging war everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the saints should overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The believers should overcome Satan and all his works in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is working in the world and behind the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord has overcome them already.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now He is calling His people to overcome them as He did.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John told us concerning these two overcomings in 1 John: 1 "For everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory which has overcome the world our faith" 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>2 "You have overcome the evil one" 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"You are of God, little children; and you have overcome them evil spirits because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world" 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Believers should not be satisfied only with overcoming their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As the Lord overcame the world and Satan through the cross, we should also overcome the world and Satan through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The reward for the Lord Jesus' overcoming is to sit with the Father on His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If this principle of reward according to works is applicable to the Lord Jesus, no doubt we must have the proper works if we desire to be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To try to receive the reward by grace is as wrong as to try to receive salvation by works.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because of the complete obedience of the Lord Jesus, God rewarded Him by seating Him together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The kingdom was given to the Lord Jesus because of His obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"But of the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners" Heb 1:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we overcome, how will the Lord treat us?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we can follow Christ's deeds and His overcoming, we will receive the glory and the kingdom with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Here we see two thrones.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The throne on which Jesus is now sitting is the Father's throne which is in heaven and not seen by men.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord did not promise anyone to sit with Him on that throne.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The future throne of the Lord Jesus will be seen by men; it will be the throne of David, the throne of the Lord as Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This throne will be in the millennial kingdom and will be in Jerusalem Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>43:7; Luke 1:32; Psa 45:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Overcomers will sit with the Lord on this second throne.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the new heaven and new earth come, the Son will no more sit separately from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At that time, the throne will be "the throne of God and of the Lamb" Rev 22:1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now is not yet the age of Christ's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the Lord Jesus comes down in glory and establishes His kingdom, the overcomers will reign as co-kings with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Now is the time for the saints to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord is now preparing those who will be co-kings with His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Because the future glory is great, the position high, and the works abundant, today's preparation cannot be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Only those who have definitely overcome today are qualified to be kings in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is no possibility for faking here.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It must be an individual overcoming and it must be an overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today's circumstances, trials, and temptations are just training for the future kings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whether or not one is qualified, up to the standard, or strong enough is fully manifested through all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Today's defeated ones will not be qualified to reign with the overcomers in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Those who cannot rule over everything today will not have the power to rule over everything in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The last message the Lord spoke to Laodicea is a call to be co-kings with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As long as they overcome, they will be able to enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The throne of glory is the most encouraging thing to the saints who have been saved but are now backsliding.</S>
