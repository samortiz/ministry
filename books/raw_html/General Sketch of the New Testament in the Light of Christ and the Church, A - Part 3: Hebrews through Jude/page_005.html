<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST AS THE APOSTLE FOR GOD’S BUILDING SUPERIOR TO MOSES </h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 1:1-3; 2:3, 5; 3:1-4, 6; 4:8-9, 11-13</h1><p>As the book of Hebrews speaks about the difference between Christ and Judaism, it tells us who Christ is and what Christ has done; that is, it reveals the person and work of Christ. If we intend to know Christ, we must know His person and His work. The opening verses of this book are a short introduction, giving an all-inclusive description and definition of the person and work of Christ. Hebrews 1:1-3 says, “God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son, whom He appointed Heir of all things, through whom also He made the universe; who, being the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance and upholding and bearing all things by the word of His power, having made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.”<h2 class=head1>THE PERSON OF CHRIST IN HEBREWS 1 AND 2</h2><h2 class=head2>The Son</h2><p>According to these verses, the person of Christ is first the Son. The Son is a very special and specific term. As we know, God is triune—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. These are not three different Gods but the three of the one Triune God. Verse 8 of chapter one says, “But of the Son, ‘Your throne, O God.¼’” Here, the Son is called God. Not only is the Father God, but the Son is also God, just as the Spirit is God. All three—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—are God. Therefore, the very opening verses tell us that the person of Christ is the Son in the Trinity. In the ancient times God spoke in the prophets, but at the last of these times God speaks in the Son, the person of Christ, who is God Himself.<h2 class=head2>The Appointed Heir of All Things and the Creator</h2><p>Before the foundation of the universe, Christ was appointed Heir of all things, and then at the time of creation Christ was the One through whom all the universe was created (v. 2). The Amplified New Testament renders universe as “the worlds and the reaches of space and the ages of time.” The universe includes space and time, all the physical, material things, and all the systems, orders, laws, and principles. All these things added together comprise the universe, which was created by God through Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Effulgence, the Impress, and the Bearer</h2><p>Christ is one thing to God, and He is another thing to God’s creation. To God, Christ is the effulgence of God’s glory and the impress of His substance (v. 3a), while to creation, Christ is the One who bears all things by the word of His power (v. 3b). By this we can see that God and all His creatures are related to Christ. The effulgence of God’s glory is outward to glorify God, while the impress of God’s substance is inward. Christ is the very glory of God outwardly and the impress, the image, of God’s substance, God’s being, what God is.
