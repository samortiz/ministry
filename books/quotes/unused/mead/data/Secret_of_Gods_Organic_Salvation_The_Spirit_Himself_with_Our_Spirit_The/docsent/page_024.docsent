   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit s Operation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The building is also by the Spirit s operation, distributing to each member different gifts for the building up of the Body 1 Cor 12:4, 7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit s distributing different gifts to different members is the actual building work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rewarded by Christ</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The building work with gold, silver, and precious stones will be rewarded by Christ at His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, if the work is with wood, grass, and stubble, it will be burned on the day of the Lord s coming 1 Cor 3:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If your work in building up the church is by your natural man, by your fallen, fleshly man, or by anything that issues from an earthen source, your work will not be rewarded but instead it will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Testament reveals that at the end of this age there will be three burnings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation 17:16 indicates that Catholicism will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Matthew 13 the Lord Jesus indicates that the tares, the false Christians in Christianity, will be burned vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>24-30, 40-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The false Christians have caused great damage to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will send His angels to collect all the tares, bind them into bundles, and burn them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the burning of the false believers in Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The third burning will be that mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3:13-15: The work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one s work, of what sort it is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If anyone s work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward; if anyone s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we build the church with God the Father as gold, with God the Son as silver, and with God the Spirit as precious stones, we will receive the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if we do the work of the building by the natural man, by the fallen man, and with things that issue from the earthen source, our work will be burned, yet we ourselves will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all need to consider how we are building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should be those who are building with the Divine Trinity as the precious and transformed materials.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>F. The Consummation of the Divine Building 1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Church as the House of God</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The consummation, the accomplishment, of the divine building is the church in many localities as the house of God to be God s dwelling place, the holy temple in the Lord 1 Tim 3:15; Eph 2:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The consummation is also the Body of Christ in the whole universe as the expression of Christ Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the churches are one Body, and the co-workers should be doing not a regional work but a universal work for the universal Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In fact, all the believers in Christ have been baptized into one Body by the Spirit 1 Cor 12:13a .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In practicality, based on the fact, all the believers have to be built together into the Body of Christ Eph 4:12 by the builders of the divine building through the age of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>G. The Destroyers of the Divine Building</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In addition to all the positive things which we have covered in this message, there is one category of negative persons the destroyers of the divine building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the New Testament there are seven kinds of destroyers:</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who blow the wind of divisive teachings by stressing things other than the central teaching concerning God s economy Eph 4:14; 1 Tim 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who preach and teach heresies 2 Pet 2:1; 2 John 7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who are factious, sectarian Titus 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who make divisions Rom 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who are ambitious for position 3 John 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who are wolves, not sparing the flock Acts 20:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who speak perverted things to draw away the believers after them Acts 20:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When some hear that there are destroyers of the divine building, they may say, Is this not the divine building, the building of God?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How can anyone destroy it?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In a sense, no one can destroy the divine building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, many are stirred up by the enemy and try their best to destroy the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we have indicated, the first kind of destroyers are those who blow the wind of divisive teachings by stressing things other than the central teaching concerning God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, the New Testament teaching regarding baptism by immersion is a minor teaching, but the Southern Baptists make it a major teaching and in so doing their teaching becomes divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The principle is the same with every denomination: they are built upon a particular teaching, and they teach things other than the central teaching concerning God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Regarding such a situation, Paul exhorted Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach different things...rather than God s economy, which is in faith 1 Tim 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all need to be careful not to take any teaching, even a scriptural one, and make it a central teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Throughout the years Brother Nee and I have not stressed anything other than the central line of God s economy concerning the church for the producing of the Body to consummate the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This central teaching is not divisive; on the contrary, it builds up the Body.</S>
