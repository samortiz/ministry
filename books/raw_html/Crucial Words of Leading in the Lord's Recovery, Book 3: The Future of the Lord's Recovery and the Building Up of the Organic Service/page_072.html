	 <h2 class="head2">Concerning Young Full-timers</h2>
<p>In his second ministry journey, Paul went to Lystra, and the church recommended a young man named Timothy (16:1-2). Timothy can be considered the first young full-timer among Paul&rsquo;s co-workers. He was not brought up by Paul; instead, he was brought up and recommended to Paul by a local church. In 1 Timothy Paul said to him, &ldquo;Do not neglect the gift which is in you, which was given to you by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery&rdquo; (4:14). The presbytery in this verse refers to the elders in Lystra who were only relatively mature. Paul did not lay hands on Timothy by himself; he did this together with the local elders in Lystra. Based on their laying on of hands, Timothy was under the elders. Notwithstanding this, Paul later charged Timothy to appoint elders. Initially, Timothy, a full-timer, was like an apprentice under the elders. After a period of time, he became an apostle and was qualified to appoint elders. When he began to serve full time, his service was based on the laying on of the hands of the elders. But at a certain time he had the maturity to appoint elders and could lay hands on the elders (5:22). Even an accusation from two or three witnesses against an elder could be presented to Timothy (v. 19). This means that a charge against an elder was brought to Timothy. Paul also told Timothy that when an elder sinned, he should reprove the elder before all, not privately (v. 20). Paul did not play politics. If a rebuke was needed, Paul indicated that it should be done publicly. This is different from our present practice. Paul&rsquo;s practice was to publicly rebuke any elder who sinned so that other elders might hear and be warned. Regrettably, such practices have been replaced by a willingness to be political. We play politics, but Paul did not.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Raising Up Prophets and Teachers</h2>
<p>In the local church in Antioch there were prophets and teachers who were raised up by the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:1-2). Barnabas was a Levite (4:36). He belonged to the priestly tribe, and he was raised up by the Holy Spirit after his salvation. Acts 13 says that Barnabas was one of the prophets and teachers in Antioch. It is difficult for us to determine whether he was a prophet or a teacher. However, whether he was a prophet or a teacher, he was not appointed by men; he was raised up by the Holy Spirit. Saul of Tarsus, who once opposed the churches, was among these prophets and teachers. After he was gained by the Lord, his whole being was revolutionized, and he began to preach the Lord Jesus. Even though the disciples were fearful of Paul, Barnabas contacted him, served with him in the work, and ministered together with him. Thus, Paul became one of the prophets and teachers in Antioch. Both Barnabas and Paul were not appointed by men. This is strong proof that prophets and teachers are not appointed by men. They are not like today&rsquo;s pastors who need to be ordained by human hands.</p>
<p>The prophets and teachers in Acts 13 were appointed by the Holy Spirit. We do not know when they were appointed by the Holy Spirit. The Bible says only that there were prophets and teachers in the church life in Antioch. As they were ministering to the Lord, the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them&rdquo; (v. 2). The moment they set out for the ministry, they became apostles. Even as apostles, they were not sent out by men but were appointed by the Holy Spirit to preach the gospel. The result of their gospel preaching was the raising up of local churches. Afterward, they appointed elders in the churches.</p>
<p>After churches came into existence and elders were appointed, young people who loved the Lord and desired to serve Him full time were raised up in these localities. Timothy is an example. After the church in Lystra was raised up, the local elders laid hands on a young full-timer named Timothy. After he participated in the work and gained experience, he was charged to appoint elders by the laying on of his hands. If an elder in a locality sinned, the witnesses could go to Timothy to present their accusation against the sinning elder.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT&rsquo;S ORGANIC ACTIONS</h2>
<p>The record in the Bible does not reveal the development of an organization. Acts 13 clearly says, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me...They then, having been sent out by the Holy Spirit...&rdquo; (vv. 2, 4). This shows that the setting apart and the sending out of the apostles was organic. Furthermore, Paul appointed elders in every city. This seems to be organizational, but in 20:28 Paul said, &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers.&rdquo; This shows that the appointment of the elders was by the Holy Spirit. It was the Holy Spirit who appointed the elders to be overseers of the flock to shepherd the church of God. In chapter 14 Paul appointed elders in every church (v. 23), but in chapter 20 he said that the Holy Spirit appointed the elders. This proves that when Paul appointed the elders, he was in spirit. Therefore, he was able to say that his action was the action of the Holy Spirit. Paul did not say that he had the position to appoint elders as an apostle sent by the Lord. If this was the case, the elders he appointed would not have been the elders the Holy Spirit appointed.</p>
<p>Concerning the appointment of elders, we should be able to say with confidence that the elders we appoint are elders appointed by the Holy Spirit. In 2 Timothy 1:6 Paul referred to his laying on of hands, saying, &ldquo;Fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.&rdquo; Timothy needed to fan into flame the gift he received through the laying on of Paul&rsquo;s hands. When the elders and Paul laid hands on Timothy, a gift was bestowed on him. This indicates that the laying on of hands was the operation of the Holy Spirit. In other words, the laying on of hands by the presbytery and Paul was organic, not organizational. It was an organic action of the Body of Christ. Therefore, a spiritual gift was transmitted from the Body of Christ into Timothy. This proves that this action was not organizational; it was absolutely organic.</p>
<p>Timothy was a young person, yet Paul charged him, saying, &ldquo;Let no one despise your youth&rdquo; (1 Tim. 4:12). Timothy was a young apostle, but he could appoint elders, reprove elders, and even remove someone from the eldership. Paul encouraged Timothy not to be timid, because God had not given Timothy a spirit of cowardice but of power, love, and sobermindedness (2 Tim. 1:7). Paul also charged him to fan that gift into flame (v. 6). All the charges in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles to Timothy were based upon this gift. The gift in Timothy&rsquo;s spirit was not a gift of cowardice, but it needed to be fanned into flame. Therefore, Timothy did not carry out the charges in these Epistles by his own effort but by the gift that was fanned into flame, that is, by his burning spirit. His actions were not organizational; they were organic.</p>
<p>Paul also said that Timothy should know how to conduct himself in the house of God based on the Epistles Paul had written (1 Tim. 3:15). Just as Timothy received this word from Paul, the elders need to receive this word so that we may know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God. In the house of God, the church of the living God, we cannot be organizational. We can only be organic. The house of God is the church of the living God; it is the pillar and base of the truth. The house of God is also the great mystery of godliness&mdash;God manifested in the flesh (vv. 15-16). This house is God manifested in the flesh. Our activities in the house of God must not be according to organization. Instead, everything we do in the house of God must be organic; it must be according to the mysterious manifestation of God in the flesh. This is not organizational; it is organic.</p>
<p>We truly hope that while leading the churches, the elders in all the localities would not forget that we are in the house of the living God. We are not in an organization, not in the denominations, much less in a social organization. We are in the house of the living God, which is the manifestation of God in the flesh. Hence, when we serve as elders, all our actions and decisions must be the manifestation of the living God&mdash;they must be organic. We all should have this basic knowledge. According to history, the apostle joined the presbytery to lay hands on a young full-timer. Later, this young full-timer could appoint elders, reprove elders, and remove someone from the eldership. All these matters were not done organizationally. They were organic.</p>
