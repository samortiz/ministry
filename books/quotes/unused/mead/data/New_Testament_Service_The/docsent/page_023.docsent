   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUTSIDE OF CULTURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John s way of living not only offended religion, but it also offended culture.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was not only outside of religion, but also outside of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It seemed that there was no culture at all with him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He ate wild honey and locusts, and he remained in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What kind of person is this?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He offended the religious people, and he also offended the cultured ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all need to realize that, if we would give a strong testimony for Christ, we need to be completely outside of religion and outside of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am afraid that we are still too refined and too cultured.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No doubt we are a people with a high culture.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we remain in our culture, however, we are through as far as Christ is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the strong witnesses of Christ need to be wild, according to the principle of John the Baptist, and they need to give up religion and culture as well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may tell us today that, if we would testify for Christ, we need to have much education with many degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, John the Baptist, who was the first witness, the first martyr of Christ, kept nothing of religion and nothing of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By wearing camel s hair and eating locusts and wild honey, he was no doubt considered wild ; he was fully outside of religion and outside of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we read the history of the church from the first century to today, we see that whoever remained in culture and religion was through with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be the living witnesses of Christ, we need to be outside of religion and outside of culture, and we may find that we offend the religious ones and the cultured ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A CHANGE OF CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What did John do when he came forth to minister?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Did he teach the Ten Commandments?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Did he teach one of the five books of Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first word that came out of his mouth was Repent!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This word in Greek means to change your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It means to have a change in your life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to change our mind and change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John did not teach from any book of the Bible, he did not teach any commandment, and he did not teach any part of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first word he uttered was Change!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You need to have a change in your concept.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>NO SCRIPTURAL GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some have argued with me by saying that the coming of John the Baptist was prophesied in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no doubt about this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Isaiah said that he was a voice crying in the wilderness Isa 40:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, where could you find any prophecy concerning John s baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the entire Old Testament you cannot find such a prophecy, for the baptism of John was something entirely new.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In fact, there was no scriptural ground for it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, many would even say that it was unscriptural!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus was very wise when the Pharisees questioned Him regarding His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not answer, but instead turned the question to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He asked them if the baptism of John was of heaven or of man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was a very wise question, for there was no scriptural ground for John s baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Pharisees were troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there was scriptural ground, the Pharisees surely would not have any argument.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet they dared not say that John s baptism was of man lest they risk being stoned, for the multitude recognized John as a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Neither could they say that it was of heaven, because the Lord would then ask them why they did not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To them it seemed that the best way was to follow the liar, Satan, and tell a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They told the Lord Jesus that they did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord answered them by saying that He would not tell them either.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In effect, He said, I know that you know, but you will not tell Me; therefore, I will not tell you either.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Praise the Lord, the Lord is really the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>John the Baptist did something for which he had no scriptural ground, something unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To the religious people, it may seem that this is not at all right.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He did not take care of the law; he simply told people to change their mind and their concept.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If they would do so, he would bury them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That was all.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The way he lived, the way he talked, and the way he acted surely offended religion and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For this reason the religious ones rejected him and condemned him, and the political ones put him into prison, where he was eventually beheaded.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In principle, this is the destiny of the witnesses of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In a sense, it is our destiny to offend people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we are outside of religion, we will surely offend the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not care for culture, we will offend the cultured world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In that case, in principle our destiny will be the same as John s.</S>
