   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 8: "Your Father knows the things that you have need of before you ask Him."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some say that since God already knows our need before we ask, we do not need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They also say that it is better not to pray than to have short prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, this verse does not mean that we should not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, it means that we should not go to God to give a report.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although God knows our need, He is still waiting for us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nonetheless, He does not want us to report.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, "Lord,...we are perishing!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matt 8:25 is a report, but "Lord, save us!" is a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not right to notify God, but it is right to make requests of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This verse is to discourage prayers that are in the nature of a report.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 9: "You then pray in this way."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This does not mean that the prayer that follows should be used as a form.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, it means that the disciples should take it as an example of prayer and learn to pray in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verses 9-13: When the Lord was on the earth, this was the only time that He taught people to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the other occasion, recorded in Luke, it was the disciples who asked the Lord to teach them to pray Luke 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the words there were similar to the words here, the two were given on two different occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From the prayer here we can get some clue.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the Lord taught us to pray just these few sentences, we can see what God wants us to pray in these few thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of God's desire and all that He is intent on accomplishing speedily are expressed through this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This prayer shows forth God's eternal will and God's desire toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This prayer contains the word "Your" three times and the word "us" four times.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's name is not sanctified by people on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Neither is God's authority exercised on the earth, nor is God's will done on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The purpose of God is to have His will done also on earth, as it is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This sentence is a great key to understanding this section.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From this it can be seen that in heaven God's name is sanctified and God's will is done.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, on earth other names are sanctified, the kingdom of darkness exists, and an opposing will is present.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan is the ruler of this world and the god of this age, and in his hand the whole world lies John 12:31; 2 Cor 4:4; 1 John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should preach the gospel to deliver people out of the hand of the evil one that they may sanctify God's name and be subject to God's authority, so that God's kingdom may come to this very earth on which we stand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today's Christians bear a great responsibility, that of bringing the kingdom to the earth through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why is Satan still in the world today?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is because those who belong to Christ have not experienced the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At least one of the reasons that God created man was that God does not want to cast out a created being Satan directly as a Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fact that God in that day charged Adam to keep the garden of Eden shows that there was an enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The authority that God gave to Adam was that which He had previously given to Satan, who was originally the archangel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The serpent was cursed to eat dust, which is the substance with which man was formed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that man fell and was subjected under the authority of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's original intention was to have man cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since the first man Adam failed, God raised up the second man Christ to overcome Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through His death the Lord redeemed man from sin, and He did the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord joined every saved one to Himself that they all may exalt God, do God's will, and destroy the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This group of people corporately form the second man Adam in order to do the will of God on earth as it is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Mr. Evan Roberts said that the wheel of prayer is as follows: 1 God initiates, 2 man prays, and 3 God accomplishes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ezekiel 36 shows us a great principle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God first said that He will give Israel a new heart, yet He still wants them to inquire of Him, and then He will accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 9: "Our" includes all Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only Christians can call God their "heavenly Father"; people in the world cannot address God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Your name be sanctified."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is what God has always demanded for thousands of years.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 10: "Your kingdom come."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, we may say that the kingdom of God is already in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the other hand, we may also say that it has not come and is waiting for the believers to pray for its coming.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verses 11-13: These are our askings, in which "us" is used four times.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 11: This is asking God to give us our daily bread.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since Christians do not have savings on earth, they need to ask for their daily bread.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 14: "For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some say that this passage is spoken to Jews and indicates something different from the forgiving mentioned in Ephesians 4:32.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is incorrect.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The reasons are as follows: 1 If this passage was spoken to Jews, how could God be addressed as the heavenly Father?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Adam was called the son of God only because he was created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>2 Since words such as "offenses" and " heavenly Father" are used, we know that a father-son relationship with God still exists when sins are committed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, these are sins committed after one has been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>3 The sins of the Jews are not forgiven because they forgive others; they still need the sin-cleansing fountain in the future Zech 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The forgiveness here is not the initial forgiveness of sin; rather, it refers to the forgiveness of our daily weaknesses and offenses after we have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For these we need to forgive others in order to receive forgiveness from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If a believer does not forgive others, he forgets that he has received forgiveness from God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God cannot allow two believers who have a disagreement with each other to enter into His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At least one, if not both, will not be able to enter.</S>
