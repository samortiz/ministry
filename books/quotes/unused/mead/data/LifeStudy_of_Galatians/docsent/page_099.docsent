   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING THE SPIRIT AS OUR GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul s words strongly imply that we must make a decision with respect to our aim, our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Will our aim be the flesh, or will it be the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 6:8 Paul speaks of sowing unto the flesh and unto the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek preposition rendered unto means with a view to or resulting in. To sow unto the flesh means to sow with a view to accomplishing the purpose of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is to have the flesh as the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But to sow unto the spirit means to sow with a view to accomplishing the purpose of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is to have the Spirit as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit should be not only our life and walk, but also the goal of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no neutral ground between the flesh and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our goal is either one or the other.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It cannot be anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In different ways, both the flesh and the Spirit are all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The flesh includes everything apart from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gossiping, criticizing, shopping in a worldly way, reading the newspaper apart from the control of the Spirit all these are aspects of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you intend to take the flesh as your goal?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is the goal of your life on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I hope that you all will be able to say that your goal is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sowing unto the Spirit includes calling on the Lord, praying, ministering Christ to others, and fellowshipping in life that others may be edified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also sow unto the Spirit when we use our money for the Lord s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we sow unto the Spirit, taking the Spirit as our goal, we shall not go shopping in a worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, our shopping will be governed by the fact that we have chosen to take the Spirit as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the Spirit is our goal, then everything in our daily life will be with a view to this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul s burden in the book of Galatians was to reveal Christ in such a way that He would be not only the focal point of God s economy, but also the focal point of our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has revealed Christ into us, and now we need to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the revelation presented in the first two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we have seen, Paul goes on to point out how we can experience such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would experience Him, we must have the Spirit as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This requires that we have a divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we should walk by the Spirit and take the Spirit as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not aimless people who wander about without a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have a clear, definite aim the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Spirit is our goal, everything in our daily life will become meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The way we dress, how we arrange things in our room, where we go, even what we eat all will be a sowing unto the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Spirit is our goal, we live on earth with a view to this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if we let the flesh be our goal, we shall eventually reap corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This corruption may affect not only us, but also our family and even our descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In His grace, the Lord wants to help us take the Spirit as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The way we talk to others, the way we spend our money, and every aspect of our living should be with a view to this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Young people, I encourage you to make up your mind to take the Spirit as your goal.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I would even suggest that you make a vow to the Lord concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may want to say, Lord, I call heaven and earth to witness that I make a vow to take the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as my goal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I want whatever I say and do to be toward this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Lord, I don t want to sow anything that will result in corruption for me or others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I want to sow unto the Spirit and reap eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Everything I do, I want to do toward the goal of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 6:10 Paul says, So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good toward all men, and especially toward those of the household of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul s mention of the household of faith immediately after his word about sowing indicates that our sowing affects the household of the faith, which includes all the believers on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What you sow today will have an effect on the household of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not think, for example, that the way you cut your hair is a matter of no significance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In cutting your hair you sow either unto the flesh to reap corruption or unto the Spirit to reap eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, your sowing has an effect on the saints and even on the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you sow unto the Spirit, the result will be a supply of life to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we see this, we shall surely desire to take the Spirit as our goal and live unto this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have the assurance that if we live unto the Spirit by sowing unto the Spirit, we shall reap a harvest of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This will be a great benefit to ourselves, our families, the saints around us, and even all the churches on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we receive grace from the Lord to live Christ, we shall sow unto the Spirit and take the Spirit as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The result will be life eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead of causing corruption, we shall be able to minister the life supply to those with whom we have direct contact.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Moreover, because we have been sowing unto the Spirit, even those who contact us only indirectly will receive something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is no need to try deliberately to carry on a work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we live unto the flesh, what we do as a Christian work will not be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What counts is not our working, but our sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every detail of our living is important because it is part of our sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we sow unto the Spirit in all the small parts of our daily living, we shall have a life unto the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The issue of this kind of life is life eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When our goal is the Spirit, we become a supply of life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A GLORIOUS GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I say once again that we believers are not aimless.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have a goal, an aim that controls and directs us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whatever we do, we do with a view toward this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In drawing the Epistle to the Galatians to a close, Paul charges us to sow unto the Spirit, to live unto the Spirit, to say and do everything with a view to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As sons of God, we need to take the Spirit as our unique and eternal goal.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I urge you to take the Spirit as your goal in life that you may become one who supplies life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Tell the Lord, Lord, from this time forth, my goal is the Spirit and only the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I m so happy that I have such a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>My life is meaningful, for I have a goal which directs me and controls me in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord is sounding out the call in His recovery to take the Spirit as our goal and to live unto Him in everything that there may be a harvest of life eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>How wonderful that we may have such a glorious goal in life!</S>
