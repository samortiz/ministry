   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After soulish believers have learned the doctrine concerning the differentiation between the spirit and the soul, they can easily understand such a teaching with their natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Spontaneously they can find many soulish activities in other people's lives and easily understand other's soulish acts and thoughts, but they do not realize that they are as soulish as the ones whom they accuse of being soulish and that they are actually no less soulish than others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most soulish believers have a great deal of spiritual knowledge, but their experiences can never match what they know.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because they know much, they also condemn much in their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, criticizing others becomes a common characteristic of soulish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They receive grace to have knowledge, but unlike spiritual believers, they do not receive grace to have humility.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, there is a certain hardness in their dealings with people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To those who are closely associated with them, they give the impression of having a certain "stiffness," a hard shell.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are not like spiritual believers whose outer shell has been broken so that they are approachable and kind to others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regardless how much soulish believers give credit to the grace of God and give glory to God outwardly, all their thoughts are always centered on "self."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether they consider themselves good or bad, their thoughts can never depart from themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They have not yet lost themselves in God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Soulish believers are very proud.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since their thoughts are always centered on themselves, they cannot help but be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What hurts them the most is being set aside either in work or in the evaluation of others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is very unbearable to them when other people misunderstand them and talk about their shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are not yet like their more spiritual brothers who gladly accept what God has arranged for them, whether exaltation or rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are not willing to be despised by others, to appear inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even when they have received more grace of God to know the actual condition of their natural life so that they realize how corrupt they are and humble themselves before God, even regarding themselves as the worst in the world, they think that they are more humble than others and boast in their humility!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Pride is often in the deepest part of their heart, unknown to others or even to themselves.</S>
