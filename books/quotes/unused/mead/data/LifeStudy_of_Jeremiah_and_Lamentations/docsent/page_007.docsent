   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lamentations 3:22-25 says, "It is Jehovah's lovingkindness that we are not consumed, / For His compassions do not fail; / They are new every morning....</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>/ Jehovah is my portion...</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>/ Therefore I hope in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>/ Jehovah is good to those who wait on Him."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here Jeremiah speaks not of God's love but of His lovingkindness and of His compassions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Compassion is different from mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Compassion is a tender, inward feeling, and mercy is the outward expression of this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jehovah's compassions, like the dew, are new every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Immediately after speaking of God's lovingkindness and compassions, Jeremiah utters a personal word: "Jehovah is my portion...I hope in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here Jeremiah seemed to be saying, "Although the children of Israel have been exiled, I still have hope in Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope in the One whose lovingkindness and compassions toward us do not fail.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is my portion, and He is good, not only to me, but to all who wait on Him."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jeremiah 23:5 and 6 say, "Behold, days are coming, / Declares Jehovah, / When I will raise up to David a righteous Shoot; / And He will reign as King and act prudently / And will execute judgment and righteousness in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>/ In His days Judah will be saved, / And Israel will dwell securely; / And this is His name by which He will be called, / Jehovah our righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This "righteous Shoot" is Christ incarnated to be a descendant of David in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the time this word was written, David's descendants had become evil, and it seemed that no more kings would come out of David's tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But Jeremiah prophesied that one day God would raise up a new sprout, a new branch, a righteous Shoot, to reign as King and act prudently.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word regarding Christ's reigning as a King will be fulfilled in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As Isaiah 53 indicates, the word regarding Christ's acting prudently refers to His acting wisely in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, the fact that His name will be called "Jehovah our righteousness" means that He has something to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here His name is not called the righteousness of Jehovah, but Jehovah our righteousness, indicating that He becomes one with us to be our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This also is a New Testament thought.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fourth portion I would like to consider is Jeremiah 31:33 and 34.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"This is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And they will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them, declares Jehovah, for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law spoken of here is related to the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is saying that He will put His life into them and that with this life there is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, this life is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may use an apple tree as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>An apple tree has its own law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The law of an apple tree is the life of the apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of this law, an apple tree spontaneously produces apples.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no need to say, "Apple tree, I command you not to produce bananas but to produce apples.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Also, your apples should be round and not square."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The life of the apple tree will regulate it in such a way that it will produce apples.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The principle is the same with our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our human life has a law which regulates our living as human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The divine life is the highest life, and this life within us is an inner law that regulates us.</S>
