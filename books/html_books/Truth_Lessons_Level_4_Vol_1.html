<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this volume we will focus our attention on the prophecies in the Bible. One-third of the whole Bible is prophecies. Some of these prophecies have become historic facts, whereas others have not yet been fulfilled. According to their content, prophecies can be categorized as follows: (1) prophecies concerning Christ; (2) prophecies concerning the church; (3) prophecies concerning the believers; (4) prophecies concerning Israel; (5) prophecies concerning the Gentile nations; (6) prophecies concerning Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet; (7) prophecies concerning the last of the seventy weeks spoken of in Daniel 9; (8) prophecies concerning the millennium; and (9) prophecies concerning the new heaven and new earth in eternity. In this volume we will present the prophecies in the Bible concerning Christ, the church, and the believers. Before entering into the content of each of these prophecies, we need to understand the importance of prophecies and the proper attitude that the believers should have in studying prophecies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROPHECIES<br />
IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Believers Needing to<br />
Give Heed to Prophecies</h2>
<p>Not many believers consider the prophecies in the Bible to be important. Some think that prophecies are not interesting and are difficult to interpret. Others think that pursuing spiritual gifts, holiness, and the kingdom is crucial and urgently needed but to know and understand prophecies is secondary and optional. There are also those who think that the result of studying prophecies is merely the addition of knowledge and is not profitable for growth in spiritual life. These are all misconceptions.</p>
<p>Prophecies are matters that God requires man to know, and believers should give heed to them. Second Peter 1:19 says, &ldquo;We have the prophetic word made more firm, to which you do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s word indicates that the word of the Old Testament prophets confirms and strengthens his testimony of Jesus Christ (vv. 16-18) and is an inoculation for the believers against heresies and apostasy.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus also charged us to understand the prophecies (Matt. 24:15). This clearly shows that the believers must pay attention to the prophecies in the Bible. If the church does not pay adequate attention to these prophecies, many believers will inevitably lose faith, be deceived by lies, be &ldquo;destroyed / Because of a lack of that knowledge&rdquo; (Hosea 4:6), and forget the Lord&rsquo;s coming by not being watchful.</p>
<p>In his Epistles, Peter encourages the believers to give heed to the prophetic word made more firm, that is, to give heed to the prophecies when studying God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. As to a Lamp Shining in a Dark Place</h2>
<p>Peter likens the word of prophecy in the Scriptures to a lamp shining in a dark place. This indicates that this age is a dark place like a dark night (Rom. 13:12), and all the people of this world are moving and acting in darkness. If the believers do not have the prophecies in the Bible, they too will fall into darkness. Therefore, we need the prophetic word of the Scriptures, as a shining lamp, to convey spiritual light that shines in the darkness (not merely knowledge in letters for our mental apprehension), guiding us to enter into a bright day, even to pass through the dark night until the day of the Lord&rsquo;s appearing dawns. Before the Lord as the sunlight appears, we need this word as light to shine on our footsteps (Psa. 119:105).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Until the Day Dawns and the Morning Star Rises</h2>
<p>Peter tells us to give heed to the prophetic word until the day dawns and the morning star rises in our hearts. This word is a metaphor, illustrating a coming time that will be full of light, as a bright day dawning, with the morning star rising, before dawn, in the hearts of the believers who are illuminated and enlightened. If we give heed to the prophecies in the Bible as a shining lamp within us, we will enjoy the morning star rising in our hearts until the spiritual day dawns within us. In the time of apostasy the believers do well to give heed in this matter so that the prophetic word, as a lamp, may shine through the darkness of apostasy until such a day dawns upon them. This will cause and encourage them to earnestly seek the Lord&rsquo;s presence and be watchful so that they will see the Lord as the morning star when He comes in secret (Matt. 24:27; 2 Thes. 2:8).</p>
<p>Hence, this metaphor alludes to the coming age, the age of the kingdom, as a day that will dawn at the appearing (the coming) of the Lord as the Sun of righteousness (Mal. 4:2), whose light will shine and break through the gloom of the dark night of this age. Preceding this, the Lord will appear as the morning star (Rev. 2:28; 22:16) in the darkest hour of the night to those who are watchful and looking for His dear appearing (2 Tim. 4:8). The believers who give heed to the prophecies in the Bible will have Christ rising in their hearts to shine in the darkness of today&rsquo;s apostasy, before His actual appearing as the morning star.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Prophecies Being Reliable,<br />
Trustworthy, and Firm</h2>
<p>Second Peter 1:20-21 says, &ldquo;Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of one&rsquo;s own interpretation; for no prophecy was ever borne by the will of man, but men spoke from God while being borne by the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; These two verses prove that the prophetic word is altogether reliable, trustworthy, and firm. No prophecy of Scripture is of the prophet&rsquo;s or writer&rsquo;s own concept, idea, or understanding. The will, desire, and wish of man with his thought and exposition are not the source of any prophecy. The source is God. Men were borne and carried along by the Holy Spirit to speak out the will, desire, and wish of God. Therefore, these prophecies are God&rsquo;s word, God&rsquo;s speaking. For this reason, we should believe and take heed to all the prophecies in the word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE PROPER ATTITUDE OF THE BELIEVERS<br />
IN STUDYING PROPHECIES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Not Being Careless</h2>
<p>The Bible is a very accurate book; not even one word is wrong, and not a single word should be misread or replaced. If a person is careless, he will miss God&rsquo;s word. A person reading prophecies must be careful and accurate. If a person is inaccurate, the accuracy of God is sacrificed. For example, at the time of Christ&rsquo;s first coming, the people of Israel were expecting the coming of their God-promised Messiah (Luke 3:15; John 1:19-25, 45-46) to rescue them out of the hands of the Roman imperialists. Before the Lord Jesus was born, a number of the children of Israel were expecting to meet their Messiah because they came to know, at least partially, the prophecies of the Old Testament, which spoke of God giving His people a Messiah, the anointed One. However, many of them did not know that Jesus was actually born in Bethlehem. Thinking that Jesus, who was called a Nazarene, came from Galilee, they rejected Him and missed the coming of the Messiah in their time (John 7:40-42; cf. Matt. 2:1-12, 19-23; Luke 2:39; Matt. 3:13). Due to a lack of fineness and accuracy in understanding the Old Testament prophecies, the chief priests and scribes missed the first coming of Christ. Today we also may have only a general understanding of the prophecies and not know them so accurately or finely. This may cause us to miss the second coming of Christ and suffer loss. Thus, we must learn to know the prophecies accurately and not be careless.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Not Being Curious</h2>
<p>In trying to be accurate, we must not become curious. God&rsquo;s Word is accurate, but we must never search it with a curious mind. If we search God&rsquo;s Word with a curious mind, we will altogether miss its spiritual worth. The Bible is a spiritual book. If the purpose of achieving accuracy is the satisfaction of our curiosity, rather than the satisfaction of our spiritual needs, we are on the wrong track. Studying prophecies is not for the purpose of satisfying a curiosity about the future; studying prophecies is for the sake of waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s return. If we are a curious person, even spiritual things of value will become non-spiritual and dead when they fall into our hands. This is a very serious matter. When we study the prophecies, we must not be curious; rather, we should touch life, touch the spirit, and touch the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Not Interpreting Prophecies out of Context</h2>
<p>The prophecies in the entire Bible are consistent, developing from one another and explaining each other. The phrase <em>one&rsquo;s own interpretation</em> in 2 Peter 1:20 can also be translated &ldquo;interpreted according to the meaning of it.&rdquo; This means that any portion of a prophecy cannot be interpreted according to its own limited context. If prophecies were written according to the will of individuals, they could be interpreted by themselves, and there would be no need to care for the other prophecies. However, the prophecies in the Bible were written by different men under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, even though many men wrote, the thought was one. Only the Holy Spirit is the Author of all the prophecies; hence, all the prophecies can be linked together as one. Thus, the prophecies of the Old Testament and of the New Testament must correspond. All the various prophecies should correspond to each other. Furthermore, the Old Testament prophecies were made firm by Jesus Christ the Lord and by some of the apostles in the prophecies of the New Testament. In other words, the New Testament prophecies confirm the Old Testament prophecies to make the Old Testament prophecies more firm. Thus, in studying prophecies, we must not consider only one portion in isolation; instead, we must compare it with other passages and must interpret the Bible with the Bible. Peter considered this principle to be the &ldquo;first&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:20). If we interpret prophecies out of context, confusion will be inevitable. This is not permissible in biblical interpretation. Any interpretation of prophecies must match the testimony of the whole Bible, and it must be mutually confirmed by the whole Bible in order to have the proper interpretation.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Keeping the Words of Prophecy</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:6-7 says, &ldquo;These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place. And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this scroll.&rdquo; This indicates that prophecy is not merely for us to ponder and consider. Prophecy can be kept, and he who keeps prophecy is blessed. We should not look down on prophecy. To look down on prophecy is to look down on God&rsquo;s glory and grace. We should not merely read and hear the prophecies (1:3) but also keep the prophecies so that we can gain the blessing of keeping the prophecies according to the Lord&rsquo;s promise. To keep the prophecies is to obey and follow the prophecies and even to be governed in our daily walk by the prophecies. When we obey wholeheartedly and even unconditionally, we can live a life preparing for the Lord&rsquo;s return.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Needing to Have<br />
an Intimate Relationship with God</h2>
<p>A person who pursues an understanding of prophecies must have an intimate relationship with God. According to the Scriptures, Enoch was the first person to prophesy, that is, to predict. When he was sixty-five years old, he had a son whom he named Methuselah (Gen. 5:21). This name has a prophetic significance; it means &ldquo;when he is dead, it will be sent.&rdquo; Hence, this name was a prophecy of the coming judgment by the flood. After Enoch received the prophecy regarding the flood, he rose up and left that ungodly age. Moreover, he was taken by God and did not see death (vv. 22-24). Abraham was a person who foreknew the move of God. Because he was &ldquo;the friend of God&rdquo; (James 2:23), God said, &ldquo;Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?&rdquo; (Gen. 18:17). Daniel saw visions and recorded prophecies, because he was a &ldquo;man of preciousness&rdquo; to God (Dan. 10:11, 19; 9:23). The apostle John wrote the visions in the book of Revelation, because he was the disciple whom the Lord loved and he had the experience of reclining on the Lord&rsquo;s breast (John 21:20). These examples prove that &ldquo;the intimate counsel of Jehovah is to those who fear Him, / And His covenant will He make known to them&rdquo; (Psa. 25:14).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>One-third of the Bible is prophecies. Believers must give heed to the prophecies as an inoculation against heresies and apostasy. By giving heed to the prophetic word, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, the believers will also receive shining and encouragement and be watchful to seek the Lord&rsquo;s presence so that they will see the Lord as the morning star when He comes in secret. The word of prophecy spoken by the prophets is altogether reliable, trustworthy, and firm, because the prophecies in the Scripture are not of man&rsquo;s own interpretation, but men being borne by the Holy Spirit spoke from God. For this reason, we should give heed to, pay attention to, study, and enter into this living word.</p>
<p>Believers should hold the following attitudes when studying prophecies. We should not be careless in studying the prophecies. The Bible is a very accurate book, so as readers of the prophecies, we must be careful and accurate; otherwise, we will suffer loss. We should not be curious in studying the prophecies. The Bible is a spiritual book; therefore, when reading the prophecies, we must not be curious, but rather we should touch life, touch the spirit, and touch the Lord. We must not interpret prophecies out of context. The prophecies in the Bible were written by different men under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit; therefore, even though many men wrote, the thought is one. When studying the prophecies, we must not consider one portion alone; instead, we must compare it with other places and interpret the Bible with the Bible. Any interpretation of a prophecy must match the testimony of the whole Bible. We should keep the words of prophecy. Prophecies can be kept, and he who keeps them is blessed. To keep the prophecies is to obey and follow the prophecies and to be governed by the prophecies in our daily walk. We also need to have an intimate relationship with God. Some examples of people in the Bible who had an intimate relationship with God are Enoch, who walked with God and received the prophecy regarding the coming judgment by the flood; Abraham, who foreknew God&rsquo;s move, because he was the friend of God; Daniel, who saw visions and recorded prophecies, because he was a man of preciousness to God; and the apostle John, who received the visions in the book of Revelation, because he was the disciple whom the Lord loved.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will see how the Old Testament prophets prophesied to the people of God concerning the divinity and humanity of Christ before His incarnation. These prophecies show that Christ is God as well as man. He is a God-man, possessing both divinity and humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHECIES<br />
CONCERNING THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that in the Godhead, Christ is God. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; This verse not only speaks of Christ possessing divinity; it also indicates that His deity is eternal and absolute. From eternity past to eternity future He is God. Hebrews 1:3 says that He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of God&rsquo;s substance. Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; Romans 9:5 is clearer, saying, &ldquo;Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever.&rdquo; All these Scriptures sufficiently prove that Crist in the Godhead is God, possessing divinity. While the New Testament clearly reveals Christ&rsquo;s divinity, the Old Testament clearly prophesies that Christ is God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Eternally Unchanging Creator<br />
Whose Years Are Without End</h2>
<p>Psalm 102:25-27 says, &ldquo;Of old You laid the foundation of the earth, / And the heavens are the work of Your hands. / They will perish, but You endure; / Indeed all of them will wear out like a garment; / Like clothing You will change them, / And they will be changed. / But You are the same, / And Your years are without end.&rdquo; These verses prophesy that the Creator is the coming Christ in His divinity. This portion of the Scriptures also prophesies concerning the eternal nature of Christ: He is the eternally unchanging One, and His years are without end. He exists from eternity to eternity as the everlasting One who will never change. The fulfillment of this prophecy concerning Christ is spoken of in Hebrews 1:10-12. Based on this prophecy, we see that Christ is the Creator, who existed even before creation. The entire old creation will be terminated, but Christ will be the same, and His years will be without end. He remains forever and ever, from eternity past to eternity future. This is clear proof of His divinity, proving that Christ is God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Going Forth from Ancient Times,<br />
from the Days of Eternity</h2>
<p>Micah 5:2 says, &ldquo;You, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, / So little to be among the thousands of Judah, / From you there will come forth to Me / He who is to be Ruler in Israel; / And His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; According to the record in Matthew, the One from Bethlehem who is the Ruler of Israel is Christ (2:1, 6). However, Micah reveals that He is actually &ldquo;from the days of eternity.&rdquo; This means that Christ existed in eternity, before the creation of all things, and that He was preparing to come forth out of eternity into time. Hence, this verse refers to Christ&rsquo;s eternal nature, and it prophesies concerning Christ&rsquo;s deity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being God</h2>
<p>Psalm 45:6 prophesies that Christ is God. In this verse the psalmist proclaims, &ldquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; / The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.&rdquo; In the New Testament this word was fulfilled in Christ the Son. Hebrews 1:8 says, &ldquo;Of the Son, &lsquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.&rsquo;&rdquo; This reveals that Christ the Son is God Himself. Furthermore, Christ has the eternal throne in His divinity, and the scepter of His kingdom is upright. Many authorities of earthly governments today are not upright, but Christ&rsquo;s authority is altogether upright. The main aspect of Christ revealed in Hebrews is of Christ as the Son of God, that is, God Himself. Because of what He is and all the riches in His divinity, Christ has become &ldquo;so great a salvation&rdquo; to the believers (2:3).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Being the Mighty God and the Eternal Father</h2>
<p>Isaiah 9:6 prophesies, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us;... / And His name will be called... / Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; This prophecy adequately and clearly reveals Christ&rsquo;s divinity. Isaiah was written about seven hundred years before Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, but it clearly prophesied that a child would be born to us and a Son would be given to us and that His name would be called Mighty God and Eternal Father. In this verse <em>Mighty God</em> is paired with <em>child,</em> and <em>Eternal Father</em> is paired with <em>Son.</em></p>
<p>Luke 2:11-12 and John 3:16 speak of the fulfillment of this prophecy. Luke 2:11-12 says, &ldquo;Today a Savior has been born to you in David&rsquo;s city, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.&rdquo; Christ was incarnated and born as a baby, but the baby born in a manger in Bethlehem was the Mighty God. John 3:16 says, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.&rdquo; This verse is based on Isaiah 9:6. The Christ who was born as a baby is the Son given to us by God. Moreover, Christ the Son is the Eternal Father. As the child and the Mighty God are one person, so the Son and the Eternal Father are also one person. The baby born in the manger in Bethlehem was the gift given by God to us, and this gift is His Son, who is the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Eternal Father, and the Prince of Peace. When we receive this Christ, we receive God and enjoy all His riches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHECIES<br />
CONCERNING THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Old Testament contains prophecies not only concerning the divinity of Christ but also concerning the humanity of Christ. The Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ&rsquo;s humanity mainly speak of His humanity in relation to four persons: the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, the seed of David, and the branch of Jesse.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Seed of the Woman</h2>
<p>The first prophecy in the Old Testament, which is also the first prophecy in the entire Bible, speaks of Christ as the seed of the woman in His humanity. Jehovah God spoke to the serpent in Genesis 3:15: &ldquo;I will put enmity / Between you and the woman / And between your seed and her seed; / He will bruise you on the head, / But you will bruise him on the heel.&rdquo; This promise regarding the seed of the woman is the first prophecy in the Bible. In Isaiah 7:14 the prophet Isaiah prophesied, &ldquo;The Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.&rdquo; The birth of Jesus Christ of the virgin Mary fulfilled the prophecy of Christ being the seed of the woman in His humanity (Matt. 1:22-23). Paul also testified solemnly that Christ was &ldquo;born of a woman&rdquo; (Gal. 4:4). As the seed of the woman in His humanity, Christ is Emmanuel&mdash;God with us, and He has bruised the head of the ancient serpent, Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being God with Us</h2>
<p>Christ in His humanity was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin; hence, man called His name Emmanuel&mdash;God with us (Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:23). The <em>el</em> in <em>Emmanuel</em> means &ldquo;God&rdquo; in the original language. This means that He is God; He is the incarnated God living among us (John 1:14). Furthermore, He is not only God but also God with us. Christ in His humanity as the very Emmanuel not only was with the disciples when He was on earth (14:9) but also is with us, since His ascension, whenever we are gathered into His name. Moreover, He will be with us all the days until the consummation of the age (Matt. 28:20).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Bruising the Head of the Ancient Serpent, Satan</h2>
<p>Genesis 3:15 prophesies that Christ as the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the old serpent, Satan, and the serpent would bruise the heel of the seed of the woman. The fulfillment of the first half of this prophecy is referred to in Hebrews 2:14 and in 1 John 3:8, which reveal that through death Christ destroyed the devil, who has the might of death. This prophecy will be further fulfilled when the ancient serpent is cast down out of heaven by the man-child (Rev. 12:9). The last half of the prophecy&mdash;the serpent bruising the heel of the seed of the woman&mdash;was fulfilled when Christ&rsquo;s feet were nailed to the cross. By having the Lord Jesus&rsquo; feet nailed to the cross, Satan bruised His heel (Psa. 22:16).</p>
<p>Satan tempted the man, whom God created for Himself, to sin and rebel against God. He also imparted himself in his sinful nature into man to dwell in man&rsquo;s flesh (Rom. 7:17) and be man&rsquo;s nature, constituting man a sinner, dead in his spirit (Gen. 3:1-6), making himself one with man (Matt. 16:23; John 6:70; 8:44; 1 John 3:8a). In addition, man is held in slavery all his life by Satan through the fear of death (Heb. 2:15). As the seed of the woman, Christ in His humanity partook of blood and flesh, having the likeness of the flesh of sin and being involved with fallen man&rsquo;s flesh indwelt by Satan (v. 14; John 1:14; Rom. 8:3). Thus, through the death on the cross, Christ judged Satan, the enemy of God (John 12:31; 16:11), destroyed the works of the devil (1 John 3:8b), and destroyed the devil, who dwells in fallen man (Heb. 2:14), so as to free man. Eventually, the overcoming believers will execute God&rsquo;s judgment on the ancient serpent, Satan, and cast him down to the earth (Rev. 12:9-12). Before the millennium begins, Christ will send an angel to bind Satan and cast him into the abyss where he will be shut up for one thousand years (20:1-3). At the end of the millennium, Satan will be released from the abyss. He will then deceive the nations into following him to surround the camp of the saints and the beloved city. This will be the last struggle of fallen man to rebel against God. Then fire will come down out of heaven and devour them (vv. 7-9). The devil, who deceived them, will be cast into the lake of fire, where he will be tormented day and night forever and ever (v. 10). This is the last step of the executing of Christ&rsquo;s judgment on Satan, and it is also the final purging of the poison of rebellion against God that was injected into man by Satan.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being the Seed of Abraham</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that Christ in His humanity is the seed of Abraham (Matt. 1:1). This was prophesied in such places as Genesis 17:8 and 22:18. In Galatians 3:16 Paul emphasizes that Christ is the fulfillment of the prophecies in Genesis concerning the seed of Abraham: &ldquo;To Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed. He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one: &lsquo;And to your seed,&rsquo; who is Christ.&rdquo; Here Paul indicates that in God&rsquo;s eyes Abraham has only one seed, that is, Christ. As the seed of Abraham, Christ is typified by Isaac, who came out of Abraham and received the inheritance. Furthermore, Christ in His humanity blesses the nations so that the nations may receive the gospel of Christ, which is to receive the Spirit promised by God (v. 14).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Typified by Isaac</h2>
<p>Christ as the seed of Abraham in His humanity is typified by Isaac (Matt. 1:2). Jehovah God promised to give the land of Canaan to Abraham and to his seed as an eternal possession (Gen. 17:8), and He said that the nations on the earth would be blessed because of Abraham&rsquo;s seed (22:18). Nevertheless, the seed that God referred to was not many people, but one person. Paul pointed out in Galatians that this one is Christ, not Isaac. As far as Abraham was concerned the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; was Isaac. According to Galatians 3:16, in the eyes of God the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; who would receive the inheritance and bless the nations is Christ. Isaac is a figure of the coming Christ, and the reality is Christ. Christ in His humanity is the unique seed of Abraham; He is the seed that inherits the promise. In order to inherit the promised blessing, we must be one with Christ. Outside of Him we absolutely cannot inherit the God-promised blessing. We must be in Christ through faith in order to partake of all the promises God that gave to Abraham (vv. 7-9).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being for the Blessing of the Nations</h2>
<p>In Galatians 3:14 Paul says, &ldquo;In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ in His humanity is the seed of Abraham so that the nations can receive the gospel of Christ, which is the blessing God gave to Abraham (Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:8-12). Christ is not only the unique seed who inherits the promise as typified by Isaac; He is also the promise of blessing to be received by man. When Jehovah God appeared to Abraham, He promised to give him two things&mdash;the good land and the seed, both of which typify Christ. This means that in type, God was giving Christ to Abraham as the good land and the seed. According to Paul&rsquo;s interpretation in Galatians 3, both the good land and the seed are the Spirit. The blessing of the gospel is the promised Spirit. The physical aspect of this blessing that God promised to Abraham is the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4), which is a type of the all-inclusive Christ (cf. Col. 1:12). Since Christ in His humanity is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17) by the New Testament believers, this allinclusive life-giving Spirit is the blessing promised to Abraham.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being the Seed of David</h2>
<p>Matthew reveals that Christ as a man in His humanity is the seed of David (1:1; 22:42-45). This fulfilled the prophecy spoken by the prophet Nathan to David in 2 Samuel 7:12-14a: &ldquo;When your days are fulfilled and you sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, which will come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. It is he who will build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his Father, and he will be My son.&rdquo; In this prophecy we see that God would raise up a seed for David and would also establish His kingdom forever. The fulfillment of this is referred to in Revelation 11:15, which says that Christ &ldquo;will reign forever and ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This prophecy in 2 Samuel 7 says that the seed of David would become the Son of God, and God would be His Father. In other words, a human seed would become the divine Son. In Romans 1:3-4 this prophecy is explained fully: &ldquo;Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ in His humanity is the seed of David and that in resurrection His humanity was sanctified, uplifted, transformed, and designated the Son of God.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Building the Temple of God <br />
in His Resurrected Humanity, <br />
as Typified by Solomon</h2>
<p>Solomon typifies the resurrected Christ. Just as Solomon built and completed the temple of God, Christ in resurrection also builds His church to be the dwelling place of God on earth (2 Sam. 7:13a; Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22). <em>Solomon</em> means &ldquo;peaceful.&rdquo; Solomon is the king of peace. He built the temple of God in a peaceful situation. This typifies Christ building up the dwelling place of God in peace. Ephesians 2:15-22 reveals that Christ in His flesh abolished the law of commandments in ordinances, so making peace, and that in peace He is building the Body of Christ. Hence, the word regarding the seed of David in 2 Samuel 7 clearly prophesies that the resurrected Christ in His humanity is the seed of David for building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Designated the Son of God<br />
in Resurrection</h2>
<p>In 2 Samuel 7 Nathan not only prophesied that the resurrected Christ will build the church, God&rsquo;s temple, but he also prophesied that Christ in His humanity as the seed of David will be the Son of God, and God will be His Father. This is what is said in Romans 1; in His humanity Christ was designated the Son of God through resurrection (vv. 3-4). We must see that the person of Christ has two aspects. This God-man, Christ, possesses both divinity and humanity; He is God, and He is also man. Divinity is divine, and humanity is human. According to His divinity, Christ was already the Son of God. But as the seed of David, Christ in His humanity was still human, because He had put on flesh (John 1:14). According to the flesh, in His humanity Christ was &ldquo;in the likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 8:3). Thus, when He was still in the flesh, even though His humanity was sinless and perfect, it was not yet the Son of God. This part needed to pass through death and resurrection to be designated the Son of God by the mighty power of resurrection. This is the process of being &ldquo;sonized&rdquo;; the perfectly sinless humanity of Christ was uplifted to the level of divinity through resurrection. Thus, this Christ who is the seed of David in His humanity became the Son of God, even in His humanity, through resurrection, to be the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity (v. 29).</p>
<p>The prophecy in 2 Samuel 7:14 is extremely important in the eternal economy of God. The prophetic word of Nathan, which says, &ldquo;I will be his Father, and he will be My son,&rdquo; was not merely fulfilled in Christ. It further unveils a more important matter, which is that a seed of man&mdash;a son of man&mdash;can become the Son of God. This implies that God&rsquo;s intention is to make Himself man in order to make man God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. This is the ultimate goal that Christ has accomplished and attained as the seed of David in His humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being a Branch of Jesse, the Shoot of David</h2>
<p>Other prophets in the Old Testament, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah, also prophesied concerning the humanity of Christ. Isaiah 11:1-2 says, &ldquo;Then a sprout will come forth from the stump of Jesse, / And a branch from his roots will bear fruit. / And the Spirit of Jehovah will rest upon Him, / The Spirit of wisdom and understanding, / The Spirit of counsel and might, / The Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah.&rdquo; Jeremiah 23:5-6 and 33:15 both say that Jehovah would raise up for the house of David &ldquo;a righteous Shoot,&rdquo; who would reign as King and act prudently and execute justice and righteousness in the land. His name would be called &ldquo;Jehovah our righteousness&rdquo; (v. 16). The prophet Zechariah also mentioned that Jehovah promised He would bring forth David&rsquo;s shoot (Zech. 3:8). These prophecies indicate that Christ in His humanity is a branch of Jesse, the Shoot of David.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being the Sprout out of the Stump of Jesse,<br />
the Shoot of David</h2>
<p>Isaiah prophesied that Christ in His humanity would be a sprout that came forth from the stump of Jesse&mdash;the last part of a cut trunk close to the roots (Isa. 11:1a). The royal family of David had been cut to the bottom. The whole trunk of David&rsquo;s family had been cut close to the roots, leaving only a sprout from the stump. Christ was born out of the family of David as a sprout that grew into a new branch, the branch of Jesse.</p>
<p>Jeremiah and Zechariah prophesied that Christ in His humanity is the Shoot of David. A shoot is the sprout of a tree, especially a sprout of a tree that has been cut down. The royal house of David was like a great and flourishing tree, but because of the degradation of Solomon and the apostasy of his descendants, the tree was cut down, mainly by Nebuchadnezzar, leaving only a stump in the earth. Nevertheless, Christ in His humanity is the sprout growing out from that stump (Isa. 53:2), to become the Shoot of David. Hence, the birth of Christ is the Shoot of David&mdash;the fresh sprout&mdash;growing from the stump of the tree.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Spirit of Jehovah Resting on Him</h2>
<p>Isaiah prophesied that the Spirit of Jehovah&mdash;the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah&mdash;would rest upon Christ (11:2). Christ in His human living, as the branch of Jesse in His humanity, had all these attributes. He was full of the Spirit of wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah. When He returns, in His humanity He will be given the authority to execute judgment in righteousness over the earth and make all the creatures of God live in peaceful harmony (vv. 3-9).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. His Name Being Jehovah Our Righteousness</h2>
<p>In his prophecy the prophet Jeremiah said that Christ, the Shoot of David, is called &ldquo;Jehovah our righteousness&rdquo; (Jer. 23:6). This indicates that Christ in His humanity, as the Shoot of David, is not merely a man; He is Jehovah becoming our righteousness. At Jeremiah&rsquo;s time there was no righteousness among the Israelites. But Jeremiah prophesied that Christ would come as a Shoot who is Jehovah Himself to be the righteousness of God&rsquo;s chosen people. Paul refers to the fulfillment of this in 1 Corinthians 1:30 where he says, &ldquo;Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; The people of God do not have righteousness in themselves (Psa. 14:1-3; 53:1-3; Rom 3:10); &ldquo;our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment&rdquo; (Isa. 64:6). But we have this Christ, the Shoot of David, who is called Jehovah our righteousness. He is God Himself who died on the cross as a man to accomplish redemption for us by shedding His blood. Based on this redemption, we can receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness; God makes Christ our righteousness and clothes us with the robe of righteousness (61:10) so that we may be justified before God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals and testifies that Christ in His Godhead is God, and in His humanity He is man. There are also prophecies concerning these two aspects in the Old Testament. The prophecies concerning the divinity of Christ in the Old Testament mainly say that Christ is the eternal Creator, that His goings forth are from ancient times, that He is God, even the Mighty God, and that He is the eternal Father. The prophecies concerning the humanity of Christ are typified mainly in relation to four persons: the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, the seed of David, and a branch of Jesse, the Shoot of David.</p>
<p>In the aspect of divinity, the Old Testament prophesies that Christ is the Creator who is eternally unchanging and whose years are without end. Christ is the Creator who existed even before creation. He remains forever and ever, from eternity past to eternity future. The prophet Micah prophesied that Christ is from the ancient time and from the days of eternity. This means that Christ existed in eternity, before the creation of all things. This is also a prophecy related to Christ&rsquo;s deity. The Psalms prophesy that Christ is God Himself, that in His divinity He has the eternal throne, and that the scepter of His kingdom is upright. This Christ who is God with all the riches of His divinity has become &ldquo;so great a salvation&rdquo; to the believers. Isaiah prophesied that He is the Mighty God and the Eternal Father. The Christ who was born as a baby is the Son given to us by God, and this Christ the Son is the eternal Father. The baby born in the manger in Bethlehem was the gift given by God to us, and this gift is His Son, who is the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Eternal Father, and the Prince of Peace. When we receive this Christ, we receive God and enjoy all His riches.</p>
<p>Concerning the aspect of His humanity, the Old Testament first prophesied that Christ is the seed of the woman; this is the first prophecy in the entire Bible. Jesus Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary, thus fulfilling the prophecy of Christ being the seed of the woman in His humanity. As the seed of the woman, Christ in His humanity is God with us. By His death on the cross, He bruised the head of the ancient serpent, Satan. Christ in His humanity is also the seed of Abraham as typified by Isaac, who came out of Abraham and received the inheritance. Christ in His humanity blesses the nations so that the nations may receive the gospel of Christ, which is to receive the Spirit promised by God. He is also the seed of David, who builds the temple of God in His resurrected humanity and whose humanity in resurrection was designated the Son of God as the firstborn Son of God. This implies that God&rsquo;s intention is to make Himself man in order to make man God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. This is the ultimate goal that Christ has accomplished and attained as the seed of David in His humanity. The Old Testament further prophesied that Christ is a branch of Jesse, the Shoot of David. The Spirit of Jehovah rested upon Him, and He was full of the Spirit of wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah. His name is called Jehovah our righteousness. The people of God do not have righteousness, but Christ is Jehovah our righteousness that we may be justified before God.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>We have seen that before Christ was incarnated, the Old Testament prophets prophesied that the incarnated Christ is God and also man. In this lesson and in the next we will see what the Old Testament prophets prophesied concerning Christ&rsquo;s first coming.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus appeared to the disciples after His resurrection, He said, &ldquo;All the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled&rdquo; (Luke 24:44). The Lord&rsquo;s speaking here unveils that there are prophecies concerning Him in the Old Testament and that He is the fulfillment of these prophecies. God revealed the first coming of Christ to all His children through the prophecies in the Old Testament. Psalm 40:6-8 is referred to in Hebrews 10:5-7, which speaks of Christ coming into the world, saying, &ldquo;Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me. In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You did not delight. Then I said, Behold, I have come (in the roll of the book it is written concerning Me) to do Your will, O God.&rdquo; This shows that the Old Testament clearly prophesied the first coming of Christ and that the incarnation of Christ was His coming to do the will of God.</p>
<p>The Old Testament prophets not only prophesied concerning the first coming of Christ; they also prophesied concerning many aspects of His person and work in His first coming. These aspects include Christ as Shiloh; a Star; a Prophet; the One who does God&rsquo;s will; a great light and a light of the nations; a child, a Son (Emmanuel); the King; the One coming forth from Bethlehem; the Desire of the nations; a Messenger of God and the Angel of the covenant; and the glory and consolation of Israel. In this lesson we will first see Christ in His first coming as Shiloh, a Star, a Prophet, the One who does God&rsquo;s will, a great light and a light of the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. SHILOH</h2>
<p>Genesis 49:10 says, &ldquo;The scepter will not depart from Judah, / Nor the ruler&rsquo;s staff from between his feet, / Until Shiloh comes, / And to Him shall be the obedience of the peoples.&rdquo; The scepter denotes authority and signifies the royal, kingly authority. The word <em>staff</em> is a synonym of <em>scepter,</em> and refers to the staff of a ruler. <em>Shiloh</em> means &ldquo;arbitrator, peace bringer.&rdquo; This verse prophesies that Christ in His first coming is Shiloh, the Arbitrator and the Peace bringer. The proper kingdom and ruling that Christ brings in is a realm of peace. Ephesians 2 reveals that Christ has made the Jewish and the Gentile believers one and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two, the Jews and the Gentiles, in Himself into one new man, so making peace (vv. 14-15). By His cross the enmity between the Jews and Gentiles was slain so that the two were reconciled to God in one Body (v. 16). Thus, Ephesians 2:14-16 is the fulfillment of Genesis 49:10 regarding Christ being the coming Shiloh. Christ in His first coming as Shiloh not only created peace between men but also rectified the condition between God and man. Since we have Christ as Shiloh, we can enjoy true reconciliation and peace. This prophecy will be fully accomplished at the time of Christ&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. A STAR OUT OF JACOB</h2>
<p>In Numbers 24:17 the Gentile prophet Balaam also prophesied concerning the first coming of Christ, saying, &ldquo;I see Him, but not now; / I behold Him, but not near. / There shall come forth a Star out of Jacob.&rdquo; This Star refers to Christ, who was manifested to the people as a star in His first coming. The fulfillment of Christ as a Star out of Jacob is found in Matthew 2:2, where the magi from the east said, &ldquo;Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star at its rising and have come to worship Him.&rdquo; The magi did not say, &ldquo;We have seen <em>a</em> star,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We have seen <em>the</em> star,&rdquo; but &ldquo;We have seen <em>His</em> star.&rdquo; The magi saw the living star of Christ and received a living vision concerning Him. Eventually, the star led them to the place where Christ was (v. 9). This is definitely the fulfillment of Numbers 24:17.</p><h2 class="head1">III. A PROPHET RAISED UP BY GOD</h2>
<p>The Old Testament prophet Moses prophesied that Christ would come as a Prophet raised up by God (Deut. 18:15-19). In verse 15 Moses said to the children of Israel, &ldquo;A Prophet will Jehovah your God raise up for you from your midst.&rdquo; Moses indicated that God would give Him, the Prophet, the words that He ought to speak and that He would speak to God&rsquo;s people all that God commanded Him. In Acts 3:22-23 Peter quotes Moses&rsquo; words to indicate that Christ is the Prophet promised by God through Moses to His people. Thus, the fulfillment of this prophecy was confirmed in Acts 3:22-23. Moses said that this Prophet would be raised up &ldquo;from your midst.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ as the coming Prophet would be human as well as divine. He is God incarnated to be a man, the God-man. If Christ were merely God, He could not have been raised up from among the Israelites. However, as the incarnated God, Christ put on human nature and became a Jew. Thus, He is the Prophet raised up &ldquo;from your midst,&rdquo; as prophesied by Moses. Christ in His first coming was the Prophet raised up by God. He spoke the word of God (John 1:14; 3:34; 7:16-17; Heb. 1:2) and prophesied many things concerning God&rsquo;s economy, especially concerning the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy. Christ was indeed a great Prophet in His first coming.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE ONE WHO DOES GOD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>In Psalm 40:6-8 David prophesied that Christ in His first coming was to do the will of God: &ldquo;You do not delight in sacrifice and offering; / You have prepared ears for Me; / You do not require burnt offering and sin offering. / Then I said, / Behold, I have come; / In the scroll of the book / It is written concerning Me. / I delight in doing Your will, O My God; / Indeed Your law is within My inward parts.&rdquo; This prophecy is one of the greatest revelations concerning the commission of Christ in His incarnation. In Hebrews 10 Paul points out that in this portion of the Word Christ Himself prophesies that He would do God&rsquo;s will to replace the Old Testament sacrifices and offerings (vv. 5-10).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament economy God commanded His people to offer to Him sacrifices (for sin and sins) and offerings (for fellowship). But when Jesus came, God no longer delighted in the Old Testament sacrifices and offerings. Instead, God&rsquo;s will was to replace the sacrifices and offerings with Christ. Christ is the real sacrifice and offering; He is the reality of all the sacrifices and offerings. Psalm 40:6 says, &ldquo;You have prepared ears for Me.&rdquo; <em>Prepared ears for Me</em> is literally &ldquo;bored My ears.&rdquo; The boring of the slave&rsquo;s ears indicates that the master required the slave&rsquo;s obedience (cf. Exo. 21:6). The obedience of Christ was for Him to be &ldquo;obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross&rdquo; (Phil. 2:8). The obedience that God required of Christ was for Him to do the will of God by being the sacrifice and offering in His crucifixion in the body of His flesh (Col. 1:22). Hence, in Hebrews 10 Paul quotes the psalm according to the Septuagint: &ldquo;a body You have prepared for Me&rdquo; (v. 5). To bore the ears was for Christ&rsquo;s obedience to die on the cross, and to prepare a body was also for His dying on the cross. Thus, according to this prophecy, in His first coming through incarnation, Christ was to be the sacrifice and offering established by God on the cross. He knew that God&rsquo;s delight was no longer in the sacrifices and offerings of the old covenant and that He would be their replacement. Therefore, He said to God, &ldquo;Behold, I have come / ...I delight in doing Your will&rdquo; (Psa. 40:7-8). As the One who does God&rsquo;s will, Christ fulfills and replaces all the sacrifices and offerings of the Old Testament. This is to terminate God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy and to initiate and enact God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (Matt. 26:26-28).</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. A GREAT LIGHT AND A LIGHT OF THE NATIONS</h2>
<p>Isaiah 9:1-2 says, &ldquo;Gloom does not remain in the place where there was anguish: formerly He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali contemptibly, but afterward He treats the way of the sea, across the Jordan, with glory, Galilee of the nations. The people who walked in the darkness / Have seen a great light; / Upon those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death / Light has shined.&rdquo; This is a prophecy concerning Christ in His first coming as a great light. Matthew 4 speaks of the fulfillment of Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy. When Christ left Jerusalem and came to Galilee, the people sitting in darkness saw a great light (v. 16). John the Baptist was a lamp that was burning and shining (John 5:35), but Christ was a great light. Even though at His birth Christ was a star, in His ministry He was a great light. He said, &ldquo;I have come as a light into the world, that everyone who believes into Me would not remain in darkness&rdquo; (12:46). This light is the light of life that shines in the darkness (8:12b), manifesting God as light (12:46; Heb. 1:3a) so that by believing into the light, men can become sons of light (John 12:36).</p>
<p>In Isaiah 9:1-2 the prophet Isaiah unveils Christ as the great light in a very beautiful and poetic way. Gloom, anguish, and contempt were in the land of Zebulun and of Naphtali&mdash;Galilee of the nations&mdash;because darkness was there. However, when the people who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death and walked in darkness met Christ, they saw the great light. This light shines upon those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide their feet into the way of peace (Luke 1:78-79). Furthermore, Christ in His first coming as the great light was also for the release of people from their bondage. Isaiah 9:3 says, &ldquo;You have multiplied the nation; / You have increased their gladness; / They are glad before You as with the gladness of harvest, / As men rejoice when they divide the spoil.&rdquo; This prophecy refers to the increase, spread, and growth of Christ on earth. It was fulfilled in the early apostles, such as Peter, John, and James, and it is also related to us. We are the farmers in the harvest and the fighters dividing the spoil. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;For You break the yoke of their burden / And the staff on their shoulder, / The rod of their oppressor.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ as the great light breaks the yoke of the burden of the people of God so that they are released and their joy is increased.</p>
<p>Besides these points, in Isaiah 49:6 the prophet prophesied that God would send His servant, Christ, to be a light of the nations: &ldquo;I will also set You as a light of the nations / That You may be My salvation unto the ends of the earth&rdquo; (cf. 42:6). This prophecy was fulfilled in Luke 2 when Joseph and Mary entered into the temple with the little child Jesus, and Simeon received Him into his arms and blessed God, saying, &ldquo;My eyes have seen Your salvation, which You have prepared before the face of all the peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of Your people Israel&rdquo; (vv. 30-32). Christ is the light of life, the true light, to shine over the world and enlighten every man (John 1:4, 9; 8:12; 9:5). He is the divine, marvelous light to deliver the believers out of the darkness of death, the death-realm, into God&rsquo;s life-realm of light (1 Pet. 2:9b; Acts 26:18a).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>When the Lord appeared to the disciples after His resurrection, He said, &ldquo;All the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled&rdquo; (Luke 24:44). This word unveils that God prophesied in the Old Testament concerning the first coming of Christ. Furthermore, the Old Testament prophesies concerning many aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person and work in His first coming.</p>
<p>Christ in His first coming is Shiloh; He is the Arbitrator and Peace bringer. He not only created peace between men but also rectified the condition between God and us. Since we have Christ as Shiloh, we can enjoy true reconciliation and peace. Numbers 24:17 is a prophecy concerning Christ as a Star. In His first coming Christ was manifested as a star. The Old Testament prophet Moses prophesied that Christ would come as a Prophet raised up by God from among the Israelites. This indicates that Christ as the coming Prophet would be human as well as divine. He is God incarnated to be a man, the God-man. He is the Prophet raised up by God to speak the word of God and prophesy many things concerning God&rsquo;s economy. Psalm 40:6-8 prophesies that in His first coming, Christ came to do the will of God. This prophecy is one of the greatest revelations concerning the commission of Christ in His incarnation. As the One who does God&rsquo;s will, Christ fulfills and replaces all the sacrifices and offerings of the Old Testament. This is to terminate God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy and to initiate and enact God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Isaiah 9:1-2 prophesies that Christ in His first coming is a great light. He shines upon those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide their feet into the way of peace. Christ as a great light also breaks the yoke of the burden of God&rsquo;s people so that they are released and their joy is increased. He is also the light of the nations; He is the light of life, the true light, to deliver the believers out of the darkness of death, the death-realm, into God&rsquo;s life-realm of light.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue from the previous lesson to see Christ in His first coming as prophesied by the Old Testament prophets. He is the child, the Son (Emmanuel); the King; the One coming forth from Bethlehem; the Desire of all the nations; and the Messenger of God and the Angel of the covenant. We will also see that at the birth of Jesus the aged Simeon prophesied that Christ would be the glory and consolation of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE CHILD BORN OF A VIRGIN,<br />
THE SON (EMMANUEL)<br />
GIVEN BY THE ETERNAL FATHER</h2>
<p>Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6 are two of the greatest prophecies in the Bible concerning Christ. These prophecies speak of a child being born and a Son being given. The word <em>child</em> in these verses implies God, man, God becoming a man, and God and man mingled as one. Such a child was a God-man. This child born of the human nature by a human virgin was also the Son given in the divine nature by the Eternal Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. A Child Born of a Human Virgin</h2>
<p>This divine-human child was begotten in the virgin Mary of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:20). The divine essence of the Holy Spirit was generated in Mary&rsquo;s womb before the child Jesus was delivered out of her womb. God was born into Mary and remained in Mary&rsquo;s womb for nine months. Then the One who was of the Holy Spirit in Mary was delivered out of her womb as a God-man with both divinity and humanity (v. 23). This God-man was named Jesus&mdash;Jehovah the Savior&mdash;by God (v. 21). Jesus is not only a man but also Jehovah. Furthermore, He is not only Jehovah; He is Jehovah becoming our salvation. Hence, He is our Savior. He was called Emmanuel&mdash;God with us&mdash;by the ones who experienced Him (v. 23b). The child born of Mary was a God-man child. Before His birth, there had never been such a human being, a man mingled with God. This God-man is Emmanuel. He is God coming from divinity and with divinity into humanity to be Jehovah the Savior. On the negative side, He saves us from sin, and on the positive side, He saves us to God. He brings us unto God from a fallen situation, a situation of having our back turned to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Son Given by the Eternal Father</h2>
<p>The child born of a human virgin is the Son given by the Eternal Father (Isa. 9:6a; John 3:16). The prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 concerning Emmanuel sees its fulfillment in Matthew 1:20-23. The prophecy in Isaiah 9:6 concerning Christ as the Wonderful One sees its fulfillment in John 3:16. Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us.&rdquo; John 3:16 says, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.&rdquo; Therefore, John 3:16 is based upon Isaiah 9:6. The Son was given by a child being born. In the birth of this child there was a gift given by God&mdash;His Son, the One who became the God-man. His Son, the gift given to us, is also the Mighty God and the Eternal Father. This clearly reveals that the child born of a virgin is also the Son given by the Eternal Father; and this Son is the Mighty God and the Eternal Father. The Gospel of John also contains the same revelation. John 1:1 and 14 say that He was the Word, the very God, who became flesh. He was the Word, and then He became flesh. His becoming flesh was His coming with the fullness of grace and reality. His becoming flesh was God&rsquo;s incarnation. Thus, the Son became God&rsquo;s embodiment (Col. 2:9). By bringing us grace and reality, He becomes our portion and our reality so that we can receive and gain Him.</p>
<p>The child born of the virgin is Jesus, whom man called Emmanuel, and this child is also the Son, as the gift to us from God. This Son, this gift, is the Mighty God and the Eternal Father. When we received Christ, we received Him as so many marvelous items. He is Jehovah our Savior to save us from sin into Himself, and He is Emmanuel, God with us. We enjoy this One as grace, which is God Himself as our portion for our enjoyment. The issue of our enjoyment of Him as our portion is that He becomes our reality. What a blessing this is!</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE KING</h2>
<p>Isaiah 32:1-2 says, &ldquo;Indeed a King will reign according to righteousness, / And the rulers will rule according to justice. / And a man will be like a refuge from the wind / And a covering from the tempest, / Like streams of water in a dry place, / Like the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land.&rdquo; Here Isaiah prophesies that Christ in His first coming would be a King as well as a man for supplying, caring, and covering His people. The Gospel of Matthew reveals that Christ is the King, as prophesied in the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of God to earth. He is not only God but also a man. He is very human and even lowly in order to take care of all the needs of His people.</p>
<p>This man who is the King, Christ, is a refuge to us from the wind. When we face a storm, we can hide in Him to receive His protection. He is also a covering from the tempest. A tempest is much stronger, more troublesome, and much harder to face than wind. When we are facing a tempest, Christ covers us so that the tempest cannot bother or damage us. This God-man is also streams of water in a dry place to supply, comfort, and satisfy us so that we can be watered in a dry place. Christ is also the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land. <em>A wasted land</em> signifies a place damaged and wasted by man. This wonderful Christ is the shadow of a massive rock that becomes a sheltering shade as our covering. These items are various aspects of the care and supply rendered to us, the kingdom people, by Christ as the King in His kingship. The prophecy of Isaiah concerning Christ as the King has been fulfilled in Christ&rsquo;s first coming. Ultimately, at Christ&rsquo;s second coming, this prophecy will be consummately fulfilled. At that time, in the millennial kingdom, Christ will be the King to bring in the restoration of Israel.</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. THE ONE COMING FORTH FROM BETHLEHEM</h2>
<p>Concerning Christ&rsquo;s first coming, the prophet Micah prophesied, &ldquo;You, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, / So little to be among the thousands of Judah, / From you there will come forth to Me / He who is to be Ruler in Israel; / And His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity&rdquo; (5:2). Based on Matthew 2:6, the birth of Jesus has fully fulfilled this prophecy. Micah&rsquo;s prophecy concerning the goings forth of Christ is a great matter in God&rsquo;s economy. This prophecy reveals to us that on the one hand, Christ as a man came out of Bethlehem, &ldquo;David&rsquo;s city&rdquo; (Luke 2:4), but on the other hand, Christ as God came forth from the days of eternity.</p>
<p>In eternity past God chose us and predestinated us in Christ (Eph. 1:4-5). Through Christ&rsquo;s coming forth, God&rsquo;s choosing and predestinating were manifested in the believers. If God had only selected and predestinated us in eternity without coming forth out of eternity, that is, coming with His divinity into humanity, He could do nothing with us. Whatever He will do and can do for us depends on His coming forth. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, that is, His becoming the One who comes forth from Bethlehem, started from ancient times, from the days of eternity. Not only did He come forth from ancient times and from the days of eternity, but He was also incarnated and went through human living, death, resurrection, and ascension to become the consummated Spirit. In His goings forth, He is our Ruler, Shepherd, and peace (Micah 5:2-5). As our Ruler, He keeps us; as our Shepherd, He nourishes and cherishes us; and as our peace, He controls our environment so that we may enjoy Him. The prophecy in Micah concerning Christ as the One coming forth from Bethlehem, becoming the Ruler, Shepherd, and peace, will be further fulfilled at the time of the restoration. At that time Christ will save the Israelites from the invasion of the nations so that Israel, His elect, will receive comfort and enjoyment (vv. 4-6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. THE DESIRE OF ALL THE NATIONS</h2>
<p>In Haggai 2:6-7 the prophet Haggai was charged by Jehovah to speak to the people: &ldquo;Thus says Jehovah of hosts,... I will shake all the nations, and the Desire of all the nations will come.&rdquo; This prophecy was initially fulfilled at Christ&rsquo;s first coming, but it will not be until the second coming of Christ that this prophecy is completely fulfilled. This prophecy says that Christ is the Desire of all mankind. All people desire to have life, light, peace, goodness, and righteousness, but what they actually desire is Christ, because without Christ, there is no reality to these human virtues. Thus, to desire virtue is to desire Christ. All the nations, including the unbelievers, unconsciously desire Christ. This is what it means to say that Christ is the Desire of all the nations as prophesied by the prophet Haggai.</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. THE MESSENGER OF GOD<br />
AND THE ANGEL OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<p>Malachi 3:1 says, &ldquo;I am about to send My messenger, and he will clear the way before Me; and suddenly the Lord, whom you seek, will come to His temple. And the Angel of the covenant, whom you desire, He will come, says Jehovah of hosts.&rdquo; This is a prophecy concerning Christ as the Messenger of God and the Angel of the covenant in His first coming. As the Messenger of God, Christ not only brings a word or a message from God to God&rsquo;s people; He Himself is the living message. This is fully proved by the four Gospels, which are a complete and perfect record of Christ as the living message sent by God to His chosen people. While the Lord Jesus was living on earth, as He traveled through the cities, proclaiming God to the people and ministering Himself into them, He Himself was the message.</p>
<p>Christ was also the Angel of the covenant in His first coming. Before going to the cross, He established His table and enacted the new covenant with His blood (Matt. 26:26-30; Luke 22:20). For Him to be the Angel of the covenant means that He is a serving One, to serve God in forming the new testament. By the enacting of the new covenant, God is obligated to dispense Himself into our being to be our life, to be the law of life (Jer. 31:31-34), and to be everything to us. Christ not only enacted the new covenant through His death, but in resurrection He executes the new covenant as its surety (Heb. 7:22), making it real to us. By the new covenant that He enacted and by His being the surety, we have forgiveness of sins, and we also gain Him as our life and life supply. According to Acts 26 we receive forgiveness of sins and &ldquo;an inheritance among those who have been sanctified&rdquo; (v. 18b). This inheritance is the Triune God embodied in the all-inclusive Christ, to be &ldquo;the allotted portion of the saints&rdquo; as our inheritance (Col. 1:12).</p>
<p>Even though the Angel of the covenant has been sought and desired by the Israelites (Mal. 3:1; Hag. 2:7a), the Jewish people, generally speaking, have not benefited from the covenant. Instead, the covenant has gone to the Gentiles. However, when Christ comes back, He will come as the Angel of the covenant to execute His covenant over the repentant and believing Jews. At that time they will all become beneficiaries of the new covenant. The prophecy concerning Christ as the Angel of the covenant in Malachi 3 has been initially fulfilled at the first coming of Christ, and its fulfillment will be complete at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p><h2 class="head1">XI. THE GLORY AND CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>Luke 2:25 says that the righteous and devout Simeon was looking for the consolation of Israel. Not long after the birth of Jesus, when He was presented to God in the temple at Jerusalem, Simeon, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, extolled Him, not only as the light of the Gentiles but also as the glory of God&rsquo;s people, Israel (v. 32). In the Old Testament Jehovah is the glory of Israel (Jer. 2:11). In Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, He was extolled by a Spirit-inspired man as the prophesied One. This indicates that the newborn Jesus, as the very Jehovah God, was expressed among the Israelites to be their glory. He is not only the glory of Israel outwardly; He is also their consolation inwardly. Without Him, God&rsquo;s chosen people do not have outward glory or inward consolation. In the arrangement of God&rsquo;s economy, the incarnated Christ in His first coming is the glory of Israel to uplift them, and He is their consolation that comforts them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6 are two of the greatest prophecies in the Bible concerning Christ. These prophecies speak of a child being born to us and a Son being given to us. This child of both divine and human natures born of a human virgin was also a Son given in the divine nature by the Eternal Father.</p>
<p>The child born of the virgin is Jesus, whom man called Emmanuel, and this child is also the Son, as the gift to us from God. This Son, this gift, is the Mighty God and the Eternal Father. When we received Christ, we received Him as so many marvelous items. He is Jehovah our Savior to save us from sins into Himself, and He is Emmanuel, God with us. We enjoy this One as grace, which is God Himself becoming our portion for our enjoyment, and the issue is that He becomes our reality.</p>
<p>Isaiah 32:1-2 prophesies that Christ in His first coming would be a King as well as a man, coming to be among men in a lowly way to be a refuge to us from the wind and a covering from the tempest. He is like streams of water in a dry place to supply, comfort, and satisfy us so that we can be watered in a dry place. He is also like the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land to be our covering. His first coming was prophesied by the prophet Micah. Micah prophesied that, on the one hand, Christ would come out of &ldquo;David&rsquo;s city&rdquo; and, on the other hand, He would come forth from the days of eternity. Haggai prophesied that Christ, in His first coming, would be the Desire of all the nations. All people desire to have life, light, peace, goodness, and righteousness. The reality of all these human virtues is Christ.</p>
<p>Malachi 3:1 prophesies that Christ in His first coming is the Messenger of God and the Angel of the covenant. As the Messenger of God, Christ not only brings a word or a message from God to God&rsquo;s people; He Himself is the living message. He is also the Angel of the covenant, who enacted the new covenant with His blood before going to the cross. In the new covenant God is obligated to dispense Himself into our being to be our life, to be the law of life, and to be everything to us. Furthermore, He executes the new covenant in resurrection as its surety, making it real to us. Luke 2:25 says that the righteous and devout Simeon extolled Christ in prophecy as not only the glory of Israel outwardly but also their consolation inwardly. The incarnated Christ in His first coming is the  glory of Israel to uplift them, and He is also their consolation that comforts them.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the previous lessons we saw that the Old Testament prophesied that Christ is both God and man. In His first coming, Christ was God becoming man to enter into mankind with all His riches and to bring God into man in His ministry. For this divine dispensing He needed to be born and to grow up as an ordinary man and to begin His ministry through the recommendation of John the Baptist. Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty all these matters were recorded in the books of prophecy in the Old Testament long before Christ was born. In this lesson we will consider the prophecies concerning Christ&rsquo;s birth, His youth, and the recommender of His ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. CHRIST&rsquo;S BIRTH AND YOUTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Born in Bethlehem to Be a Ruler</h2>
<p>In the previous lesson we saw that the prophet Micah, in his prophecy concerning Christ&rsquo;s birth, said, &ldquo;You, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, / So little to be among the thousands of Judah, / From you there will come forth to Me / He who is to be Ruler in Israel&rdquo; (Micah 5:2). Furthermore, Jeremiah 23:5 is a prophecy concerning Christ as a righteous Shoot raised up by God out of David who would reign as King. These prophecies tell us that, on the one hand, Christ would be born in Bethlehem and, on the other hand, Christ would be the seed of David to reign in the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Born as the Seed of David,<br />
Qualified to Reign as King</h2>
<p>In order to fulfill the prophecies in Micah 5 and Jeremiah 23, Christ had to be born of the royal house and in Bethlehem. According to the genealogy of Christ in Matthew, Mary&rsquo;s husband, Joseph, was a descendant of Zerubbabel who returned from captivity (1:13-16). Zerubbabel was a leader of the tribe of Judah and a descendant of Solomon, the son of David. He led the captured Israelites in their return to Jerusalem from Babylon to rebuild the temple (Ezra 2:1-2; 3:8; 5:2). Mary, the wife of Joseph, was also a descendant of the returned captives, but she was the descendant of Nathan, another son of David (Luke 3:23-31). Luke 3:23 says, &ldquo;So it was thought, the son of Joseph, the son of Heli.&rdquo; <em>So it was thought</em> literally means &ldquo;according to law,&rdquo; indicating that Joseph was not the son of Heli in the flesh but was reckoned as the son of Heli according to law. This means that Joseph was the son-in-law of Heli, because Mary was Heli&rsquo;s daughter. Heli was a descendant of Nathan, who was also a descendant of David. Thus, both Joseph and Mary were descendants of David: Joseph was of the line of Solomon, and Mary was of the line of Nathan. According to the record of Jeremiah, no descendant of Solomon&rsquo;s son Jeconiah (Jehoiachin) was qualified to inherit the throne of David (22:28, 30). Although Jeremiah prophesied that all the descendants of Jeconiah were excluded from the throne of David, he also prophesied that God would raise up a Shoot (branch) to David, and this Shoot would be King. This prophecy of Jeremiah indicates that Christ must be the descendant of David, but He could not be a descendant of Jeconiah. The birth of Christ truly fulfilled these prophecies. He came out of Mary, a descendant of David, and not out of Joseph. Even though He was a descendant of David, He was not of the line of Jeconiah, who was cursed according to Jeremiah. Thus, He can still sit on the throne of David&rsquo;s house because He is fully qualified to reign as King.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Born in Bethlehem</h2>
<p>By the sovereignty of God, the forefathers of both Joseph and Mary returned from the land of captivity. Before the birth of Christ, Joseph and Mary did not live in Bethlehem but in Nazareth of Galilee (Luke 1:26). When Mary was in Nazareth, she was already engaged to Joseph (v. 27). Before they came together, Mary was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18; Luke 1:31-35). During her pregnancy, Caesar Augustus issued the decree for a census to be taken of all the inhabited earth. Hence, all the people went to be registered, each to his own city (2:1, 3). Since Joseph was of the house and family of David, he went with Mary to Bethlehem, David&rsquo;s city. At that time Mary was already heavy with child. While they were there, Mary&rsquo;s days were fulfilled for her to bear, and she bore Jesus (vv. 4-7a). Under God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement, the birth of Jesus precisely fulfilled the prophecies of the prophets Micah and Jeremiah concerning His birth in Bethlehem and His being a descendant of David.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Called out of Egypt</h2>
<p>Soon after Jesus was born, magi from the east went to Jerusalem, seeking to worship Him. When King Herod heard of this, he was troubled. He inquired of the birth place of Jesus and then secretly called the magi to determine accurately from them the time that the star appeared in order to destroy Him (Matt. 2:1-8). But an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, &ldquo;Arise, take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you.&rdquo; Joseph arose and took the child and His mother by night and departed into Egypt. They stayed there until Herod died (vv. 13-15). This fulfilled the prophecy of the prophet Hosea: &ldquo;When Israel was a child, I loved him, / And out of Egypt I called My son&rdquo; (11:1).</p>
<p>Hosea&rsquo;s prophecy not only explains the fact that Joseph took Mary and Jesus and fled into Egypt. It further reveals that in Christ&rsquo;s first coming He was in union with Israel as the Son of God by fleeing to Egypt and by being called out of Egypt. In the matter of being the Son of God, Christ was joined to the Israelites. Although Israel became exceedingly evil, Christ still became organically one with them through incarnation to be a real Israelite.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Growing Up in Nazareth of Galilee</h2>
<p>After the death of King Herod, who sought the life of Jesus, Joseph and Mary took Jesus and returned to Galilee, settling in Nazareth. This was &ldquo;so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene&rdquo; (Matt. 2:23). The word <em>prophets,</em> in plural, indicates that this is not a particular prophecy but a summary of the significance of several prophecies. The title <em>Nazarene</em> may refer to the branch in Isaiah 11:1, which in Hebrew is <em>netzer</em>. The branch there, signifying Christ, is a sprout out of the stump of Jesse, the father of David.</p>
<p>By the time Jesus was born, the throne of David had been overthrown. This means that the royal stem of David had been cut off. Now a new sprout came forth from the stump of Jesse and grew out of his roots. This sprouting and growing were in a situation of humiliation. Jesus was not born in a recognized and honored royal home, nor did He grow up in a renowned city such as Jerusalem. Rather, He was born in a poor home and grew up in a despised town. All this made Him a Nazarene, a branch&mdash;not a lofty branch of a stately tree, but a seemingly insignificant sprout from the stump of Jesse. Although Jesus was a Nazarene, within Him was the Spirit of God, the glory of God. As the prophet Isaiah prophesied, &ldquo;Then a sprout will come forth from the stump of Jesse, / And a branch from his roots will bear fruit. / And the Spirit of Jehovah will rest upon Him, / The Spirit of wisdom and understanding, / The Spirit of counsel and might, / The Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah&rdquo; (Isa. 11:1-2). <em>The Spirit of counsel and might</em> here equals the wisdom and power in 1 Corinthians 1:24, which tells us that Christ is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom. He is the wisdom which gives counsel and the power which gives might. What a humble yet precious Savior He is!</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Growing Up Like a Tender Plant<br />
and a Root out of Dry Ground,<br />
Having No Attracting Form nor Majesty</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:2 prophesies of Christ, saying, &ldquo;He grew up like a tender plant before Him, / And like a root out of dry ground. / He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, / Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him.&rdquo; In the Bible plants often typify humanity. For Christ to grow up like a tender plant before Jehovah means that Christ grew up before Him in His humanity. In His divinity Christ has always been perfect and complete, and thus there was no need for Him to grow in His divinity. However, He needed to grow in His humanity. First, He was born as a child, and then He grew up into boyhood and eventually into manhood.</p>
<p>He grew up in humanity not only like a tender plant but also like a root out of dry ground. <em>Dry ground</em> signifies a difficult environment. Our Lord was born to a poor carpenter&rsquo;s family, became the son of a carpenter, and grew up in the city of Nazareth of the despised region of Galilee (John 1:46; Matt 13:53-57). Like a root out of dry ground, He grew up in the midst of hard circumstances. He did not have a physically attractive form nor an appearance that people would desire. Isaiah 52:14 says, &ldquo;Even as many were astonished at Him&mdash; / His visage was marred more than that of any man, / And His form more than that of the sons of men.&rdquo; The Jews thought the Messiah would be admired by people, like Moses and David, who were attractive in appearance (Acts 7:20; 1 Sam. 16:12). The Jews also thought that when the Messiah came, there would be the royal scepter, an open ceremony, and the support of the people. But they never thought the Messiah, the anointed One of God, Christ the Servant of God, would grow up in Nazareth of Galilee like a root out of dry ground. His visage and form were marred, having no attractiveness or majesty, such that He was reckoned as nearly fifty years old when He was thirty (John 8:57). This certainly astonished the Jews. Our Lord is altogether lovely, altogether beautiful, and altogether rich, but these features are not visible to the naked eyes; only spiritual eyes can see them.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE RECOMMENDER OF CHRIST&rsquo;S MINISTRY&mdash;<br />
JOHN THE BAPTIST</h2>
<p>Before Christ began His earthly ministry, the Scriptures prophesied of a recommender who would be a forerunner of His ministry. This recommender was John the Baptist. <em>John</em> is from the Hebrew <em>Johanan</em> (2 Kings 25:23; 1 Chron. 3:24; 2 Chron. 28:12), meaning &ldquo;Jehovah is gracious,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jehovah gives grace,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah the gracious Giver.&rdquo; According to Matthew 3:1-3 John the Baptist, who appeared and preached in the wilderness, was the one referred to by the prophet Isaiah, who said, &ldquo;The voice of one who cries / In the wilderness&rdquo; (Isa. 40:3). This shows that John&rsquo;s ministry of recommendation was not accidental; neither was it according to John&rsquo;s will. Rather, it was planned by God and prophesied by the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Coming Elijah</h2>
<p>Malachi 4:5-6 prophesied, &ldquo;I am about to send Elijah the prophet to you before the great and terrible day of Jehovah comes; and he will turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said clearly that John the Baptist was the coming Elijah prophesied in the Old Testament (Matt. 17:10-13). He said, &ldquo;Elijah indeed is coming and will restore all things&rdquo; (v. 11). This refers to the time of the great tribulation when Elijah will be one of the two witnesses who strengthen the people of God (Rev. 11:3-12). But the Lord Jesus also said, &ldquo;I say to you that Elijah has already come; and they did not recognize him, but did with him the things they wished&rdquo; (Matt. 17:12). This shows that the recommender of Christ&mdash;Elijah&mdash;had already come; he was John the Baptist. In Luke 1:17 the angel spoke to John&rsquo;s father Zachariah concerning John the Baptist, and said, &ldquo;It is he who will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children.&rdquo; Thus, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, who is to come&rdquo; (Matt. 11:14).</p>
<p>Concerning the prophecies in the Bible, first there is a partial fulfillment and then a complete fulfillment. Thus, in the aspect of partial fulfillment of the prophecies, Elijah had already come as John the Baptist. In the aspect of complete fulfillment of the prophecies, the complete coming of Elijah will occur during the great tribulation in the future.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Preparing the Way of the Lord<br />
and Making Straight His Paths</h2>
<p>Isaiah 40:3-4 also prophesied the recommendation of Christ&rsquo;s ministry by John the Baptist, saying, &ldquo;The voice of one who cries / In the wilderness: Make clear / The way of Jehovah; / Make straight in the desert / A highway for our God. / Every valley will be lifted up, / And every mountain and hill will be made low, / And the crooked places will become straight, / And the rough places, a broad plain.&rdquo; This was fulfilled in Matthew 3:3-6 through John the Baptist&rsquo;s ministry. To prepare the way of Jehovah is to prepare the way of the Lord Jesus, which is also to make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Practically speaking, to prepare the way of the Lord and to make straight His paths is to change people&rsquo;s minds, to turn their minds toward the Lord and make their hearts right, to cause every part and avenue of their heart to be straightened by the Lord through repentance for the kingdom of the heavens (Luke 1:16-17). The ministry of John the Baptist was to deal with man&rsquo;s heart so that it would be ready to receive the coming Christ. When John came, he commanded the people to repent (Matt. 3:2), which was the real preparing of the Lord&rsquo;s way and making straight His paths. The purpose of Christ&rsquo;s coming was to regenerate man by entering into his spirit (John 3:3, 5). However, in order to enter into a person&rsquo;s spirit, Christ must pass through his heart. Before a man is saved, there are valleys in his heart that need to be filled up, and there are mountains and hills that need to be made low. The heart of man is crooked and needs to be made straight, and it has rough places that need to be made broad. John came to preach repentance and lead people to repent. When a person repents, the way in his heart is made flat, and the path is made straight so that Christ the King can enter his spirit to regenerate him, making him a child of God and a citizen of the kingdom of God. This is the recommending ministry of John the Baptist as prophesied in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The prophet Micah prophesied that Christ would be born in Bethlehem, and Jeremiah also prophesied that Christ as the righteous Shoot of David, raised up by God to David, would reign as King. The New Testament shows that these prophecies were fulfilled by God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangements. Both Joseph and Mary were descendants of David: Joseph was of the line of Solomon, and Mary was of the line of Nathan. Jeremiah prophesied that no descendant of Solomon&rsquo;s son Jeconiah (Jehoiachin) was qualified to inherit the throne of David. However, Christ came out of Mary, a descendant of David, not out of Joseph. Thus, He can sit on the throne of David&rsquo;s house because He is fully qualified to reign as King. By the sovereignty of God, the forefathers of both Joseph and Mary returned from the land of captivity. Thus, Jesus was born in Bethlehem as a descendant of David. Soon after Jesus was born, King Herod wanted to destroy Him. But the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, telling him to take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt. This fulfilled the prophecy of the prophet Hosea. After the death of King Herod, Joseph and Mary took Jesus and returned to Galilee, settling in Nazareth. This fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets, that He would be called a Nazarene. The title <em>Nazarene</em> may refer to the branch in Isaiah 11:1, signifying that Christ is a sprout out of the stump of Jesse, the father of David. This sprouting and growing were in a situation of humiliation. Jesus was born in a poor home and grew up in a despised town. Isaiah 53 prophesied that Christ would grow before Jehovah like a tender plant and like a root out of dry ground. He had no attracting form or beautiful appearance. Our Lord did not have outward beauty, but He was full of beauty within. To those who truly know Him, He is altogether lovely.</p>
<p>Before Christ began His earthly ministry, John the Baptist was His recommender. The name <em>John</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah is gracious,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jehovah gives grace,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah is a gracious Giver.&rdquo; The recommending ministry of John the Baptist was planned by God and was prophesied by the prophet Isaiah. Malachi 4 prophesied that John would be the coming Elijah. He would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the heart of the fathers to the children. The Lord Jesus also said that John was Elijah, who was to come. The ministry of John the Baptist was mainly to deal with man&rsquo;s heart so that it would be prepared to receive the coming Christ. The purpose of Christ&rsquo;s coming was to regenerate man by entering into his spirit. John came to preach repentance and lead people to repent. When a person repents, his heart is prepared for Christ the King to enter into his spirit to regenerate him, thus making him a child of God and a citizen of the kingdom of God.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will see how the Old Testament prophets prophesied concerning Christ&rsquo;s being anointed and His living and work during the three and a half years of His ministry on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. HIS ANOINTING</h2>
<p><em>Christ</em> is the equivalent of the Hebrew word <em>Messiah,</em> which means &ldquo;the anointed.&rdquo; The earthly ministry of Christ began with His being anointed. Isaiah 61:1 prophesied concerning the anointing of Christ, the Anointed of Jehovah. This verse says, &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me, / Because Jehovah has anointed Me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Spirit of Jehovah<br />
Descending upon Him at His Baptism</h2>
<p>According to Matthew 3:16 and Luke 3:21-22, after His baptism Christ rose up from the water, and the Spirit of God descended in bodily form as a dove upon Him. This was the fulfillment of Isaiah 61:1. This prophecy was fulfilled and carried out to anoint the new King, Christ, and recommend Him to God&rsquo;s people. In His first coming the Lord was conceived of the Holy Spirit. Moreover, when the essence of the Holy Spirit was added to His humanity, He was constituted a God-man. He then lived thirty years as a man in the essence of the Holy Spirit. At the age of thirty He was ready to come forth to carry out His ministry. When He was baptized in the water, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him economically. Before that time, He was constituted with the Holy Spirit essentially. However, in order to carry out God&rsquo;s economy, He needed the Holy Spirit economically for power and authority (Acts 10:38) so that He could be the Servant of Jehovah to minister God into man. This is the significance of &ldquo;the Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Spirit of God Being upon Him Continually throughout His Living and Work</h2>
<p>According to the prophecy of Isaiah 61:1, Christ was not only anointed to have the Spirit of God upon Him; for His whole life the Spirit of God was upon Him in His living and work. At the beginning of His ministry He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted, tested, by the devil (Matt. 4:1). During His ministry He had the Spirit of God with Him; thus, when He spoke God&rsquo;s words, He could give the Spirit without measure (John 3:34). He also cast out demons by the Spirit of God and released man from the bondage of Satan (Matt. 12:28; Luke 4:18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. HIS LIVING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Toward Man</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Not Striving Nor Crying Out</h2>
<p>Isaiah 42:2 says, &ldquo;He will not cry out, nor lift up His voice, / Nor make His voice heard in the street.&rdquo; The fulfillment of this prophecy is referred to in Matthew 12:19, which says, &ldquo;He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.&rdquo; Christ in His living and work on the earth did not strive with others, nor promote Himself; He did not seek to make Himself known to people on the streets. He had no fame, and He made no name for Himself. His quietness indicated His victory, which qualified Him to be the Servant of Jehovah. His hiding was related to His breaking of religious regulations. Consequently, He was rejected by the religionists, and He was limited in His freedom to minister openly. In order to care for His headship and for the members of His Body, He had to hide Himself.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Not Breaking a Bruised Reed <br />
and Not Quenching a Smoking Flax</h2>
<p>Christ, the anointed One, was not only silent and hidden; Isaiah also prophesied that He would not break a bruised reed nor extinguish a dimly burning flax (42:3). The fulfillment of this was referred to in Matthew 12:20, which says, &ldquo;A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench.&rdquo; The Jews were accustomed to making flutes of reeds. When a reed was bruised and unable to make music, they broke it. They also made torches out of flax with oil. When the oil ran out, the torch could not produce shining light but instead would smoke; hence, they quenched it. The prophet Isaiah used bruised reeds and dimly burning flax as types to prophesy concerning the poor situation of God&rsquo;s people at the time of Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry. Despite their poor situation, Christ would not break a bruised reed nor quench a smoking flax; He kept the door of mercy and grace open to all the people. No matter how much opposition, persecution, and attack He encountered, the Servant of Jehovah, Christ, was always merciful and full of sympathy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Toward God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Trusting in God</h2>
<p>According to Psalm 18, a psalm of David, Christ trusted fully in God in His living on earth (vv. 1-2). When He was tested by the devil, He stood in the position of a man and declared, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matt. 4:4). He cast out demons by the Spirit of God (12:28). In the matter of feeding the five thousand with five loaves and two fish, He trusted in and looked to the Father; He looked up to heaven and blessed the food (14:19). Peter testified, &ldquo;Who being reviled did not revile in return; suffering, He did not threaten but kept committing all to Him who judges righteously&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:23). The Lord kept committing all His insults and injuries to Him who judges righteously in His government, the righteous God, to whom He submitted Himself. He trusted God fully in all things.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Zealous for God&rsquo;s House</h2>
<p>Psalm 69 prophesied that Christ would be devoured by the zeal for God&rsquo;s house (v. 9a). This prophecy was fulfilled at the time Christ cleansed the temple, the house of God (John 2:12-17). When the Lord saw the corrupted situation of the temple, He could not tolerate it. He made a whip out of cords and drove the people, as well as the sheep and the oxen, out of the temple. He also poured out the money of the moneychangers and overturned their tables. After the Lord cleansed the temple, &ldquo;His disciples remembered that it was written, &lsquo;The zeal of Your house shall devour Me&rsquo;&rdquo; (v. 17). Out of the zeal for God&rsquo;s house, He could not tolerate the corruption, greed, and defilement in God&rsquo;s temple. His heart for the Father was absolute and pure. Therefore, in His zeal for God, He cleansed the temple.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. In Suffering</h2>
<p>The prophets prophesied both in Psalm 69 and Isaiah 53 concerning the suffering of Christ in His earthly ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Despised, Forsaken, and <br />
Acquainted with Grief</h2>
<p>In prophesying concerning Christ&rsquo;s suffering Isaiah said, &ldquo;He was despised and forsaken of men, / A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; / And like one from whom men hide their faces, / He was despised; and we did not esteem Him&rdquo; (53:3). According to the account of the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus was continually despised and forsaken, causing Him to sorrow and be acquainted with grief. The Jews did not like to see Him, and they did not esteem or regard Him (Matt. 13:54-57). Furthermore, in spite of all the Lord&rsquo;s ministry on the earth, there was no response from the religious people. They did not receive Him. On the contrary, they rejected Him, just as it was prophesied in Isaiah 53:1: &ldquo;Who has believed our report? / And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?&rdquo; <em>The arm of Jehovah</em> is a figure of speech signifying the Lord Himself in His saving power. The Lord Jesus, the Savior Himself, is the arm of Jehovah coming to save man. But in the religious world no one knew Him as the arm of Jehovah, nor did they respond to or receive Him. On the contrary, the religionists forsook Him and even nailed Him to the cross. Christ, as the Servant of Jehovah, was full of sorrow in His human living, which fully qualified Him to be the Savior of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Hated and Reproached by Men</h2>
<p>Taking David as a type, Psalm 69 prophesied concerning Christ&rsquo;s suffering: &ldquo;More numerous than the hairs of my head / Are those who hate me without cause&rdquo; (v. 4a). The Lord Jesus quoted this verse in John 15:25, saying that He was hated by many without cause. This indicates that Christ suffered not only for our sake, but He also suffered in bearing reproaches for the sake of God. Hence, Christ was not only our Substitute bearing our problems but was also God&rsquo;s Substitute bearing God&rsquo;s problems. Paul quotes Psalm 69:9 in Romans 15:3, saying, &ldquo;The reproaches of those who reproached You fell upon Me.&rdquo; Paul quotes this verse in order to encourage the saints to receive the believers according to Christ and to bear the problems of others just as Christ bore God&rsquo;s problems.</p><h2 class="head1">III. HIS MINISTRY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Servant of Jehovah to Serve God</h2>
<p>Isaiah 42:1-4 says, &ldquo;Here is My Servant, whom I uphold, / My chosen One in whom My soul delights; / I have put My Spirit upon Him, / And He will bring forth justice to the nations. / He will not cry out, nor lift up His voice, / Nor make His voice heard in the street. / A bruised reed He will not break; / And a dimly burning flax He will not extinguish; / He will bring forth justice in truth. / He will not faint, nor will He be discouraged, / Until He has established justice in the earth; / And the coastlands will wait for His instruction.&rdquo; This prophecy speaks of what Christ was and did as the Servant of Jehovah in His ministry and service. Matthew 12:17-21 speaks of the complete fulfillment of this prophecy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Bringing Good News</h2>
<p>Isaiah 61:1 prophesied concerning Christ&rsquo;s being anointed to bring good news: &ldquo;Jehovah has anointed Me / To bring good news to the afflicted.&rdquo; This prophecy was fulfilled in Luke 4:18-19. When the Lord came to Nazareth, which was the place where He grew up, He entered into the synagogue and stood up to read the Scriptures. The scroll of Isaiah was handed to Him, and after reading Isaiah 61:1-2, He sat down and said, &ldquo;Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing&rdquo; (Luke 4:21). This indicates that Christ in His earthly ministry was to bring good news. <em>To bring good news</em> in Greek means &ldquo;to bring glad tidings,&rdquo; that is, to preach the gospel. To preach the gospel was the first commission of the anointed Lord; He preached the gospel to the poor, that is, to those who were the poor in heavenly, spiritual, and divine things (Luke 12:21; Rev. 3:17; cf. Matt. 5:3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Proclaiming the Jubilee of God</h2>
<p>Isaiah 61:2 also prophesied that Christ will &ldquo;proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah.&rdquo; This prophecy was fulfilled in Luke 4:19. Christ as the Servant of Jehovah was anointed by God to proclaim the jubilee, the acceptable year of the Lord. According to the description in Leviticus 25, the year of jubilee was the time to proclaim liberty and the return of property to the rightful owners. Hence, the year of jubilee was a time of release and freedom and a year of return of lost property. Those who had been sold into slavery were released in the year of jubilee. Thus, Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy points to the New Testament age typified by the year of jubilee (Lev. 25:8-17). In the New Testament age God accepts the returned captives of sin (Isa. 49:8; 2 Cor. 6:2), and those who are oppressed under Satan in sin or in sickness enjoy freedom (Luke 13:11-13; John 8:34), that is, the release of God&rsquo;s salvation. The anointed Christ brings in the real jubilee for God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Healing the Blind</h2>
<p>Isaiah 61:1 also prophesies that Christ would proclaim &ldquo;the opening of the eyes to those who are bound.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ in His earthly ministry would open the eyes of the blind, those who are physically and spiritually blind (Zeph. 1:17; John 9:39-41; 1 John 2:11; Rev. 3:17). While on earth Christ not only healed the physically blind (Matt. 9:27-30; 20:30-34; Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43; John 9:1-7), but He also opened the spiritual eyes so that people could know Him (vv. 30-38).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Casting Out Demons</h2>
<p>The anointed ministry of the Lord also released those who were exiles and prisoners under Satan&rsquo;s bondage by casting out demons (Isa. 42:7). The Lord Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8). Therefore, part of the signs and wonders that He did in His ministry was to cast out demons, Satan&rsquo;s subordinates, from demon-possessed people (Mark 1:34, 39; 3:15; 6:7, 13; 16:17) that they might be delivered from Satan&rsquo;s bondage (Luke 13:16), out of Satan&rsquo;s authority of darkness, into God&rsquo;s kingdom (Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Establishing Justice in the Earth</h2>
<p>Isaiah 42:4a prophesied concerning Christ in His ministry, saying, &ldquo;He will not faint, nor will He be discouraged, / Until He has established justice in the earth.&rdquo; The Hebrew word translated as <em>justice</em> has the meaning of &ldquo;judgment, verdict.&rdquo; This means that when we have Christ, we have judgment and justice. Christ is justice (judgment); therefore, Christ is the answer. Isaiah prophesied that Christ the Servant of Jehovah would establish justice in the earth. This means that the Gentiles will receive the all-inclusive Christ as the judgment and answer to everything, issuing in peace and satisfaction. Justice is the issue of righteousness through judgment. The judgment of righteousness is justice. The salvation that we have received is the result of God&rsquo;s judgment on Christ. Christ is righteous, but as our Substitute He was judged by God according to His righteous law, completely fulfilling all the requirements of the law. The result of God&rsquo;s judgment was justice, salvation. Therefore, in Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy justice is the salvation brought forth through judgment. Christ, as the Servant of Jehovah, established justice in the earth as the righteous One who passed through the verdict of the judgment of the righteous God to bring forth justice. This justice is the salvation that He has established in this earth.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Revealing the Mysteries of the Kingdom <br />
by Speaking in Parables</h2>
<p>Psalm 78:2 says, &ldquo;I will open my mouth in a parable; / I will utter riddles from of old.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 13:35, &ldquo;I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.&rdquo; This word continues the fulfillment of the prophecy in Psalm 78. In His earthly ministry Christ revealed the things of the kingdom in parables in order to make them mysteries to the opposing and rejecting Jews so that they would not understand them. The Lord said, &ldquo;I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand...For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed&rdquo; (Matt. 13:13-15). However, His disciples were blessed because they saw and heard the mysteries of the kingdom revealed by the Lord through the parables that He spoke.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. HIS ENTERING INTO JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>Concerning Christ&rsquo;s entering into Jerusalem at the end of His ministry, the Old Testament has three main prophecies in Isaiah 62:11, Zechariah 9:9, and Psalm 118:26. These Scriptures speak concerning Christ as the meek King mounted on a donkey&rsquo;s colt in a lowly way and entering Jerusalem triumphantly, to whom the crowds cried, &ldquo;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!&rdquo; These prophecies fully came to pass through the events portrayed in Matthew 21:4-9 and 16.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being in Lowliness and Meekness</h2>
<p>Isaiah 62:11 prophesies concerning Christ&rsquo;s entering into Jerusalem, and Zechariah 9:9 further prophesies concerning the way Christ entered into Jerusalem, saying, &ldquo;Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion; / Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! / Now your King comes to you. / He is righteous and bears salvation, / Lowly and riding upon a donkey, / Even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey.&rdquo; According to the record in the four Gospels, this verse was fulfilled when Jesus Christ came into Jerusalem the last time. The term <em>daughter of Zion</em> denotes the inhabitants of Jerusalem (cf. Psa. 137:8; 45:12). The Lord Jesus&rsquo; going into Jerusalem was not to fight or to compete but to be a meek King. He had no intention to come as a great King fighting or competing with others; He came to be a lowly King, a humble King, riding not on a majestic horse but meekly on a colt.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Praised by the Crowds</h2>
<p>When the heavenly King entered into Jerusalem, He received the warm welcome of the crowds. They cried out, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!&rdquo; (Matt. 21:9). <em>Hosanna</em> in Hebrew (<em>hoshiah-na</em>) means &ldquo;save now.&rdquo; The cry of the crowd was a quotation from Psalm 118:25-26: &ldquo;O Jehovah, do save, we pray! / O Jehovah, do send prosperity, we pray! / Blessed is He who comes in the name of Jehovah.&rdquo; The warm welcome the Lord received when entering Jerusalem, as recorded in Matthew 21:9, fulfilled the prophecy in Psalm 118. As a meek King, He was qualified to receive such praise, because He did not come in His own name but in the name of God.</p>
<p>After entering Jerusalem, the Lord went into the temple, and many children cried out, saying, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David&rdquo; (Matt. 21:15). The priests and scribes were indignant because of this. However, the Lord Jesus asked them, &ldquo;Have you never read, &lsquo;Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise&rsquo;?&rdquo; (v. 16). In asking this, the Lord quoted the prophecy in Psalm 8:2: &ldquo;Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings / You have established strength / Because of Your adversaries, / To stop the enemy and the avenger.&rdquo; Thus, the Lord indicated that He was the fulfillment of the prophecy in Psalm 8. Babes and sucklings are the youngest, smallest, and weakest ones, which typify the children of the kingdom of the heavens. The Septuagint version translates the Hebrew word <em>strength</em> into &ldquo;praise,&rdquo; which the Lord also agreed with and used, quoting it in Matthew 21:16. This indicates that to praise is for strength to issue out of the mouth. God is working in man so that the weakest ones and the smallest ones can offer, out of their mouths, praises full of strength. In this way He perfects praise and stops the enemy and His avenger.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p><em>Christ</em> is the equivalent of the Hebrew word <em>Messiah,</em> which means &ldquo;the anointed.&rdquo; The earthly ministry of Christ began with His being anointed. Isaiah 61:1 prophesied concerning the anointing of Christ, the Anointed of Jehovah. This verse says, &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me, / Because Jehovah has anointed Me.&rdquo; When Christ was baptized, the Spirit of God descended upon Him. For His whole life, the Spirit of God was also upon Christ in His living and work. Toward man, He did not strive nor cry out, and His voice was not heard on the streets. In caring for His headship and for the members of His Body, He hid Himself. As the anointed One, Christ would not break a bruised reed nor quench a smoking flax. He was always merciful and full of sympathy. Toward God He had full trust. He lived on every word that proceeds out of God&rsquo;s mouth, cast out demons by the Spirit of God, and trusted and looked to the Father as the source of every blessing. He also committed all His insults and injuries to the righteous God who judges righteously in His government. His heart for the Father was absolute and pure; hence, the zeal of God&rsquo;s house devoured Him. When He ministered on the earth, He was despised, forsaken, acquainted with grief, hated, and reproached by man. All the sufferings that He experienced qualified Him to be the Savior of the world.</p>
<p>In the first aspect of His ministry, He was the Servant of Jehovah. As such, He brought good news and proclaimed the jubilee of God so that those who were oppressed under Satan in sin or sickness could enjoy the release of God&rsquo;s salvation. He also healed the blind; He not only healed the physically blind, but He also opened the spiritual eyes of the people. He cast out demons, thereby releasing those who were exiles and prisoners under Satan&rsquo;s bondage. In His earthly ministry He did not faint, nor was He discouraged, until He established justice in the earth. In revealing the mysteries of the kingdom, He used parables so that His disciples might see and hear the mysteries of the kingdom.</p>
<p>In His triumphant entry into Jerusalem, He rode on a colt in lowliness and received the crowd&rsquo;s warm welcome. He was qualified to be praised in such a way because He came in the name of God. The children in the temple cried out to Him, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David!&rdquo; This fulfilled the prophecies in the Old Testament concerning God&rsquo;s perfecting praise out of the mouth of infants and sucklings and stopping the enemy and the avenger.</p>

<p>At the end of His earthly ministry, Christ entered into Jerusalem in a humble and meek way, riding on a donkey&rsquo;s colt. During His three and a half years of ministry, He stayed far away from Jerusalem, the center of Judaism. But at the end of His earthly ministry, He purposely went into Jerusalem to offer Himself as the Lamb of God to be crucified for the accomplishing of His wonderful and all-inclusive death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. HIS STATUS AT HIS DEATH</h2>
<p>According to the Old Testament prophecies, the crucified Christ would be the Messiah who was cut off (Dan. 9:25-26a), the stone that was rejected by the builders (Psa. 118:22-23), a stone to strike against and a rock of stumbling to the Jews (Isa. 8:14-15), the stone engraved by God Himself (Zech. 3:9), and the smitten Shepherd (13:7). Through these prophecies we have a rich realization of the statuses of Christ at His death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Messiah Cut Off after the Sixty-ninth Week</h2>
<p>In Daniel 9:25-26a the angel Gabriel spoke to Daniel and said, &ldquo;Know therefore and comprehend: From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the time of Messiah the Prince will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks...And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing.&rdquo; The phrase <em>cut off</em> refers to the crucifixion of Christ, the anointed One. As recorded in the Old Testament, after Cyrus the king of Persia defeated Babylon, he was moved by God and made a proclamation that the children of Israel could go up to Jerusalem to rebuild the holy temple (Ezra 1:1-3). Then Artaxerxes the king, in the twentieth year of his reign, allowed Nehemiah to return for the rebuilding of Jerusalem (Neh. 2:1-8). According to history and the Jewish calendar, the time from the issuing of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem with street and trench by Artaxerxes until the Passover of the year in which the Messiah (Christ) was cut off on the cross was altogether sixty-nine weeks or four hundred eighty-three years (Dan. 9:25). Christ was cut off exactly on the Passover of that year (John 19:14-16). The prophecy spoken to Daniel by the angel was accurately fulfilled. The words <em>cut off and will have nothing</em> in Daniel 9 refer to the termination of the old creation with the human government in the old creation. This is the glad tidings to us. This prophecy promised that the anointed Christ would terminate the old creation by His crucifixion so that Christ in His resurrection might become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) to germinate those whom God has chosen, His new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Stone Rejected by the Builders<br />
Becoming the Chief Cornerstone</h2>
<p>Psalm 118:22-23 says, &ldquo;The stone which the builders rejected / Has become the head of the corner. / This is from Jehovah; / It is wonderful in our sight.&rdquo; The Hebrew expression for <em>head of the corner</em> can also be translated &ldquo;chief cornerstone.&rdquo; This is a prophecy concerning Christ as the stone rejected by the Jewish builders that became the cornerstone in resurrection. The Lord Jesus quoted this prophecy in Matthew 21:42 to unveil that even though the Jewish builders rejected Him, God honored Him for the building of His dwelling place among His people on earth. In his preaching to the Jews Peter also said that the prophecy concerning Christ being the stone had been fulfilled: &ldquo;This is the stone which was considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner&rdquo; (Acts 4:11). Christ is the stone given to the Jews by God. The Jewish builders, the leaders, should have been working for God&rsquo;s building, but they despised Christ to such an extent that they put Him on the cross. In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy Christ is the stone rejected by the Jewish builders yet a cornerstone precious to God, joining the Jews and the Gentiles (1 Pet. 2:4; Eph. 2:18-21). As our Savior, He makes us living stones (Acts 4:12; 1 Pet. 2:5), and in the process of transformation we are being built into a dwelling place of God in spirit (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 2:19-22).</p><h2 class="head2">C. A Stone to Strike Against<br />
and a Rock of Stumbling</h2>
<p>After the Lord Jesus indicated in Matthew 21:42 that He was the stone rejected by the Jewish builders, He said, &ldquo;He who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces&rdquo; (v. 44). This word is the fulfillment of the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah: &ldquo;Then He will become...a stone to strike against / And a rock of stumbling / To both houses of Israel... / And many will stumble at these, / And will fall and be broken to pieces&rdquo; (Isa. 8:14-15). Furthermore, Romans 9:32-33a, Luke 2:34, and 1 Peter 2:8 refer to the fulfillment of Isaiah 8:14-15. According to the record in the Gospel of Luke, Simeon prophesied that Christ would be appointed by God to be a test to the children of Israel for the falling and the rising up of many (2:34). Since the Jews did not believe Christ and rejected Him, He became a stone to strike against and a rock of stumbling to the children of Israel. Their unbelief caused them to fall and to be broken on Christ the rock (Rom 9:32). Peter said that their stumbling was appointed (1 Pet. 2:8). To the believers, Christ is not a stone to strike against or a rock of stumbling; He is the stone raised up by God, that is, the stone of salvation and building.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Stone Engraved by God</h2>
<p>Zechariah 3:8-9 says, &ldquo;I am about to bring forth My servant, the shoot. For here is the stone that I have set before Joshua...I will engrave its engraving, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.&rdquo; <em>The shoot</em> refers to Zerubbabel who is a type of Christ, and these verses are a prophecy concerning Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in His humanity. At the same time Christ is also the stone set before Joshua. The angel prophesied to Zechariah that Jehovah would engrave the stone, indicating that God would work on Christ as the stone for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s redemption, salvation, and building. To engrave is to cut. When Christ was dying on the cross, He was engraved, cut, by God. Furthermore, the Christ whom God engraved accomplished redemption for the sin of the people in one day&mdash;the day of His crucifixion. John 1:29 clearly refers to the fulfillment of this prophecy. Through His death on the cross, Christ took away the sin of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Smitten Shepherd</h2>
<p>Zechariah 13:7 prophesied concerning Christ being the smitten Shepherd: &ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, / And against the man who is My Fellow, / Declares Jehovah of hosts. / Strike the Shepherd, / That the sheep may be scattered.&rdquo; <em>My Fellow</em> in this verse is the Fellow of Jehovah of hosts, who is Christ. When Christ came as a man to be the Shepherd, not only was He rejected by men; He was even struck, smitten, by God. In Matthew 26:31 the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, &ldquo;You will all be stumbled because of Me this night, for it is written, &lsquo;I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.&rsquo;&rdquo; The Lord quoted Zechariah 13:7 to warn His disciples that He, as the Shepherd, would be crucified, and that God would strike Him with the sword. All His disciples, especially Peter, had the assurance and confidence that they could follow the Lord to the end. However, after the Lord was seized, the disciples were indeed stumbled because of the Lord, just as He prophesied. They left the Lord and fled, becoming scattered sheep (Matt. 26:56b, 69-75).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. HIS BETRAYAL</h2>
<p>The Old Testament prophets also prophesied that Christ would be betrayed by Judas Iscariot.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. By a Familiar One Who Ate Bread with Him</h2>
<p>Psalm 41:9 says, &ldquo;Even my familiar friend, in whom I trusted, / Who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me.&rdquo; This prophecy was fulfilled in John 13:18. After the Lord washed the disciples&rsquo; feet, He said, &ldquo;I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, &lsquo;He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.&rsquo;&rdquo; Mark 14:18 also records that when the Lord was eating the Passover feast with the disciples, He said, &ldquo;One of you will betray Me, one who is eating with Me.&rdquo; The <em>familiar friend</em> and <em>one who is eating with Me</em> refer to Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus. Even though Judas ate with the Lord at the Passover feast, he did not have part in the new testament feast instituted by the Lord Himself (vv. 17-25; John 13:26-30).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Sold for Thirty Pieces of Silver,<br />
the Price of a Slave</h2>
<p>Zechariah 11:12-13 prophesied further that Judas Iscariot, who betrayed the Lord, would sell Him for thirty pieces of silver: &ldquo;I said to them, If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, do not bother. So they weighed out my wages, thirty pieces of silver...So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter, into the house of Jehovah.&rdquo; According to Exodus 21:32, thirty pieces of silver was the price of a slave. Christ was priced as a slave, and Judas betrayed Him for this price, selling the Lord for thirty pieces of silver. Matthew 26:14-15 records that Judas &ldquo;went to the chief priests and said, What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver Him to you? And they weighed out to him thirty pieces of silver.&rdquo; This accurately fulfilled the prophecy in Zechariah 11:12 concerning the Lord Jesus. Furthermore, when Judas regretted betraying Jesus, he threw the thirty pieces of silver into the temple. Since this was blood money, the chief priests used it to buy the potter&rsquo;s field (Matt. 27:3-10). This fulfilled the prophecy in Zechariah 11:13.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>At the end of His ministry, Christ purposely went into Jerusalem to offer Himself as the Lamb of God to be crucified for the accomplishing of His wonderful and all-inclusive death. According to the prophecies of the prophet Daniel in the Old Testament, the crucified Christ is the Messiah cut off after the sixty-ninth week; the phrase<em>cut off</em> refers to the crucifixion of Christ, the anointed One. Christ being cut off and having nothing is for the termination of the old creation with the human government in the old creation so that in His resurrection He might become the life-giving Spirit to germinate His new creation. Psalm 118 prophesies that Christ is the stone rejected by the Jewish builders who became the cornerstone in resurrection. In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy Christ was rejected by the Jewish builders, but He was precious to God. As our Savior, He makes us living stones, and in the process of transformation, we are being built into the dwelling place of God. The prophet Isaiah prophesied that because the Jews did not believe Christ and rejected Him, Christ would become a stone to strike against and a rock of stumbling to the children of Israel; many would stumble at this rock and would fall and be broken to pieces. To the believers, Christ is not a stone to strike against or a rock of stumbling; He is the stone raised by God, that is, the stone of salvation and building. In Zechariah 3:8-9 the angel prophesied to Zechariah that Jehovah would engrave on Christ the stone, indicating that when Christ was on the cross, He was engraved and cut by God. Christ, the stone engraved by God, was the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world on the day of His crucifixion. Zechariah 13:7 also prophesied that Christ would be the smitten Shepherd. When the Shepherd was being crucified, He was struck by God. The disciples were stumbled because of the Lord, as He had prophesied, and they left Him and fled, becoming scattered sheep.</p>
<p>The Old Testament prophets also prophesied that Christ would be betrayed by Judas Iscariot. Psalm 41:9 prophesied that Judas, who ate bread with Christ, would lift his heel against Him and betray Him. Even though Judas ate with the Lord at the Passover feast, he did not have part in the new testament feast instituted by the Lord. Zechariah 11:12-13 prophesied that Christ would be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver&mdash;the price of a slave. Furthermore, when Judas regretted betraying Jesus, he threw the thirty pieces of silver into the temple, and the chief priests used the silver to buy the potter&rsquo;s field.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue to see the prophecies in the Old Testament concerning Christ&rsquo;s death and burial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. PROPHECIES IN THE PSALMS<br />
CONCERNING CHRIST&rsquo;S DEATH</h2>
<p>There are many prophecies in Psalms 22, 34, 40, and 69 concerning Christ&rsquo;s death. In these psalms, David the psalmist typifies the suffering Christ. What he spoke became prophecies concerning Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and the condition of Christ&rsquo;s suffering in His crucifixion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Trusting in God for Deliverance</h2>
<p>Psalm 22:9 prophesies that while He was suffering, Christ still trusted in God: &ldquo;You are the One who drew me forth from the womb, / Who made me trust while at my mother&rsquo;s breasts.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ trusted that God would deliver Him. When people were mocking Him and deriding Him, He was trusting in God, because He had trusted in God even while He was at His mother&rsquo;s breasts. Even though He intended to die, He trusted in God continually, believing that God would deliver Him, that is, cause Him to be resurrected from the dead.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Suffering Men&rsquo;s Reproach, Despising, Deriding,<br />
Sneering, Head-shaking, and Mocking</h2>
<p>Psalm 22:6-8 prophesies that Christ was reproached of men and despised by the people. All who saw Him derided Him, sneered at Him, shook their heads, saying, &ldquo;He committed himself to Jehovah; let Him rescue him; / Let Him deliver him since He takes pleasure in him.&rdquo; To reproach is to shame, to despise is to look down on with contempt and scorn, to deride is to make fun of or laugh at in contempt, and to sneer is to smile or laugh at with facial contortions that express scorn or contempt. After being questioned by Pilate, the Lord was further made fun of by the Roman soldiers: &ldquo;They wove a crown of thorns and placed it on His head and put a reed in His right hand; and they kneeled before Him and mocked Him, saying, Rejoice, King of the Jews! And they spat on Him and took the reed and beat Him on the head&rdquo; (Matt. 27:27-30; Mark 15:16-19). When Christ was being crucified, those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, &ldquo;Save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!&rdquo; Likewise, the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked Him and said, &ldquo;He saved others; Himself He cannot save...He trusts in God; let Him rescue Him now if He wants Him&rdquo; (Matt 27:39-43). The rulers also sneered at Him this way (Luke 23:35). All these events accurately fulfilled the prophecy in Psalm 22:6-8. Hebrews 13:13 says, &ldquo;Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.&rdquo; <em>Reproach</em> here refers to the reproach in Psalm 22:6. This indicates that the New Testament believers need to go outside the camp of religion to follow the suffering Jesus and bear His reproach.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Passing through the Suffering of Crucifixion</h2>
<p>Psalm 22:12-18 continues to prophesy concerning how Christ passed through the suffering of crucifixion.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Being Encompassed and Surrounded<br />
by Evil Men</h2>
<p>While Christ was being crucified on the cross, many fierce men, like the mighty bulls of Bashan, encompassed Him (v. 12). They opened their mouth at Him like a ravening and roaring lion (v. 13). Evil men, a congregation of evildoers signified by dogs, surrounded and enclosed Him (v. 16).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Pierced on His Hands, Feet, and Side</h2>
<p>Psalm 22:16 also says, &ldquo;They pierce my hands and feet.&rdquo; Zechariah 12:10 prophesies concerning Christ as the One &ldquo;whom they have pierced.&rdquo; The fulfillment of these prophecies is found in the New Testament in John 19:34 (cf. v. 37). Christ&rsquo;s two hands and two feet were nailed to the cross, and His side was pierced with a spear by one of the Roman soldiers who executed Him and &ldquo;immediately there came out blood and water&rdquo; (v. 34). John indicates in verse 37 that this fulfilled Zechariah&rsquo;s prophecy: &ldquo;They will look upon Me, whom they have pierced&rdquo; (Zech. 12:10). Two substances came out of the Lord&rsquo;s pierced side: blood and water. Blood is for redemption, to deal with sins (John 1:29; Heb. 9:22) for the purchasing of the church (Acts 20:28). Water is for imparting life, to deal with death (John 12:24; 3:14-15) for the producing of the church (Eph. 5:29-30). This picture shows that the Lord&rsquo;s death, on the negative side, takes away our sins and, on the positive side, imparts life into us. His death is not only for terminating the old creation and redeeming sinners from death, but even more, it is for imparting life and producing the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being Stripped of the Right to Be Clothed and Put to Shame Publicly</h2>
<p>Psalm 22:18 says that they divided His garments to themselves, and for His clothing they cast lots (John 19:23-24). In His crucifixion, the Lord&rsquo;s right to be clothed was stripped from Him, along with His life. They made the Lord Jesus altogether naked in order to have a public, shameful display.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Enduring Great Pain and Agony&mdash;<br />
Being Poured Out like Water,<br />
His Bones Being out of Joint,<br />
His Heart Melting like Wax,<br />
His Strength Being Dried Up,<br />
and His Tongue Being Stuck to His Jaws</h2>
<p>On the cross Christ was poured out like water (Psa. 22:14a). This is the pouring out of His soul, His life (Isa. 53:12). All His bones were out of joint, because He could not hold up the weight of His body as it hung on the cross (Psa. 22:14b). This caused Him great agony and pain. His heart was like wax melted within Him (v. 14c-d), His strength was dried up like a shard, and His tongue was stuck to His jaws (22:15a-b; John 19:28). Finally, God put Him into death, that is, put Him in the dust of death (Psa. 22:15c). Jesus&rsquo; dying was God&rsquo;s putting Him into death. If Jesus had been killed only by man, He could never have been our Redeemer. He would merely have been a martyr. But God judged Him and put Him into death for our redemption (Isa. 53:4, 10a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Men Giving Him Gall and Vinegar</h2>
<p>In Psalm 69:21 David says, &ldquo;They gave me gall for my food, / And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.&rdquo; This prophesies that man gave gall and vinegar to Christ on the cross (Matt. 27:34; John 19:28-30). According to Matthew and Mark, wine mingled with gall was offered to the Lord before crucifixion, but when He tasted it, He would not drink (Matt. 27:34). The wine mingled with gall also had myrrh (Mark 15:23), and it was used as a stupefying drink. Even though the Lord knew that He was going to suffer great pain on the cross, He would not be stupefied; rather, He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs. John 19:28-29 says, &ldquo;Jesus, knowing that all things had now been finished and so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst. There was lying there a vessel full of vinegar; therefore, they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth.&rdquo; Thirst is a taste of death (Luke 16:24; Rev. 21:8). The Lord thirsted on the cross, which means that He tasted death on our behalf and on behalf of everything (Heb. 2:9). Even though He thirsted, man gave Him vinegar to mock Him (Mark 15:36). After Jesus &ldquo;had taken the vinegar, He said, It is finished! And He bowed His head and delivered up His spirit&rdquo; (John 19:30).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being Forsaken by God and Put into Death</h2>
<p>Psalm 22:1 prophesied that Christ was forsaken by God. At the end of His crucifixion, Christ cried out, &ldquo;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo; (Matt. 27:46). Christ was on the cross for six hours, from the third hour, 9:00 A.M., until the ninth hour, 3:00 P.M. In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God&rsquo;s will; in the last three hours He was judged by God to accomplish our redemption. During the last three hours, God counted Him as our Substitute, who suffered for our sin (Isa. 53:10). While He was on the earth, the Father was with Him all the time (John 8:29), but at the end of His crucifixion, God left Him economically. Essentially, God could never leave Him, because He and the Father are one (10:30). But economically, God caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him (Isa. 53:6), making Christ the righteous One, the Substitute for the unrighteous. God considered Christ an offering for sin, making Him sin on our behalf (v. 10; 2 Cor. 5:21) and judging Him. Hence, God economically left Him temporarily so that man&rsquo;s sin and sins and all negative things could be dealt with on the cross.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Not One of His Bones Being Broken</h2>
<p>In Psalm 34:20 David says, &ldquo;He keeps all his bones; / Not one of them is broken.&rdquo; This prophesied that when Christ was crucified, His legs would not be broken (John 19:33, 36). The day Christ was crucified was the day of preparation for the Passover, and the next day (beginning at six o&rsquo;clock in the evening) was the Sabbath (v. 14; Luke 23:54). The Jews, not wanting the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath, asked Pilate that the legs of Jesus and the other two crucified with Him be broken to hasten their death (John 19:31). But when the soldiers came to Jesus, they saw that He had already died, so they did not break His legs (v. 33). Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty not one of the Lord&rsquo;s bones was broken. This fulfilled both the type of the lamb of the passover in Exodus 12:46 and the prophecy in Psalm 34:20. The death of Christ was not due to the soldiers breaking His legs. This indicates that even though Christ was crucified, He Himself was willing to die and give up His life. This fulfilled what Christ had said to the disciples concerning His life: &ldquo;No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again&rdquo; (John 10:18). He gave up His life in order to redeem sinners. Furthermore, in the Bible bone signifies life (cf. Gen. 2:21-22). The fact that Christ&rsquo;s legs were not broken indicates that in Him is an unbreakable and indestructible eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Doing God&rsquo;s Will</h2>
<p>Psalm 40:6-8 says, &ldquo;You do not delight in sacrifice and offering; / You have prepared ears for Me; / You do not require burnt offering and sin offering. / Then I said, / Behold, I have come; / In the scroll of the book / It is written concerning Me. / I delight in doing Your will, O My God; / Indeed Your law is within My inward parts.&rdquo; This is a prophecy concerning Christ&rsquo;s doing God&rsquo;s will by being the sacrifice that satisfies God and man. Hebrews 10:5-8 refers to the fulfillment of this prophecy. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Coming into the world, He says, &lsquo;Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me.&rsquo;&rdquo; All the offerings sacrificed according to the law are shadows of Christ. In the fullness of time Christ came to replace the animal sacrifices of the law by putting on flesh and blood. In His flesh He offered Himself to God once for all and put away sin (9:26). Hebrews 10:9-10 says that the will of God was to take away the first, the animal sacrifices of the old covenant, that the second, the sacrifice of Christ of the new testament, might be established. Christ is the real sin offering that has taken away sin. He sanctified us by offering His body once for all.</p>
<p>The Triune God determined in His divine plan in eternity past that the second of the Divine Trinity would be incarnated and die on the cross to accomplish His eternal redemption for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose (Eph. 1:7-9). Hence, before the foundation of the world, that is, in eternity past (1 Pet. 1:19-20), the second of the Divine Trinity was ordained to be the Lamb of God (John 1:29); and in the eyes of God He was slain as the Lamb of God from the foundation of the world, that is, from the creation of God&rsquo;s creatures, who became fallen (Rev. 13:8). From the time of man&rsquo;s fall, lambs, sheep, calves, and bulls were used as types for God&rsquo;s chosen people (Gen. 3:21; 4:4; 8:20; 22:13; Exo. 12:3-8; Lev. 1:2), pointing to Him who was to come as the real Lamb foreordained by God. In the fullness of time the Triune God sent the second of the Divine Trinity, the Son of God, to come in incarnation to take a human body (Heb. 10:5) that He might be offered to God on the cross (9:14; 10:12) to do the will of the Triune God (v. 7), that is, to replace the sacrifices and offerings, which were types, with Himself in His humanity as the unique sacrifice and offering for the sanctification of God&rsquo;s chosen people (vv. 9-10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. PROPHECIES IN ISAIAH<br />
CONCERNING CHRIST&rsquo;S DEATH AND BURIAL</h2>
<p>The prophecies in Isaiah concerning Christ&rsquo;s death and burial are seen mainly in chapter 53. The emphasis of the prophecies in this chapter is that the Savior Christ died a vicarious death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Bearing Our Sicknesses<br />
and Carrying Our Sorrows&mdash;<br />
Being Wounded for Our Transgressions<br />
That We May Be Healed by His Stripes</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:4-5 says, &ldquo;Surely He has borne our sicknesses, / And carried our sorrows; /...But He was wounded because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed.&rdquo; This prophecy says that in His vicarious death, Christ bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows (Matt. 8:17). In this portion of the Scriptures, sicknesses and sorrows are mentioned with iniquities and transgressions. This means that man&rsquo;s sicknesses and sorrows come from sin. Because man committed sins, sicknesses and sorrows were produced; thus, we need Christ&rsquo;s redemption to solve the problems of our iniquities and transgressions. When Christ was on the cross being judged by God, who put all iniquities upon Him, He took away the sin of the world (John 1:29) and also bore our sicknesses and sorrows. The stripes He received also were a suffering that resulted in death. Because of the chastening that He suffered, we have peace; because of the stripes He received, which resulted in death, we have been healed from death that we might live in resurrection (1 Pet. 2:24b).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Like a Lamb Being Led to the Slaughter and<br />
Like a Sheep Being Dumb before Its Shearers</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:7 prophesied, &ldquo;He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth.&rdquo; According to Matthew, on the night in which Christ was betrayed, some from the chief priests and elders of the people came to seize Him and bind Him so as to deliver Him to Pilate. This was His being oppressed. While He was being judged before the Sanhedrin, people spat on Him and mocked Him. These were His afflictions. &ldquo;The high priest stood up and said to Him, Do You answer nothing? What is it that these testify against You? But Jesus remained silent&rdquo; (26:62-63a). He could have shut the mouths of the false accusers (cf. 22:22, 34, 46), but He did not argue, vindicate Himself, or justify Himself. Before the Sanhedrin, as a sheep being sheared before the shearers, He did not say one word for self-vindication. His intention was not to save Himself but to save us.</p>
<p>At the time, those who were with Him by His side did not realize that He was dying for them, just as it was prophesied in Isaiah 53:8: &ldquo;As for His generation, who among them had the thought / That He was cut off out of the land of the living / For the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due?&rdquo; Even some &ldquo;esteemed Him stricken, / Smitten of God and afflicted&rdquo; (v. 4b). His oppression, suffering, and persecution were all for us. He died a vicarious death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being Executed with Two Transgressors</h2>
<p>The last part of Isaiah 53:12 prophesies that He would be &ldquo;numbered with the transgressors.&rdquo; This prophecy was fulfilled in Luke 23:33, which says, &ldquo;When they [the soldiers] came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.&rdquo; Christ was executed with two criminals. This fact indicates that the Roman ruler considered Him to be a criminal. This was done under the sovereignty of God so that the prophecy in Isaiah concerning Christ&rsquo;s execution might be fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Interceding for the Transgressors</h2>
<p>Isaiah also prophesies that Christ &ldquo;bore the sin of many / And interceded for the transgressors&rdquo; (53:12b). This was fulfilled in Luke 23:34, which says, &ldquo;Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing&rdquo; (v. 34). While on the cross, Christ interceded not only for the transgressors who were beside Him, one of whom confessed and repented immediately (vv. 40-42), but also for those who were killing Him, asking the Father to forgive them for their sins committed in ignorance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Jehovah Causing <br />
the Iniquity of Us All to Fall on Him; <br />
His Bearing Our Iniquities and Becoming Sin for Us</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:6b prophesied, &ldquo;Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him.&rdquo; The second half of verses 11 and 12 also prophesy that Christ would bear the iniquities of many. After God caused our iniquities to fall on the crucified Christ, God considered Him the unique sinner, even sin itself. According to 2 Corinthians 5:21, God made Christ, who did not know sin, to be sin on our behalf. In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies, Christ not only died as our Substitute bearing our iniquities; He was also made sin on our behalf and was judged by God once for all.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Becoming the Sin Offering,<br />
Pouring Out His Life unto Death</h2>
<p>The first half of Isaiah 53:10 says, &ldquo;Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief. / ...He makes Himself an offering for sin.&rdquo; People think that it was either men or Satan who killed the Lord; actually, it was God who was pleased to crush Him, to put Him on the cross. God &ldquo;loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins&rdquo; (1 John 4:10). <em>He makes Himself an offering for sin</em> in Hebrew has the sense of &ldquo;when His soul would make an offering for sin.&rdquo; This implies that Christ volunteered to be an offering for sin. This does not refer to a sin offering but to an offering for sin in its totality&mdash;for wrongdoings, mistakes, trespasses, transgressions, evildoings, and iniquities. Isaiah 53:12b prophesies that Christ &ldquo;poured out His life unto death.&rdquo; Christ on the cross suffered and poured out His human life to be an offering. Philippians 2:8 says that Christ became &ldquo;obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every offering, if it is a sacrifice, must be killed, and the blood must be poured out. Christ volunteered to be an offering for sin. For this He poured out His life unto death. Christ died for our wrongdoings, mistakes, trespasses, transgressions, evildoings, and iniquities; thus, His death is altogether a vicarious death.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Being Buried with a Rich Man</h2>
<p>Although Christ had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth, He was crucified and was assigned by man a grave with the wicked, but in God&rsquo;s sovereignty, He was &ldquo;with a rich man in His death&rdquo; (Isa. 53:9; Matt. 27:57-60). While the Lord Jesus was dying on the cross, many evil things and sufferings came to Him. Some people treated Him evilly, and others mocked Him. Everything in His environment was dark. Despite the evil events and His considerable suffering, Christ endured them all and passed through them victoriously. After the Lord&rsquo;s death, His situation immediately changed from suffering to honor. Joseph, an honorable member of the Council and a rich man of Arimathea, went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Moreover, Nicodemus, a Jewish ruler (John 3:1), brought mixed spices of myrrh and aloes. These two prepared the Lord&rsquo;s body for burial (19:38-40; Mark 15:43; Matt. 27:57-58). Then, as in Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy, Christ was buried in the new tomb of the rich man, Joseph of Arimathea (John 19:41; Matt. 27:59-60).</p>
<p>Christ was put to death in shame, but He was buried in honor and rested in human honor. According to God&rsquo;s sovereignty, He rested in the highest standard of human honor, waiting for the time to resurrect from among the dead.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>There are many prophecies in Psalms 22, 34, 40, and 69 concerning Christ&rsquo;s death. He was reproached by men and despised by people. All who saw Him derided Him, sneered at Him, and shook their heads. Even though Christ suffered, He still trusted in God, because He had trust in God even while He was at His mother&rsquo;s breasts. While He was being crucified, fierce men encompassed Him. They opened their mouth at Him like a ravening and roaring lion. Evil men, as a congregation of evildoers, surrounded and enclosed Him like dogs. They divided His garments to themselves, and for His clothing they cast lots. On the cross Christ was poured out like water, all His bones were out of joint, His heart melted like wax, His strength was dried up like a shard, and His tongue was stuck to His jaws. On the cross Christ&rsquo;s hands, feet, and side were pierced. Blood and water came out of His pierced side to take away sins on the negative side and to dispense life on the positive side. God caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Christ, making Him the Substitute for unrighteous sinners. God considered Christ an offering for sin, making Him sin on our behalf and judging Him. Christ would not be stupefied; rather, He drank the bitter cup to the dregs. Moreover, not one of His bones was broken. This indicates that in Christ is an unbreakable and indestructible eternal life that can be dispensed into His believers. By being the sacrifice that satisfies God and man, Christ in His flesh offered Himself to God once for all and put away sin, thereby doing the will of God.</p>
<p>Isaiah 53 prophesied concerning Christ&rsquo;s vicarious death and His burial. Christ bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows, was wounded because of our transgressions, and was crushed because of our iniquities. The chastening for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we have been healed. Christ was oppressed and afflicted, but He did not open His mouth. Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, He did not open His mouth. Those who were with Jesus did not realize His vicarious death; they esteemed Him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted. However, His oppression, suffering, and persecution were for us. He died a vicarious death. Christ was numbered with the transgressors, but He alone bore the sin of many. While on the cross, Christ interceded not only for the transgressors who were beside Him, one of whom confessed and repented immediately, but also for those who were killing Him, asking the Father to forgive them for their sins committed in ignorance. Christ had done no violence nor was there any deceit in His mouth, but He was crucified and was assigned by man a grave with the wicked. But in God&rsquo;s sovereignty, He was with a rich man in His death. He rested in the highest standard of human honor, waiting for resurrection. He died because Jehovah was pleased to crush Him and make Him an offering for sin. Christ poured out His human life as an offering by passing through death and shedding His blood. His death was altogether a vicarious death.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will see how the prophets in the Old Testament prophesied concerning Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. BEING RAISED FROM THE DEAD ON THE THIRD DAY</h2>
<p>Hosea 6:2 prophesied that Christ would be raised from the dead on the third day. In 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 Paul speaks of the fulfillment of this prophecy: &ldquo;Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.&rdquo; When the Lord was carrying out His ministry on the earth, He repeatedly revealed to His disciples that He would be killed and on the third day He would be raised (John 2:19; Matt. 16:21; 17:23; 20:19; 27:63; Mark 8:31; Luke 18:33). Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John testify concerning the fulfillment of this prophecy (Matt. 27:62&mdash;28:6; Mark 16:1-6; Luke 24:1-8; John 20:1-9). Christ being raised from the dead was not an accident; rather, it was planned by God in His economy for the accomplishing of His eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BEING THE HOLY ONE OF JEHOVAH <br />
WHOSE SOUL JEHOVAH WOULD NOT LEAVE IN HADES <br />
AND WHOM HE WOULD NOT PERMIT <br />
TO SEE CORRUPTION</h2>
<p>In Psalm 16:9-11 we have a prophecy concerning Christ as the Holy One of Jehovah whose soul Jehovah would not leave in Hades and whom He would not permit to see corruption (cf. Acts 2:27). Therefore, His heart was made glad, His soul exulted, and His flesh rested in hope while He was in Hades (v. 26). Hades is the place for keeping the spirit and soul of the dead (Luke 16:22-23). <em>Corruption</em> in Acts 2:27 refers to the corruption of the body in the tomb. The Greek word translated &ldquo;rest&rdquo; in verse 26 can also be rendered &ldquo;dwell,&rdquo; &ldquo;reside,&rdquo; and &ldquo;pitch its tent.&rdquo; After Christ died on the cross, His soul exulted in Hades, and His flesh, His body, was in a tomb, resting in hope because He trusted in God. Acts 2:24-31 and 13:35 speak of the fulfillment of this prophecy. Not only so, Jehovah also made known to Christ the ways of life (Psa. 16:11; Acts 2:28). The ways of life are the ways to come out of death into resurrection. God raised Christ up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Christ to be held by death (v. 24). Christ is both God and resurrection (John 1:1; 11:25), possessing the indestructible life (Heb. 7:16); hence, death is not able to hold Him. Rather, death was defeated by Him, and He rose up from it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. BEING BEGOTTEN AS THE FIRSTBORN SON OF GOD</h2>
<p>Psalm 2:7 prophesied that Christ in resurrection would be born as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son: &ldquo;He said to Me: You are My Son; / Today I have begotten You.&rdquo; This corresponds with the prophecy in 2 Samuel 7:14a: &ldquo;I will be his Father, and he will be My son.&rdquo; Both verses are quoted in Hebrews 1:5: &ldquo;To which of the angels has He ever said, &lsquo;You are My Son; this day have I begotten You&rsquo;? And again, &lsquo;I will be a Father to Him, and He will be a Son to Me&rsquo;?&rdquo; <em>This day</em> refers to the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Acts 13:33). Through resurrection, Christ was begotten as God&rsquo;s Firstborn. Christ is already the only begotten Son of God in eternity (John 1:18; Rom. 8:3). By incarnation, He was born of a human virgin and put on humanity, an element which had nothing to do with divinity. His humanity needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection. Through resurrection, His human nature was uplifted into the divine sonship so that He was designated the Son of God with His humanity to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son (Rom. 1:4; 8:29; Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5). In resurrection the only begotten Son of God was made the firstborn Son, possessing both divinity and an uplifted humanity, and His believers were also born with Him on the day of His resurrection to be His many brothers and the many sons of God.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. BEING THE HOLY THINGS, THE FAITHFUL THINGS&mdash;<br />
THE SURE MERCIES SHOWN TO DAVID</h2>
<p>Isaiah 55:3 prophesied concerning the resurrected Christ being the sure mercies shown to David, the faithful things. Christ is the sure mercies and blessings to us. Acts 13:34 refers to this prophecy: &ldquo;As to His having raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, &lsquo;I will give you the holy things of David, the faithful things.&rsquo;&rdquo; God promised to give the resurrected Christ to His people as a gift; this One is the holy and faithful things of David. The phrase <em>the holy things of David, the faithful things</em> indicates that Christ was of David, for it was out of David&rsquo;s seed that God raised up such a One. The Greek word for &ldquo;the holy things&rdquo; is in the plural. The same Greek word is translated &ldquo;Holy One&rdquo; in Acts 13:35, but in the singular. However, it is not the regular word for &ldquo;holy&rdquo;; it is a Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word <em>chesed,</em> which is translated as &ldquo;mercies&rdquo; in Isaiah 55:3 and also in 2 Chronicles 6:42 and Psalm 89:1 in both the Septuagint and the King James Version. The word <em>mercies</em> (in plural) in Psalm 89:1 is the same word for <em>Holy One</em> in singular in verse 19. This shows that the Holy One is Christ, the seed of David, in whom God&rsquo;s mercies are centered and conveyed. The word <em>faithful</em> means &ldquo;trustworthy.&rdquo; The resurrected Christ is the holy things, the faithful things, and the trustworthy One given to us by God. These holy and trustworthy things are all aspects of Christ. How much Christ is to us as the holy and trustworthy things! In the Old Testament these things are regarded as mercies. For this reason, Isaiah 55:3 speaks of the resurrected Christ being &ldquo;the sure mercies shown to David.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. SEEING A SEED AND THE FRUIT OF HIS TRAVAIL</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:10b-11a says, &ldquo;He will see a seed, He will extend His days, / And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand. / He will see the fruit of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied.&rdquo; These verses prophesied that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection would be a reproductive resurrection. <em>Seed</em> here is singular, indicating that this seed is a corporate seed. In resurrection Christ will see a seed, which is His church. As His seed, the church is constituted of the many believers who are produced as the many grains by the death of Christ, the one grain, and by His reproductive resurrection (John 12:24; 1 Pet. 1:3). Christ not only sees a seed; He also extends His days. Today Christ is extending His days by living in His believers. As His seed, His believers are His extension, just as one of our hymns says, &ldquo;We are Thy continuation, / Thy life-increase and Thy spread&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #203, stanza 4).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand&rdquo; (Isa. 53:10). According to Ephesians 1:5 and 9, the good pleasure of God is God&rsquo;s eternal economy, accomplished through God&rsquo;s dispensing, for the producing of many sons to become the members of Christ, who constitute the church as the corporate expression of Christ. This is the greatest pleasure of God, and it altogether depends on Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. This great pleasure will prosper in the hand of the resurrected Christ. This means that Christ&rsquo;s hand is still moving and working to produce more believers for the pleasure of God. The fruit of His travail is the fruit of the travail of His death, which is also corporate, including all believers, that is His church. When Christ sees the church, He is satisfied with the church, just as Adam was satisfied when he saw Eve.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. BEING THE RESURRECTED,<br />
RIGHTEOUS SERVANT OF JEHOVAH<br />
THROUGH WHOM MANY WOULD BE JUSTIFIED</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:11b says, &ldquo;By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant, will make the many righteous.&rdquo; This prophecy was fulfilled by Christ as the resurrected, righteous Servant of Jehovah through whom many are justified, as seen in Acts 13:39 and Romans 4:25.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Christ in Resurrection Being <br />
Our Righteousness</h2>
<p>Acts 13:39 says, &ldquo;From all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified.&rdquo; &ldquo;This One&rdquo; is Christ, who was resurrected to be the firstborn Son of God and our Savior. Christ justifies us from all the things from which we were not able to be justified by the law of Moses. Not only so, this One by whom we are justified is our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30). Today Christ in resurrection is our righteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Christ in Resurrection<br />
Being the Proof of Our Justification by God</h2>
<p>The New Testament also reveals that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is a proof of our justification by God. Romans 4:25 says, &ldquo;Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification.&rdquo; The death of Christ fully satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements; hence, we are justified by God through His death (3:24). His resurrection is a strong proof that God is satisfied with His death for us. His death satisfied God&rsquo;s requirements and fulfilled whatever God wanted Him to do for us. Therefore, the resurrection of Christ is the proof of our justification by God. In Christ, the resurrected One, we are justified by God. Furthermore, as the resurrected One, He is in us to live for us a life that can be justified and accepted by God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. DECLARING THE FATHER&rsquo;S NAME<br />
TO HIS BROTHERS AND SINGING HYMNS OF PRAISE<br />
TO THE FATHER IN THE MIDST OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Psalm 22:22 prophesied that Christ in His reproducing resurrection would declare the name of the Father to His brothers and would sing praise to Him in the midst of the church: &ldquo;I will declare Your name to my brothers; / In the midst of the assembly I will praise You.&rdquo; Hebrews 2:12 quotes this verse and indicates that this is a prophecy concerning Christ in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Christ Gaining Many Brothers</h2>
<p>Prior to His resurrection, the most intimate term the Lord used to call His disciples was <em>friends</em> (John 15:14-15). However, after His resurrection, He began to call them &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; (20:17). This is because in resurrection Christ, the only begotten Son of God, was born to be the firstborn Son of God; moreover, God&rsquo;s chosen people were born with Christ to be the many sons of God, the many brothers of Christ, as the components of the church to be the corporate expression of the Father (Heb. 2:10-12). Hebrews 2:11 says, &ldquo;Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers.&rdquo; He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God. Both the firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God are born of the same Father in resurrection and have the same divine life and nature (Acts 13:33; 1 Pet 1:3). Hence, He is not ashamed to call them brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Resurrected Christ<br />
Declaring the Father&rsquo;s Name to His Brothers</h2>
<p>According to Hebrews 2:12, Christ in resurrection declares the name of the Father to His brothers. Because the Father is the source of the divine life and nature, for Christ to declare the name of the Father is to show His many brothers that the Father is the source of the divine life and nature. The Jewish people in ancient times knew God, but they did not know the Father. They knew God as the Creator but not as the Father who regenerates people. Before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, not even His disciples knew the Father&rsquo;s life and regenerating ability. However, on the day of resurrection the Lord came into their midst to declare the Father in order to enable them to know the Father as the source of life. According to John 20 the Lord Jesus visited His disciples in the evening on the day of His resurrection. According to the prophecy in Psalm 22, this was Christ coming to His disciples to make the Father known to them, that is, to declare the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers. This declaration was not simply a matter of mentioning the Father&rsquo;s name; rather, it was an impartation of all that the Father is&mdash;His life, nature, and being&mdash;into the disciples. From such a declaration Peter came to realize that he was a partaker of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). To us, the sons of God, God is no longer merely the creating God; He is also the regenerating Father (1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 1:3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Resurrected Christ<br />
Singing Hymns of Praise to the Father<br />
in the Midst of the Church</h2>
<p>Psalm 22:22 not only prophesied that the resurrected Christ would declare the name of the Father but also says that Christ would praise the Father in the midst of the church: &ldquo;In the midst of the assembly I will praise You.&rdquo; The fulfilment of this prophecy is referred to in Hebrews 2:12: &ldquo;In the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.&rdquo; <em>Sing hymns of praise</em> refers to the firstborn Son, Christ, praising the Father from within the Father&rsquo;s many sons in the church meetings. When we, the many sons of God, the church, meet together to praise the Father, the firstborn Son praises the Father in our praising. It is not that He praises the Father apart from us; rather, He praises within us and with us through our praising. The church is one corporate Body with the firstborn Son of God. In the meetings of the church the firstborn Son, who dwells in His many brothers who constitute the church, sings hymns of praise to the Father from within them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The prophets in the Old Testament also prophesied concerning Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Hosea 6:2 prophesied that Christ would be raised from the dead on the third day. When Christ was carrying out His ministry on the earth, He repeatedly revealed this to His disciples. His disciples also testified concerning the fulfillment of this prophecy. Christ being raised from the dead was not an accident; rather, it was planned by God in His economy for the accomplishing of His eternal purpose. Psalm 16:9-11 is a prophecy concerning the resurrected Christ as the Holy One of Jehovah whose soul Jehovah would not leave in Hades and whom He would not permit to see corruption. Therefore, His heart was made glad, His soul exulted, and His flesh rested in hope while He was in Hades. God Himself also made known to Him the ways of life and raised Him up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.</p>
<p>Psalm 2:7 prophesied that in resurrection Christ, the only begotten Son of God, would be born as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. By Christ&rsquo;s birth in resurrection, His human nature was uplifted into the divine sonship, and He was designated the Son of God to become God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. His believers were also born with Him to be the many sons of God. Isaiah 55:3 prophesied concerning the resurrected Christ being the sure mercies shown to David, the holy and faithful things; He is the sure mercies and blessings to us. Isaiah 53:10 and 11 prophesied that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection would be a reproductive resurrection. In His resurrection Christ produced the church as His extension. The pleasure of Jehovah, which is God&rsquo;s eternal economy, will prosper in the hand of the resurrected Christ. Verse 11 prophesied concerning Christ being the resurrected, righteous Servant of Jehovah through whom many are justified. Today Christ in resurrection is our righteousness and is also the proof of our justification by God. Psalm 22:22 prophesied that Christ in His reproducing resurrection would declare the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers and sing hymns of praise to the Father in the midst of the church. After His resurrection Christ began to call His disciples brothers, because like Him, they had the Father&rsquo;s divine life and nature. Christ in resurrection declared the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers to make the Father known to them. In the meetings of the church, Christ, the firstborn Son, sings hymns of praise to the Father from within the Father&rsquo;s many sons.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will look at the prophecies in the Old Testament concerning Christ&rsquo;s ascension. After His resurrection Christ appeared to His disciples over a period of forty days. Thereafter, in the presence of His disciples He ascended into heaven from Mount Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, being taken up by a cloud (Acts 1:3, 9-12). After His ascension Christ sat down at the right hand of God, the Majesty, on the throne of the authority of God to exercise dominion over the universe for God. Moreover, He was crowned with glory and honor to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy in His heavenly ministry and office. As the High Priest, Christ intercedes for His believers and takes care of their case. He also poured out the Spirit upon His sons and daughters that they may become the corporate and enlarged Christ (2:1-4, 16-18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF JEHOVAH</h2>
<p>Psalm 110:1 is a prophecy concerning the resurrected Christ being seated at the right hand of God in ascension: &ldquo;Jehovah declares to my Lord, / Sit at My right hand / Until I make Your enemies / Your footstool.&rdquo; This verse is quoted numerous times in the New Testament (Matt. 22:44; Mark 12:36; Luke 20:42-43; Acts 2:34-35; Heb. 1:13), indicating that the writers of the New Testament testified unanimously that Christ&rsquo;s ascension fulfilled the prophecy in Psalm 110:1. The right hand of God is the highest place in the universe. After His ascension Christ sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high (Heb. 1:3). Acts 2:34 also speaks of the Lord Jesus sitting at God&rsquo;s right hand, which is the position of glory, honor, and power (Exo. 15:6; 1 Kings 2:19; Mark 14:62). Sitting at the right hand of God implies Christ&rsquo;s kingship. In His ascension He was made the Lord, the Christ, the Leader of the entire universe, and the Savior (Acts 2:36; 5:31; 10:36).</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s ascension is not merely a matter of His being in a place but of His being in a person, the Father. In His ascension Christ entered into the Father&rsquo;s being and sat down there. Christ&rsquo;s ascension and His sitting on the right hand of God also stress the fact that Christ has accomplished everything for God and us, leaving nothing for us to do. His sitting at the right hand of God signifies that His work has been accomplished and that He is resting there, waiting for only one thing&mdash;for God to set His enemies as His footstool so that He may have complete rest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BEING CROWNED WITH GLORY AND HONOR AND<br />
SET OVER THE WORKS OF GOD&rsquo;S HANDS</h2>
<p>Psalm 8:4-8 prophesied concerning Christ being a man, a little inferior to the angels, but in ascension being crowned with glory and honor and set over the works of God&rsquo;s hands. The fulfillment of this prophecy is confirmed in Hebrews 2:6-9. The first man, Adam, who was created by God in Genesis 1, failed to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose for man. Psalm 8 then alludes in the way of prophecy to another man who will replace the first man to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. Hebrews 2 says that this other man, the second man, who is Jesus, has come and has accomplished so much for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s desire in man. This is revealed in Genesis 1:26 and 28 and is alluded to in Psalm 8:4-8. The first man, Adam, failed, but the second man, Christ, succeeded by replacing the first man.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2:9 says, &ldquo;We see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor.&rdquo; Glory is the splendor related to Jesus&rsquo; person; honor is the preciousness related to Jesus&rsquo; worth, value, and dignity, which is related to His position (2 Pet. 1:17; cf. 1 Pet. 2:17; Rom. 13:7). In 1 Peter 2:7 the Greek word for <em>preciousness</em> is the same as for <em>honor</em> in Hebrews 2:9. After Christ was crowned with glory and honor in His ascension, God gave Him the dominion over all things in His exaltation: &ldquo;You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor and have set Him over the works of Your hands&rdquo; (v. 7). This is similar to what God did with Adam. Adam lost the authority that God had given him, but according to the prophecy in Psalm 8, Christ recovered what Adam lost. The same dominion has now been given to Christ as the second man. He has been crowned with glory and honor and entrusted with the divine dominion, which was lost by the first man, to rule over the entire universe created by God&rsquo;s hands.</p><h2 class="head1">III. BEING EXALTED, LIFTED UP, AND MADE VERY HIGH</h2>
<p>Isaiah 52:13 prophesied concerning Christ being exalted, lifted up, and made very high: &ldquo;My Servant will act wisely and will prosper; / He will be exalted and lifted up and very high.&rdquo; Ephesians 1:20-21 refers to the fulfillment of this prophecy: &ldquo;Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s right hand, where Christ was seated by the surpassingly great power of God, is the most honorable place, the place with supreme authority. The great power that God caused to operate in Christ seated Him at God&rsquo;s right hand in the heavenlies, far above all. <em>Rule</em> refers to the highest office, <em>authority</em> to every kind of official power (Matt. 8:9), <em>power</em> to the mere might of authority, <em>lordship</em> to the preeminence that power establishes, and <em>every name that is named</em> refers not only to titles of honor but also to every name. Therefore, Christ in His ascension is far above not only the angelic, heavenly authorities, whether good or evil, but also the human, earthly ones. The ascended Christ was seated by the great power of God far above all rule, authority, power, and lordship in the universe. He is also far above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. ALL THINGS BEING PUT UNDER HIS FEET</h2>
<p>Psalm 8:6b says, &ldquo;You have put all things under His feet.&rdquo; This prophecy speaks of God&rsquo;s intention to subject all things under the feet of the ascended Christ (Eph. 1:22). God has caused all things to be subjected under Christ&rsquo;s feet. On the one hand, the ascended Christ is far above all; on the other hand, all things have been subjected under His feet. The former is Christ&rsquo;s transcendency; the latter is the subjection of all things to Him. The power that God caused to operate in Christ has put all things under the feet of the ascended Christ and has given the ascended Christ to be Head over all things to the church (v. 22b). Whatever Christ the Head has attained and obtained has now been transmitted to His Body, the church (v. 23a).</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. LEADING CAPTIVE THOSE TAKEN CAPTIVE<br />
AND GIVING GIFTS TO MEN</h2>
<p>Psalm 68:18 prophesied, &ldquo;You have ascended on high; You have led captive those taken captive; / You have received gifts among men, / Even the rebellious ones also, / That Jehovah God may dwell among them.&rdquo; Isaiah 53:12a prophesied, &ldquo;I [Jehovah] will divide to Him [the ascended Christ] a portion with the Great, / And He will divide the spoil with the Strong.&rdquo; The fulfilment of these two prophecies is confirmed in Ephesians 4:8: &ldquo;Therefore the Scripture says, &lsquo;Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Psalm 68:1 is a quotation of Numbers 10:35: &ldquo;When the Ark set out, Moses said, Rise up, O Jehovah, and let Your enemies be scattered; / And let those who hate You flee before You.&rdquo; The background of Psalm 68 is God&rsquo;s move in the tabernacle with the Ark as its center. Wherever the Ark, a type of Christ, went, victory was won. Eventually, the Ark ascended triumphantly to the top of Mount Zion, indicating that Christ would win the victory and ascend triumphantly to the heavens.</p>
<p>According to Isaiah 53:12a, God divides to the ascended Christ a portion with the Great, and Christ divides the spoil with the Strong. This means that in Christ&rsquo;s ascension, there was a demonstration of Christ&rsquo;s victory by the sharing of the captives, the spoil, taken in Christ&rsquo;s victory with God the Father, who is &ldquo;the Great&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Strong.&rdquo; Christ is a Warrior. On the cross and in His resurrection Christ fought the battle, gained the victory, and took spoil from Satan. This is prophesied in Psalm 68:18: &ldquo;You have ascended on high; You have led captive those taken captive.&rdquo; This is also referred to in Ephesians 4:8: &ldquo;Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive.&rdquo; This clearly indicates that in His ascension Christ led captive the saved sinners who had been taken captive by Satan before they were saved through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan&rsquo;s captivity and took them to Himself. Therefore, His ascension implies that His enemies have been defeated. Before Christ ascended, He vanquished every foe. In His ascension He led a train of vanquished foes, as captives from a war, to the heavens in His triumphal procession for a celebration of His victory.</p>
<p>Christ brought these captives to the heavens and presented them to the Father as gifts. Upon receiving the gifts, God the Father gave these captives back to Christ the Son as gifts. After Christ received the captives from the Father as gifts, He transformed the captives in His resurrected life and made them gifts (v. 8b). Then He gave them as gifts to the church, His Body. Hence, Psalm 68:18 prophesied that the ascended Christ would receive gifts, but Ephesians 4:8 says that in fulfilment the ascended Christ gave gifts. On the one hand, when Christ ascended to the height, He received gifts from God. On the other hand, the ascended Christ gave gifts to the church. These gifts are the persons listed in Ephesians 4:11&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. In His ascension Christ made His captured sinners gifts by means of His resurrected life and gave them to the church for the perfecting of the saints unto the building up of His Body. What an ascended Christ!</p><h2 class="head1">VI. BEING THE BAPTIZER IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Joel 2:28-29 prophesied concerning Jehovah pouring out His Spirit upon all His sons and daughters. This prophecy was fulfilled in its initial step on the day of the Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4, 16-21). Acts 2:33 says, &ldquo;Having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear.&rdquo; This refers to how the ascended Christ became the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost is the Spirit of God compounded with Christ&rsquo;s humanity, death, resurrection, and ascension as the realization of Christ and the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. The Triune God poured Himself upon those who called on the name of the Lord. This outpouring produced the church. By this outpouring of the consummated Spirit, all the disciples and saved ones on the day of Pentecost became members of the corporate Christ. By such an outpouring the individual Christ has become the corporate Christ, the enlarged, increased Christ, which is the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:15-16). Prior to this outpouring, there were only the Jews and the Gentiles; through the outpouring of the Spirit, the church as a third entity has been produced (1 Cor. 10:32).</p>
<p>The prophecy in Joel 2:28-29 was fulfilled as a foretaste on the day of the Pentecost, and it will be fulfilled as a full taste at Christ&rsquo;s second coming. At that time God will fulfill His promise of the salvation to Israel, His chosen people, by pouring out His Spirit as the late rain (v. 23) to save and regenerate many returned Israelites.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. BEING A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING<br />
TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK</h2>
<p>Psalm 110:4 says, &ldquo;Jehovah has sworn, / And He will not change: / You are a Priest forever / According to the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo; This is a prophecy concerning Christ in His heavenly ministry as the Priest ordained by God with an oath according to the order of Melchizedek. The fulfilment of this prophecy is referred to in Hebrews 5:6-10.</p>
<p>Hebrews 5:6, a quotation of Psalm 110, says, &ldquo;You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo; This refers to the ascension and enthronement of Christ (vv. 1-4). The order of Melchizedek is higher than the order of Aaron. The order of Aaron was for the priesthood that was only in humanity, whereas the order of Melchizedek is for the priesthood that is in both humanity and divinity. Aaron was made the high priest in honor only for his lifetime, because death prevented him from continuing his service. But as the Son of God, Christ is a Priest forever in glory according to the order of Melchizedek, because with Him there is no preventing of death (Heb. 7:23-24). As such a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, He can minister to us whatever we need and save us to the uttermost (v. 25). Since we have &ldquo;a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God,&rdquo; we should &ldquo;therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help&rdquo; (4:14-16).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. HOLDING THE KEY OF DAVID,<br />
THE KEY OF THE KINGDOM,<br />
WITH AUTHORITY TO OPEN AND TO SHUT</h2>
<p>Isaiah 22:22 says, &ldquo;I will set the key of the house of David upon his shoulder&mdash; / When he opens, no one will shut; / When he shuts, no one will open.&rdquo; The fulfilment of this prophecy is confirmed in Revelation 3:7, because the Lord calls Himself &ldquo;the Holy One, the true One, the One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens.&rdquo; David fought for God, established the kingdom, and prepared everything for the building of the holy temple. Christ the King-Savior is the real David (Matt. 12:3). The resurrected Christ in His ascension is seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high (22:44; Mark 12:36; Luke 20:42-43; Acts 2:34-35; Heb. 1:13), as the Leader of the universe (Acts 2:36; 5:31; 10:36), having the authority to rule sovereignly over all things. Therefore, the key of David is the key of the kingdom, God&rsquo;s key for ruling the universe. Christ holds the key of David; He has authority to open and shut in order to establish God&rsquo;s kingdom, God&rsquo;s dominion, and to build up God&rsquo;s dwelling, God&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>According to Revelation 3 the ascended Christ has the key of David in order to give the church in Philadelphia, a type of the recovered church, an opened door so that people can enter the recovered church to be transformed into pillars in the temple of God and to be built up as God&rsquo;s city, the New Jerusalem (vv. 7-8, 12).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After His resurrection, in the presence of His disciples Christ ascended into heaven, being taken up by a cloud, to continue the carrying out of God&rsquo;s eternal economy in His heavenly ministry and office. Psalm 110:1 is a prophecy concerning how the resurrected Christ at the time of His ascension was seated at the right hand of God, receiving the position of glory, honor, and power. In His ascension Christ was made the Lord, the Christ, the Leader of the entire universe, and the Savior. In His ascension Christ entered into the Father&rsquo;s being and sat down there. He has accomplished everything for God and us and is resting there, waiting for God to set His enemies as His footstool.</p>
<p>Psalm 8:4-8 prophesied concerning Christ being a man, a little inferior to the angels, but in ascension being crowned with glory and honor and set over the works of God&rsquo;s hands. The first man, Adam, failed to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose for man, but another man, Jesus, has come and has accomplished so much for the fulfilment of God&rsquo;s desire in man.</p>
<p>Isaiah 52:13 prophesied concerning Christ being exalted, lifted up, made very high, and being seated at God&rsquo;s right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come. God also subjected all things under His feet (Psa. 8:6b), implying that the Body of Christ together with Christ the Head is far above all and conquers all things. Christ ascended to the height, led captive those taken captive, and gave gifts to men. By means of His resurrected life, He made the redeemed saints gifts and gave them to His Body for the perfecting of the saints unto the building up of His Body (68:18).</p>
<p>Joel 2:28-29 prophesied concerning Jehovah pouring out His Spirit upon His sons and daughters. This Spirit is the Spirit of God compounded with Christ&rsquo;s humanity, death, resurrection, and ascension as the realization of Christ and the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. The Triune God poured Himself out for the producing of the church.</p>
<p>Psalm 110:4 is a prophecy concerning Christ in His heavenly ministry as a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedek. The priesthood of the house of Aaron could not continue, because it was prevented by death from continuing. But Christ as our High Priest forever can minister whatever we need and save us to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Isaiah 22:22 is a prophecy concerning Christ as the One who holds the key of David, who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens. The ascended Christ has the key of David in order to give an opened door to the recovered church so that people can enter the recovered church to be transformed into pillars in the temple of God and to be built up as God&rsquo;s city, the New Jerusalem.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Christ has two comings. In His first coming He accomplished redemption and became the Spirit to dispense Himself into His believers, thereby accomplishing His New Testament economy and laying down a solid foundation for His second coming. In His coming back Christ will take up and judge the believers, marry His bride, slay the enemy, save the Israelites, judge the nations, and bring in the restoration in the millennium. This lesson will explain the prophecies in both the Old Testament and the New Testament concerning Christ&rsquo;s coming back. Through these prophecies God&rsquo;s children can properly understand the truth regarding the Lord&rsquo;s coming back and eagerly wait for the Lord&rsquo;s coming in hope.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. CHRIST&rsquo;S COMING BACK&mdash;HIS PAROUSIA</h2>
<p>Concerning Christ&rsquo;s coming back, the New Testament uses the Greek word <em>parousia,</em> which means &ldquo;presence&rdquo; and is used in reference to the coming of an honorable person. The New Testament uses this word to refer to Christ&rsquo;s coming, indicating that His coming back is His presence as the most honorable person with His believers. In relation to time, Christ&rsquo;s coming will begin from His throne in the heavens before the great tribulation, the last three and a half years of this age (Matt. 24:37-42; Rev. 12:5; 14:1-5; Luke 21:36), it will continue with His remaining in the air during the great tribulation (1 Thes. 4:15-17; 1 Cor. 15:23; Rev. 10:1), and it will end with His coming from the air to the earth at the end of the great tribulation (2 Thes. 2:8).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Beginning of Christ&rsquo;s Coming Back&mdash;<br />
His Coming from the Third Heaven, God&rsquo;s Throne</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being in Secret</h2>
<p>Matthew 24:42-44 prophesies that Christ will come secretly as a thief and that no one knows the time of His secret coming: &ldquo;Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes...For this reason you also be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming.&rdquo; Christ will be sent by God in His second coming as He was in His first coming. The Father is the Sender, and the Son is the sent One. Only the Father who sends the Son knows when that time will be; the Son who is being sent does not know. This is what is said in the Gospels: &ldquo;Concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even...the Son, but the Father only&rdquo; (v. 36; Mark 13:32). Christ&rsquo;s secret coming is mainly for the rapture of His overcomers so that they may be kept out of the three and a half years of the great tribulation. Hence, the believers should be watchful and prepare themselves for the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Appearing as the Morning Star</h2>
<p>At His coming back Christ will be the bright morning star to the overcomers (Rev. 22:16), appearing before the darkest hour, prior to the dawn. At the time of Christ&rsquo;s first appearing, it was not the Jewish religionists but the magi who saw His star (Matt. 2:2, 9-10). At His second appearing Christ will be the morning star as a reward to the overcomers, who love Him and wait in watchfulness for His coming, but to all others He will appear only as the sun (Mal. 4:2). The morning star appears in secret, whereas the sun appears publicly. The Lord promises that if we are watchful and wait for His coming, His appearing as the morning star will be a reward to us.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Catching Up the Man-child&mdash;<br />
the Martyred Overcoming Saints<br />
throughout the Generations</h2>
<p>Revelation 12:5 says, &ldquo;She brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.&rdquo; Verse 11 says that the overcomers who constitute the man-child are faithful unto death; they love not their soul-life even unto death. They have overcome the enemy because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony. These overcomers will be &ldquo;caught up to God and to His throne&rdquo; (v. 5). This is a prophecy that before the great tribulation of three and a half years, Christ will cause the overcoming saints who were martyred throughout the generations to be resurrected from the dead and caught up to God and to His throne.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Reaping the Firstfruits&mdash;<br />
the First-ripe Overcoming Believers<br />
Living at That Time</h2>
<p>At His coming back Christ will also reap the firstfruits, the one hundred and forty-four thousand who stand on Mount Zion with the Lamb (4:1-5). Verse 4 says, &ldquo;These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go. These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.&rdquo; Just as the firstfruits of the good land were reaped and brought into the temple of God before the harvest (Lev. 23:10-11; Exo. 23:19), so the first-ripe believers in God&rsquo;s crop, those who mature earliest, will be reaped first for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. This first-ripe group of living overcomers will be raptured to the heavens before the great tribulation and will stand on the heavenly Mount Zion with the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Taking Up the Other Overcomers&mdash;<br />
the Other Living Overcoming Believers</h2>
<p>Besides catching up the man-child and reaping the firstfruits, Christ in His coming back will also take up the other living overcomers (Matt. 24:39-44; Luke 17:34-36; 21:34-36; Rev. 3:10). Like the firstfruits, these living overcomers will be raptured before the great tribulation.</p>
<p>Matthew 24:39-44 prophesies that these overcomers will be raptured before the great tribulation. These verses say that two men will be in the field and two women will be grinding at the mill: &ldquo;one is taken and one is left...if the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.&rdquo; A thief comes at an unknown time to steal precious things. The Lord will come secretly, as a thief, to those who love Him, and He will take them away as His treasures. Hence, we should watch (v. 42). In Luke 17:34-36, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I tell you, In that night there will be two on one bed; the one will be taken and the other will be left. There will be two women grinding together; the one will be taken but the other will be left. Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left.&rdquo; These Scriptures also reveal that the living overcoming believers will be raptured secretly and unexpectedly. In the context of these Scriptures, the Lord charges us to overcome the stupefying effect of self-indulgent living in this age so that we may be raptured into the enjoyment of His parousia, His presence.</p>
<p>The saints who have kept the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance will also be raptured by Christ before the great tribulation. In Revelation 3:10 the Lord told the messenger of the church in Philadelphia, &ldquo;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.&rdquo; <em>Trial</em> here denotes the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, as indicated by the fifth trumpet, the sixth trumpet, and the seven bowls of the seventh trumpet (Rev. 8:13&mdash;9:21; 11:14-15; 15:1; 16:1-21). The Lord promised the recovered church that He would keep her out of the hour of trial. This indicates that the saints who keep the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance will be raptured before the great trial.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Continuation of Christ&rsquo;s Coming Back&mdash;<br />
His Coming to the Air Secretly</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Coming from the Third Heaven<br />
to the Air Secretly</h2>
<p>After the rapture of the early overcomers, Christ will come secretly in the clouds from the throne of God in the third heaven to the air (10:1; 1 Thes. 4:17) and remain there for three and a half years. This is mainly to take the saints who have not been raptured (the reaping of the harvest), to establish His judgment seat in the air, and to marry all His overcomers as His bride. Revelation 10:1 reveals that during the three and a half years of the great tribulation, Christ will come secretly from the throne to the air in the clouds; that is, He will come down out of heaven, being clothed with a cloud. At the close of the great tribulation, the Lord will come publicly in the air, just as Revelation 14:14 says, &ldquo;Behold, there was a white cloud, and on the cloud One like the Son of Man sitting, having...a sharp sickle in His hand.&rdquo; His sitting on the cloud indicates that at the close of the great tribulation, at the reaping of the harvest, the Lord&rsquo;s coming back will be made public in the air.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Catching Up the Majority of the Saints</h2>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 Paul prophesied, &ldquo;The Lord Himself...will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.&rdquo; This is a prophecy concerning Christ catching up the majority of the saints to the air toward the end of the three and a half years of the great tribulation. This includes the majority of the saints who died throughout the centuries, those martyred during the great tribulation, and the majority of the believers who are still living. This is also the reaping of the harvest referred to in Revelation 14:14-16.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the great tribulation, the Lord will not be clothed with a cloud but will be sitting on the cloud as the Son of Man, indicating that at that time Christ&rsquo;s coming is made public in the air. He will openly reap the majority of the harvest that has ripened. God&rsquo;s people are the harvest of the earth (1 Cor. 3:9). The first-ripe ones will be reaped as the firstfruits to God before the great tribulation. The majority of the saints will ripen with the help of the sufferings in the great tribulation. The suffering of the great tribulation, like the parching sun, will dry up the earthly waters from the believers who are left on the earth in the great tribulation, enabling them to ripen and be raptured.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Setting Up the Judgment Seat of Christ<br />
in the Air</h2>
<p>After all the believers have been caught up to the air, Christ will set up His judgment seat in the air. He will judge all the believers, assigning them either a reward or some kind of punishment. Second Corinthians 5:10 says, &ldquo;We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s judgment of the believers at His coming back will not be concerning their eternal salvation but their dispensational reward (1 Cor. 4:4-5; 3:13-15). This judgment will take into account the believers&rsquo; life and work after they were saved (Rom. 14:10). The Lord &ldquo;will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each from God&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:5).</p>
<p>According to the Bible there are two aspects of God&rsquo;s choosing of His children. The first was before the foundation of the world in eternity past (Eph. 1:4), and the second is the choosing before the judgment seat when the Lord comes to the air. The first choosing is for salvation; the second is for reward or punishment. Those who are saved but fail to pass the judgment will be placed in outer darkness in the millennial kingdom for punishment (Matt. 8:12; 25:30). Christ will then marry the overcoming believers as His bride, enjoy the marriage dinner with them (22:2; 25:1-13; Rev. 19:7-9), and lead them as God&rsquo;s army to come openly to the earth (vv. 11-16).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Marrying the Bride</h2>
<p>After the judgment at the judgment seat in the air, Christ as the Bridegroom will marry the overcoming saints as His bride. Revelation 19:7 says, &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; <em>His wife</em> in this verse refers to the church (Eph. 5:24-25, 31-32), the bride of Christ (John 3:29). In the context of these verses, during the millennium the wife as the bride of Christ consists only of the overcoming believers, whereas after the millennium for eternity the bride as the wife in Revelation 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and the divine life. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age. At that time Christ will come to marry the bride who is ready, that is, the overcoming believers. Such a marriage is the issue of the completion of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>After the marriage there will be the marriage dinner. Revelation 19:9 says, &ldquo;Blessed are they who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb.&rdquo; The marriage dinner of the Lamb is the wedding feast in Matthew 22:2. It will be a reward to the overcoming believers. Not all the saved ones will participate in the marriage dinner; only the overcomers will be invited. The five foolish virgins in Matthew 25:8-12 will miss it. To be invited to the marriage dinner of Christ, which will usher the overcomers into the enjoyment of the millennium, is to be blessed.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Manifestation of Christ&rsquo;s Coming Back&mdash;<br />
His Coming to the Earth Openly</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s parousia will be completed in His being manifested in public, that is, His coming to the earth openly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Coming on the Clouds of Heaven</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s parousia will be completed when He comes openly from the air to the earth at the end of the great tribulation. He will then appear openly to the Jews and the Gentiles. Acts 1:11 prophesies, &ldquo;This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven.&rdquo; Christ was taken away by a cloud in the presence of the Jews in a visible way (v. 9). Hence, He will also return openly on the clouds (Matt. 26:64), just as Revelation 1:7 says, &ldquo;Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him.&rdquo; At that time, at the end of the great tribulation, the returning Christ will appear to the twelve tribes, and everyone in the Holy Land will see Him. Furthermore, the Lord Jesus also prophesied in the Gospel of Matthew, &ldquo;Just as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be&rdquo; (24:27). Christ&rsquo;s coming back openly will be like lightning that is visible to all the people on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Slaying the Antichrist</h2>
<p>In His open coming, Christ will bring His bride with Him as His army to slay Antichrist. Second Thessalonians 2:8 says, &ldquo;Then the lawless one will be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of His coming).&rdquo; This will be fulfilled in Revelation 19:19-20: &ldquo;I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army. And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet, who in his presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone.&rdquo; At His open coming Christ, the heavenly General, will bring the overcoming saints, His faithful ones, as His army to fight against Antichrist, slaying and casting him into the lake of fire.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Gathering and Saving All the Tribes of Israel</h2>
<p>After Christ returns to the earth, He will also openly gather and save the tribes of Israel. Paul says, &ldquo;All Israel will be saved, as it is written, &lsquo;The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob&rsquo;&rdquo; (Rom. 11:26).</p>
<p>Matthew 24:30-31 prophesies, &ldquo;At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the land will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His chosen together from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end.&rdquo; The tribes refer to the nation of Israel, and the land, to the Holy Land. At Christ&rsquo;s appearing His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, and He will save the Israelites who are surrounded by Antichrist and his army (Zech. 14:4-5). Then the Israelites will look upon Christ, and all the tribes will repent and wail (12:10-14; Rev. 1:7). After the great tribulation, at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back to earth, He will gather together the scattered Jews from all the parts of the earth to the Holy Land. This will be the fulfillment not only of His word in Matthew 23:37 but also of God&rsquo;s promise in the Old Testament (Deut. 30:3-5; Isa. 43:5-7; 49:9-13, 22-26; 51:11; 56:8; 60:4; 62:10-12; 27:12-13; Ezek. 34:13; 37:21; 28:25).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Crushing the Gentiles</h2>
<p>At His coming back Christ will also be like a stone, striking the Gentiles, the nations, thereby crushing them to pieces, like chaff being carried away by the wind. Daniel 2:34-35 says, &ldquo;You were watching until a stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the image at its feet of iron and clay and crushed them. Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed all at once, and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.&rdquo; In Matthew 21:44 the Lord referred to this prophecy, saying, &ldquo;On whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff.&rdquo; These verses indicate that when Christ comes the second time, He will be a stone cut out without hands, striking from the heavens the human image, which signifies all human government from Babylon to the revived Roman Empire with ten kings. Christ will be the crushing stone to crush the nations so that they become like chaff being carried away by the wind. Afterward, this stone will become a great mountain, that is, God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Judging the Living Peoples</h2>
<p>Finally, at His coming back Christ will judge the living peoples. This will be the day when God will judge the world through Christ in righteousness (Acts 17:31). This is the day when Christ will judge the living (the peoples living on the earth at His coming back) on the throne of His glory (Matt. 25:31-46). After the Lord defeats Antichrist and his army, many of the Gentiles will still be living on earth. The Lord will gather them before Him for judgment. Matthew 25:31-32 prophesies, &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory. And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.&rdquo; After Christ destroys the Gentiles who follow Antichrist at Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16; 19:11-15, 19-21), the Gentiles who remain on earth will be &ldquo;all the nations&rdquo; and will be judged. Those who are regarded as sheep will be transferred into the millennium to be the people living under the kingly ruling of Christ and the overcoming believers and under the priestly ministry of the saved Jews (2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4-6; Zech. 8:20-23; Isa. 2:2-3). Those regarded as goats will go with their leader, Antichrist, &ldquo;into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels&rdquo; (Matt. 25:41).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s coming back will begin from His throne in the heavens before the last three and a half years of the great tribulation, continue with His remaining in the air during the great tribulation, and end with His coming from the air to the earth at the end of the great tribulation. In His coming back Christ will first appear secretly as a thief and as a bright morning star to the overcomers. He will catch up the man-child, the martyred overcoming saints throughout the generations, taking them up to God and to His throne. He will reap the firstfruits, the first-ripe overcoming believers living at that time. He will also take up the other living overcoming believers, keeping them out of the three and a half years of the great tribulation.</p>
<p>Afterward, at the end of the great tribulation, Christ will come secretly from the third heaven to the air to catch up the majority of the saints, set up the judgment seat of Christ in the air, and choose the overcomers to marry them as His bride and constitute them into an army.</p>
<p>Finally, at the end of the great tribulation, Christ&rsquo;s parousia will be completed in His being manifested openly to the Jews and the Gentiles. He will come on the clouds of heaven, just as the lightning coming forth from the east and shining to the west, so that every eye will see Him. At this time Christ and His overcomers will strike and slay Antichrist, casting him into the lake of fire. Christ will also gather all the tribes of Israel to the Holy Land. Moreover, He will strike the Gentiles, the nations, like a stone, crushing them into pieces, like chaff being carried away by the wind. Afterward, He will become a great mountain&mdash;the kingdom of God filling the whole earth. Finally, sitting on the throne of His glory, Christ will judge all the living peoples, the nations on the earth at the time of His coming back. Those regarded as sheep will be transferred into the millennium to be the people and those regarded as goats will go into the eternal fire.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. IN THE MILLENNIUM</h2>
<p>Zechariah 14:9 says, &ldquo;Jehovah will be King over all the earth.&rdquo; This verse, along with Matthew 25:31-34 and 1 Corinthians 15:25, prophesies that at His coming back Christ will establish His kingdom on the earth. When the Lord comes back, He will save Israel, crush the Gentile nations, and judge the peoples on earth. Afterward, He will establish His kingdom on the earth for a thousand years; this is the millennial kingdom. In the millennium there will be three realms: the first will be the realm of the earth, where God&rsquo;s creation will be blessed (Gen. 1:28-30); the second, the realm of the nation of Israel in Canaan, from the Nile to the Euphrates, where the saved Jews will rule over the earth (Isa. 60:10-12; Zech. 14:16-18); and the third, the heavenly and spiritual realm where the overcoming believers will enjoy the kingdom reward (1 Cor. 15:50-52; Matt. 5:20; 7:21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Ruling over the Nations as the King</h2>
<p>In the millennium Christ with His overcomers as co-kings will reign over the nations (Rev. 20:4, 6; 2:26-27; 19:15b). These nations will be the last stage of human nations on the old earth, and they all will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ (11:15), being ruled by Christ and His overcomers. Such a reigning will be the unique work of Christ in the millennium to show to the entire universe His kingship with His divine and heavenly authority for the shame of Satan, the defeated enemy of God. This is the final fulfillment of Isaiah 32:1, Jeremiah 23:5, and Zechariah 14:9, 16, and 17. After Christ has redeemed the created and lost earth and all people into the realm of His kingdom so that they become constituents of His kingdom (Col. 1:20), after He has sold all that He has and bought the kingdom (Matt. 13:44), and after He has saved the earth and all people from Satan&rsquo;s usurpation (Rev. 20:2-3), He will have the full right to be the King of the restored earth and the restored nations. In His coming reign, God&rsquo;s authority and glory will be fully manifested, and the entire earth, together with mankind, will also be ushered into the righteousness, peace, joy and full blessings created by God (Matt. 6:13; Isa. 32:1, 16-18; 35:1-2, 5-7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Enjoying the Marriage Dinner<br />
as the Bridegroom<br />
with the Overcoming Believers as the Bride</h2>
<p>In the millennium Christ as the Bridegroom will enjoy the marriage dinner with the overcoming believers as the bride. Revelation 19:7 says, &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; The marriage of Christ is the issue of the completion of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Blessed are they who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb.&rdquo; Those who will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb are the overcoming believers; they will also be the bride of the Lamb. The marriage dinner of the Lamb is the wedding feast in Matthew 22:2. It will be a reward to the overcoming believers; only the overcomers will be called to it. The five foolish virgins in Matthew 25:8-13 will miss it. Hence, to be called to the marriage dinner of Christ is to be blessed. Christ, the Bridegroom, will usher the bride, the overcoming believers, into the enjoyment of the marriage dinner with Him in the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. AFTER THE MILLENNIUM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Extinguishing Mankind&rsquo;s Last Rebellion</h2>
<p>At the end of the millennium Satan will be released from the abyss to deceive the nations that are in the four corners of the earth, that is, to deceive Gog and Magog that they may lead the nations to follow Satan and rebel against God. They will go up to surround the camp, the lodging place of the overcoming saints on earth, and the beloved city of Jerusalem, the dwelling place of the remnant of Israel. At that time fire will come down out of heaven from God and devour the rebellious ones. Then the devil, who deceives the nations, will be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet will also be (Rev. 20:8-10). This will be mankind&rsquo;s last rebellion against God. After this final purification, the peoples remaining after the millennium will be transferred to the new earth to be the nations for eternity (21:3, 24).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Judging All the Dead<br />
at the Great White Throne</h2>
<p>After the millennium Christ will judge all the dead at the great white throne, for He is the Judge of both the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1). This judgment is described in Revelation 20:11-15. Verse 12 says, &ldquo;I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened; and another scroll was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by the things which were written in the scrolls, according to their works.&rdquo; <em>Standing</em> here indicates that the dead have been resurrected. This is the resurrection of the unbelievers, the resurrection of judgment, after the millennium (John 5:28-29). The scrolls are the record of the unbelievers&rsquo; works and deeds. The unbelievers will be judged according to what is recorded in the scrolls.</p>
<p>In this judgment &ldquo;the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, each of them, according to their works. And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire&rdquo; (Rev. 20:13-15). The perishing unbelievers will be judged by Christ according to the scrolls, which are a record of their works, and they will also be cast into the lake of fire according to the book of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. IN ETERNITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Husband of the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>In eternity Christ the Lamb will be the Husband, and the New Jerusalem will be the wife. The one thousand years in the millennium will be the wedding day of the Lamb (19:7; cf. 2 Pet. 3:8). On this wedding day the overcoming saints will be the bride to Christ, the Bridegroom. After the wedding day, Christ will live a married life with His redeemed forever in which He will be the eternal Husband, and all His redeemed will be His eternal wife.</p>
<p>In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, God likens His chosen people to a spouse (Isa. 54:6; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:31-32). The New Jerusalem, as Christ&rsquo;s bride, comes out of Christ, her Husband, to become His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam, her husband, to be Adam&rsquo;s counterpart (Gen. 2:21-24). In Genesis Adam typifies Christ as the Husband, whereas Eve typifies the church as the wife. Eve was built with a rib taken from Adam&rsquo;s side and then brought back to Adam to be one flesh with Him. This type will be ultimately fulfilled in the New Jerusalem. Christ will be the eternal Adam, whereas God&rsquo;s redeemed will be the eternal Eve. Christ and His wife will enjoy their married life forever and ever.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being the Temple of the Holy City</h2>
<p>In eternity Christ with God will be the temple of the holy city (Rev. 21:22). According to the Bible, the temple is the place where God dwells and where God&rsquo;s people serve Him. In eternity Christ with God will be such a temple as God&rsquo;s habitation and our dwelling place as well.</p>
<p>Revelation 21 says that the New Jerusalem will be God&rsquo;s temple. This indicates that in the new heaven and new earth, the temple of God will be enlarged into a city. In the New Jerusalem in eternity, Christ with God is the temple for us to dwell in and also for God to dwell among His redeemed so that God in Christ can continually dispense Himself into all His redeemed and enable them to enjoy the all-inclusive Triune God forever.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being the Lamp of the Holy City</h2>
<p>In the New Jerusalem Christ is also the lamp. Revelation 21:23 says, &ldquo;The city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.&rdquo; God is light (1 John 1:5); Christ the Lamb as the lamp will shine with the Triune God as the light to dispense Himself into His redeemed people. God as light needs a lamp. Without the Lamb being the lamp, God&rsquo;s shining would kill us. Apart from Christ God&rsquo;s shining would be a killing, but in Christ God&rsquo;s shining is an illumining. With the redeeming Christ as the lamp, the divine light does not kill us but instead illumines us. First Timothy 6:16 says that God dwells in unapproachable light. In Christ, though, God becomes approachable. Because the divine light shines through the Redeemer, it has become lovable and touchable, and it has even become the light in which we can walk (1 John 1:7). Through the Lamb, the Redeemer, God&rsquo;s killing light becomes an enjoyable shining for the dispensing of God into all His redeemed people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Christ as the lamp will illumine the nations. Revelation 21:24 says, &ldquo;The nations will walk by its light.&rdquo; In the New Jerusalem the Lamb as the lamp will shine with God as the light, and the nations will walk by this light, that is, by its leading. In the millennium the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be intensified sevenfold (Isa. 30:26). In the new heaven and new earth Christ will shine with God as light, and this shining will be brighter than that of either the sun or the moon. Hence, the nations will not need to walk in the sunlight, for they will walk in the light of Christ&rsquo;s shining.</p><h2 class="head2">D. His Throne Being the Center<br />
of the Holy City</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:1 shows that the throne of God and of the Lamb is in the center of the New Jerusalem. God and the Lamb being on one throne proves that God and the Lamb are not separated; God in the Lamb is sitting on the throne. This is what is indicated in Revelation 21:23, which reveals that God as the light is in Christ as the lamp and is one with Christ. In eternity Christ will still be the redeeming Lamb (22:1). Christ accomplished redemption on earth. This redemption was designed by God in eternity past and accomplished in time. Before the foundation of the world, God had appointed Christ as the Lamb to redeem fallen mankind. In time Christ as the Lamb was slain (1 Pet. 1:19-20). In eternity Christ will still be the Lamb, indicating that the redemption He accomplished in time will be brought into eternity. In the New Jerusalem the throne of God and of the Lamb is in the center of the holy city, indicating that in eternity the redeeming God is the Ruler. Furthermore, His reign in eternity is based on the redemption that He accomplished in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being the Supply of the Holy City</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Nourishing the Sons of God<br />
and Healing the People on the New Earth<br />
as the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:2 says, &ldquo;On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; In the New Jerusalem Christ will be the tree of life. The word for <em>tree</em> in Revelation 2:7, as in 1 Peter 2:24, means &ldquo;wood&rdquo;; it is not the word usually used for <em>tree.</em> In the Bible the tree of life signifies Christ as the embodiment of all the riches of God (Col. 2:9) for our food (Gen. 2:9; 3:22, 24; Rev. 22:2, 14, 19). It signifies the crucified (implied in the tree as a piece of wood, 1 Pet. 2:24) and resurrected (implied in the life of God, John 11:25) Christ. In the New Jerusalem this crucified and resurrected Christ will be the tree of life for the nourishment of all God&rsquo;s redeemed people&mdash;the saints as the components of the New Jerusalem&mdash;forever.</p>
<p>According to Revelation 22:2 the tree of life grows &ldquo;on this side and on that side of the river,&rdquo; spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life for God&rsquo;s people to receive and enjoy. This indicates that Christ as the tree of life, as the life supply, will grow and be available along the flow of the Spirit as the water of life to God&rsquo;s redeemed people. Where the Spirit flows, there the life supply of Christ will be found.</p>
<p>In the New Jerusalem Christ as the tree of life not only nourishes the sons of God; the leaves also heal the nations as God&rsquo;s people on the new earth. In the Bible leaves are a symbol of man&rsquo;s deeds (Gen. 3:7). The leaves of the tree of life symbolize the deeds of Christ. In eternity the restored nations will be healed by the leaves of the tree of life. They will take the deeds of Christ as their outward guide and regulation that they may live the human life forever. When the nations look at the way Christ does things and behaves Himself, His deeds will become a source of healing to them, and this healing will maintain their human life forever.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being the Spring of the Water of Life</h2>
<p>In the New Jerusalem Christ is also the spring of the water of life. Revelation 21:6 says, &ldquo;I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.&rdquo; <em>The spring of the water of life</em> refers to Christ. The water of life is the Triune God Himself as our life. This water of life has a source, then a spring, and then a flow, a river. The river comes from the spring, and the spring from the source. The source is the Father, the spring is the Son, and the flow, the river, is the Spirit. In eternity Christ is the spring of the water of life, just as the Spirit is the river, and the Father is the source. According to the picture depicted in Revelation 21 and 22, the river of water of life flows from the spring of the water of life to the entire New Jerusalem, dispensing the Triune God to the whole city and saturating the whole city.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Being the Shepherd of God&rsquo;s Redeemed People</h2>
<p>In eternity Christ is also the Shepherd. Christ&rsquo;s redeemed people still need His shepherding in eternity. Revelation 7:17 prophesies that &ldquo;the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and guide them to springs of waters of life.&rdquo; Shepherding includes feeding. Under the shepherding of Christ, God&rsquo;s redeemed people will not lack (Psa. 23:1). Christ will lead them to the spring of the water of life, indicating that in eternity He will shepherd them into Himself that they may enjoy the eternal dispensing of the Triune God for His manifestation to the fullest extent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>When the Lord comes back, He will save Israel, crush the Gentile nations, and judge the peoples on earth. Afterward, He will establish His kingdom on the earth for a thousand years, which is the millennium. In the millennium Christ with His overcomers as co-kings will reign over the nations. Such a reigning will be the unique work of Christ in the millennium to show to the entire universe His kingship with His divine and heavenly authority to shame Satan. In the millennium Christ as the Bridegroom will enjoy the marriage dinner of the Lamb with the overcoming believers as the bride. At the end of the millennium, Satan will be released from the abyss to deceive the nations that are in the four corners of the earth and to lead them to rebel against God. However, God will use fire from heaven to devour them, thereby purifying for the last time all the peoples on the earth. Then Christ will judge all the dead at the great white throne. The perishing unbelievers will be judged by Christ according to the scrolls, which are a record of their works, and they will also be cast into the lake of fire according to the book of life.</p>
<p>In eternity Christ the Lamb will be the Husband, and the New Jerusalem will be the wife. Christ will enjoy a married life with His redeemed forever and ever. Christ is also the temple of the holy city as our dwelling place and for Him to dwell among men. In addition, He is the lamp of the holy city to shine with the Triune God as the light and to dispense Himself into the redeemed people. The nations will not need to walk in the sunlight, for they will walk in the light of Christ&rsquo;s shining. The throne of God and of the Lamb is in the center of the New Jerusalem, indicating that the Ruler in eternity is the redeeming God. Furthermore, His reign in eternity is based on the redemption that He accomplished in Christ. Christ is also the supply of the holy city as the tree of life nourishing the sons of God and healing the people on the new earth. As the spring of the water of life flowing out the river of life to the entire New Jerusalem, He dispenses the Triune God to the whole city and saturates the whole city. He is also the Shepherd of God&rsquo;s redeemed people, shepherding them to Himself that they may enjoy the eternal dispensing of the Triune God for His manifestation to the fullest extent.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>There are many prophecies in the Bible, but strictly speaking, the building up of the church is the greatest prophecy. We must all pay attention to when and how this great prophecy will be fulfilled. Beginning with this lesson, we will look at the prophecies in the Bible concerning various aspects of the church, including the church being the mystery in God&rsquo;s eternal economy, the church being the kingdom of the heavens, the building up and the stages of the church, and the ultimate consummation of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE CHURCH BEING THE MYSTERY<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL ECONOMY</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that the church is the mystery in God&rsquo;s eternal economy. According to Ephesians 3:4 the church has a particular title&mdash;the mystery of Christ. God is a mystery. He is real, living, and almighty, but invisible. No one has ever seen God (John 1:18a), and therefore God is a mystery. This mysterious God is embodied in Christ; hence, Christ is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2). In Ephesians 3:4 Paul used the expression <em>the mystery of Christ</em> to explain the church as the Body of Christ in God&rsquo;s eternal economy, indicating that the church is the mystery of Christ.</p>
<p>The believers have Christ, the mystery of God, dwelling in them (Col. 1:27), but worldly people do not realize that He is in the believers. To them, this is a mystery. The all-inclusive Christ is the mystery of the mysterious God. Such a Christ as the mystery of God produces a mysterious Body, the church (Eph. 1:22b-23). Thus, the church is the continuation of the mystery, which is Christ. Mystery surely produces mystery. Christ, who is the mystery of God, brings forth the church, the mystery of Christ. The church, the mystery within a mystery, is the mystery in God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE CHURCH AS A MYSTERY BEING HIDDEN,<br />
NOT MADE KNOWN TO GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE<br />
BEFORE THE NEW TESTAMENT AGE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Hidden throughout the Ages in God,<br />
Who Created All Things</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 3:9 Paul says, &ldquo;To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.&rdquo; God is the God who created all things. God&rsquo;s mystery is His hidden purpose. This mystery was hidden in God throughout the ages, that is, from eternity, but in the New Testament age it has been brought to light to His believers. God&rsquo;s mystery, God&rsquo;s hidden purpose, is that God wants to dispense Himself into His chosen people. This is the economy of the mystery of God.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 1:5 and 9 the motive of God&rsquo;s creating all things was His desire and pleasure. God&rsquo;s creation reveals His desire in the universe and manifests His purpose in eternity. Revelation 4:11 says that all things were created because of God&rsquo;s will. Zechariah 12:1 says that Jehovah stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundations of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. This indicates that the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man with the human spirit is for God. God&rsquo;s marvelous creation, focused on man, is for man to be mingled with God to produce the church. God created the heavens, the earth, and billions of items in order to have the church. Therefore, Ephesians 3:9 reveals that the church is the mystery hidden in God, who created all things.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Not Being Made Known to the Sons of Men<br />
in Other Generations</h2>
<p>The mystery of Christ&mdash;the church&mdash;&ldquo;in other generations was not made known to the sons of men&rdquo; (v. 5). The church, the Body of Christ, was hidden in the Old Testament age. None of the Old Testament saints knew anything regarding this mystery. Adam and Abel, who experienced the anticipated salvation, and Enoch, who walked with God, did not know it. Noah received God&rsquo;s command to build the ark, but he did not know of the building up of the church. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph likewise did not know this mystery. Moses received the revelation to build the tabernacle, but, not knowing the mystery of the church, he did not know how to build the church. This mystery was also hidden from Samuel, David, and Solomon, who knew how to build the temple but not how to build the Body of Christ. Similarly, none of the prophets in the Old Testament knew this mystery&mdash;the church.</p>
<p>John the Baptist received more revelation than the Old Testament prophets. He spoke concerning Christ being the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world (John 1:29), being the One who would baptize people in the Holy Spirit (Matt. 3:11), and being the Bridegroom who would have the bride (John 3:29). However, not even John had a clear vision concerning the church as the mystery of Christ. Hence, in the ages before the New Testament, the mystery of the church was hidden from men. It has been revealed to the apostles and believers only in the New Testament age (Eph. 3:5; Col. 1:26).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being Revealed to the Apostles and Prophets<br />
in Spirit in the New Testament Age</h2>
<p>The church as the mystery of Christ was not made known to the sons of men in other generations. In the New Testament age it was revealed first by Christ in the Gospels and then by the Holy Spirit in the Epistles to the apostles and prophets. Paul in Ephesians 3:5 says that this mystery &ldquo;has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit.&rdquo; This mystery, which was hidden throughout the ages in God, who created all things, and was hidden from the Old Testament saints, has been revealed in the New Testament. In Romans 16:25-26 Paul also speaks of &ldquo;the revelation of the mystery, which has been kept in silence in the times of the ages but has now been manifested, and through the prophetic writings, according to the command of the eternal God, has been made known to all the Gentiles for the obedience of faith.&rdquo; This mystery, which has been kept in silence in the times of the ages but has been revealed in the New Testament age, is mainly of two aspects. One aspect is the mystery of God, which is Christ as life and everything to the believers that they may become the members of His Body (Col. 2:2); the other is the mystery of Christ, which is the church as His Body to express His fullness (Eph. 1:22b-23). Therefore, Christ and the church are the great mystery (Eph. 5:32).</p>
<p>The book of Romans first says that the believers have been baptized into Christ (6:3), that Christ has been wrought into the believers (8:10), and that the believers have put on Christ (13:14). Then it reveals that the believers are built together in one Body to express Christ in the local churches (12:4-5), with all the saints in all the churches loving one another and fellowshipping with one another to express the Body of Christ for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s mystery (16:1-16). The eternal God, through the apostles and prophets, has made known this mystery, which was once kept in silence, to all the Gentiles for the obedience of faith.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:26 says, &ldquo;The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints.&rdquo; <em>From the ages</em> means from eternity, and <em>from the generations</em> means from the times. The mystery of the church was hidden from eternity past throughout the Old Testament times, but in the New Testament age it has been manifested to all the believers in Christ. This indicates that the saints today have the position and privilege to receive that which was not revealed to God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament age.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE PROPHECIES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT<br />
CONCERNING GOD&rsquo;S SELECTION OF THE GENTILES</h2>
<p>Since the church was a mystery not made known to the sons of men in the Old Testament age, the Old Testament prophets did not, strictly speaking, clearly mention any direct prophecy concerning the church. The church as a mystery is altogether a revelation in the New Testament.</p>
<p>However, when Paul speaks in Ephesians 3 concerning the church as a mystery, he points out that &ldquo;in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel&rdquo; (v. 6). <em>Fellow heirs</em> indicates that in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy the chosen, redeemed, and regenerated Gentiles and the believing Jews are fellow heirs of God, inheriting God. <em>Fellow members of the Body</em> indicates that the saved Gentiles and the saved Jews are fellow members of the one Body of Christ as His unique expression. <em>Fellow partakers of the promise</em> shows that the Gentile believers and the Jewish believers are fellow partakers of God&rsquo;s promise given in the Old Testament concerning all the blessings of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Therefore, although the church as a mystery was not made known to the sons of men in the Old Testament age, it cannot be denied that God prophesied, through the Old Testament prophets, that He would gain the Gentiles as His children, that they may manifest Him and partake of the promise.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The New Testament Believers<br />
Being Abraham&rsquo;s Spiritual Descendants<br />
Like the Stars of the Heavens</h2>
<p>In Genesis 22:17 Jehovah promised Abraham, &ldquo;I will surely bless you and will greatly multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and like the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.&rdquo; God promised Abraham that his descendants would be like the stars of the heavens and like the sand which is on the seashore. This indicates that Abraham would have two categories of descendants, one heavenly and the other earthly.</p>
<p>According to the revelation in Galatians, Abraham&rsquo;s earthly descendants are the Jews, whereas his heavenly descendants are the New Testament believers. In 3:29 Paul says clearly that the New Testament believers are also Abraham&rsquo;s seed. According to typology, Abraham has only one seed, Christ (v. 16). Since the New Testament believers are one with Christ, they become Abraham&rsquo;s seed out of faith, heirs according to the promise that they may inherit God&rsquo;s promised blessing. Abraham&rsquo;s natural descendants belong to the earthly Jerusalem, to the covenant of law under the slavery of the law. However, his spiritual descendants belong to the heavenly Jerusalem, to the covenant of promise under the freedom of grace (4:22-26). Faith in Christ, who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, enables God&rsquo;s chosen people, according to His promise, to become Abraham&rsquo;s heavenly seed as &ldquo;the stars of the heavens&rdquo; (Gen. 22:17).</p>
<p>God in Christ enlivened the church from the position of death, raised her up together with Christ and seated her together with Him in the heavenlies, the highest place in the universe (Eph. 2:5-6). This was accomplished when Christ ascended to the heavens, and it has been applied to the believers by the Spirit of Christ ever since they believed in Him. Christ as the life of the believers has saved them into a position that is far above all God&rsquo;s enemies, to become God&rsquo;s heavenly people. Thus, as God&rsquo;s heavenly people, the believers&rsquo; commonwealth exists in the heavens, far above all earthly things and their usurpation (Phil. 3:20).</p>
<p>Paul also says in Galatians 4:27, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;Rejoice, barren one who does not bear; break forth and shout, you who are not travailing, because many are the children of her who is desolate rather than of her who has her husband.&rsquo;&rdquo; This is a fulfillment of Isaiah 54:1, showing that the New Testament believers in the church as Abraham&rsquo;s heavenly and spiritual descendants multiply much more than the Jews, Abraham&rsquo;s earthly descendants in the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Gentiles Becoming God&rsquo;s People,<br />
the Beloved Sons of the Living God</h2>
<p>In Romans 9:23-24 when Paul speaks concerning God&rsquo;s selection in His sovereignty and says that God &ldquo;might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory, even us, whom He has also called, not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles.&rdquo; He then quotes Hosea 2:23 and 1:10, saying, &ldquo;As He also says in Hosea, &lsquo;I will call those who were not My people My people, and her who was not beloved beloved; and it shall be that in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people, there shall they be called sons of the living God&rsquo;&rdquo; (Rom. 9:25-26). These two verses were originally God&rsquo;s promise of restoration, spoken through Hosea, to Israel. However, Paul quotes these Scriptures to strengthen a fact in the New Testament that some Gentiles will be selected by God to become His people, the beloved sons of the living God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Gentiles Rejoicing with the Jews</h2>
<p>In Romans 15:8-11 Paul quotes 2 Samuel 22:50, Psalm 18:49, Deuteronomy 32:43, and Psalm 117:1 and says, &ldquo;I say that Christ has become a servant of the circumcision for the sake of God&rsquo;s truthfulness, to confirm the promises given to the fathers, and that the Gentiles should glorify God for His mercy, as it is written, &lsquo;Therefore I will extol You among the Gentiles, and I will sing praise to Your name.&rsquo; And again he says, &lsquo;Rejoice, Gentiles, with His people.&rsquo; And again, &lsquo;Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples speak praise to Him.&rsquo;&rdquo; These words show that Christ has become a servant of the circumcision for the sake of God&rsquo;s truthfulness, and that He has also become a servant of the Gentiles so that they may glorify God for His mercy. Paul&rsquo;s thought here is that Christ has brought together the Jews and the Gentiles so that the Gentiles can rejoice with the Jews. Since Christ is the root of the Jews and also the Ruler of the Gentiles, He joins both together to become one Body, one new man, which is His church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Gentiles Being Gathered Together<br />
to Serve Jehovah</h2>
<p>In Isaiah 56:6 and 8 the prophet prophesied, &ldquo;The children of the foreigner who join themselves to Jehovah, / To minister to Him... / The Lord Jehovah, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, declares: / Yet will I gather others to Him besides those gathered to Him already.&rdquo; This reveals that God will gather more people to Him. First, He gathered the Jews, and then He began to gather more people to Him from such places as Asia Minor and Macedonia. Today He continues to gather people to Christ from throughout the earth. The Gentiles who are gathered to Him will be joined to Him and will serve Him.</p>
<p>Although the Old Testament prophecies say that God will gain the Gentiles to be His people and His children in the New Testament age, strictly speaking, there is no definite prophecy concerning the church in the Old Testament. The church as the mystery of Christ was not made known to God&rsquo;s people before the New Testament age. This mystery was revealed in the New Testament age to the apostles, prophets, and all the believers. We, the New Testament believers, are truly blessed to be able to receive the revelation of the church as the mystery of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>There are many prophecies in the Bible, but strictly speaking, the building up of the church is the greatest prophecy. The church is the mystery in God&rsquo;s eternal economy, the mystery of Christ. The church as a mystery was hidden throughout the ages in God, who created all things. It was not made known to the sons of men in other generations. None of the saints in the Old Testament knew anything regarding this mystery. The church as a mystery was revealed to the apostles and prophets in spirit only in the New Testament age. Moreover, all the saints today have the position and privilege to receive that which was not revealed to God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament age.</p>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that the church and the kingdom are closely related. The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 16:18-19 indicates that the kingdom of the heavens is wrapped up with the church: &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; The phrase <em>the kingdom of the heavens</em> in verse 19 is interchangeably used for the word <em>church</em> in verse 18. This proves that the genuine church is the kingdom of the heavens in this age. Where the genuine church is, there the kingdom of the heavens is also.</p>
<p>In Matthew 13 while on the seashore, the Lord spoke parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom. These parables were of a prophetic nature, covering the entire span of Christian history. They encompass the main points of Christian history between the Lord&rsquo;s first coming and His second coming. In this lesson we will see, from the parables of the mysteries of the kingdom, the prophecies concerning the church with respect to the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE BEGINNING OF<br />
THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Also Being Called the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens, as a specific section within the kingdom of God, is also called the kingdom of God. Matthew 4:17 says, &ldquo;From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.&rdquo; However, according to Mark 1:15 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn near.&rdquo; This indicates that the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God. In Matthew 13:11 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; However, in Mark 4:11 He said, &ldquo;To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God.&rdquo; This is another indication that the kingdom of the heavens, being part of the kingdom of God, is the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being a Specific Section within<br />
the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is a specific section within the kingdom of God. It is the section in God&rsquo;s kingdom where God reigns in a particular way, in the sense of life. With the patriarchs and the children of Israel, the kingdom of God was present in a general way, not in a particular way. At the beginning of the New Testament, John the Baptist called on people to repent, proclaiming, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). This indicates a new beginning. The kingdom of God was there, but it needed a new beginning. This new beginning was the kingdom of God in a particular way, in the way of life. Although the Israelites in the Old Testament times were in God&rsquo;s kingdom, they were in the kingdom of God only in the sense of God&rsquo;s power and authority, not in the sense of life. To be in God&rsquo;s kingdom in the sense of life is something new, something of the New Testament. Therefore, at the coming of the New Testament, God sent John the Baptist as a forerunner to proclaim that God&rsquo;s kingdom was about to have a new start, a start in life. The ministry of John the Baptist was for people to prepare themselves to enter into another stage of the kingdom, to enter into a new start of God&rsquo;s kingdom. Through regeneration man can enter into God&rsquo;s kingdom, that is, the kingdom of the heavens, in the sense of life and in the way of life.</p>
<p>According to the Gospel of Matthew, there are three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens: the reality, the outward appearance, and the manifestation. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward content of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature, as revealed in chapters 5 through 7. The outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward condition of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed in chapter 13. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power, as revealed in chapters 24 through 25. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the proper church life (Rom. 14:17). The outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens includes false believers who are not regenerated. Both the reality and the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church today.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Comprising the Church Age</h2>
<p>As a particular section of the kingdom of God in the sense of life, the kingdom of the heavens must comprise the church age. Today we are in the dispensation of grace, which is the age of the church. The dispensation of grace is altogether a matter of life. Hence, the church has to be a matter of life. Within the church there is the kingdom of God in the sense of life, and this kingdom of God in the sense of life is the kingdom of the heavens, which makes all the kingdom people heavenly in everything and in every aspect, causing them to be people in life and people of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Beginning at the Church&rsquo;s Beginning</h2>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens began at the church&rsquo;s beginning. This means that when the church began on the day of Pentecost, the kingdom of the heavens also began. The beginning of the kingdom of the heavens is indicated by the parable of the tares in Matthew 13. Through the parable of the tares, the Lord prophesied concerning the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field. But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away&rdquo; (vv. 24-25). This parable began to be fulfilled when the church was produced on the day of Pentecost. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is established by the sons of the kingdom&mdash;the wheat. They are genuine believers regenerated by the divine life. The kingdom of the heavens and the church began at the same time and go on in parallel. Through this parable the Lord prophesied that when the kingdom of the heavens was established, that is, after the establishment of the church (Acts 5:11), the enemy would sow tares, false believers, among the wheat, the genuine believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE FORMATION OF THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE<br />
OF THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>In Matthew 13 through the parable of the tares (vv. 24-30, 36-43), the Lord prophesied concerning the establishment of the kingdom and the producing of its false constituents. In verses 24 and 25 the Lord said, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field. But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away.&rdquo; This parable discloses that the kingdom of the heavens is established by the building of the church. However, not long after the establishment of the kingdom, the situation of the kingdom of the heavens changed. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens was established with the sons of the kingdom, the wheat. But the enemy sowed the sons of the evil one, the tares, in the field at the same time to grow amidst the wheat. The tares are false believers, believers only in name, who do not have the divine life in them. They form the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>According to the Lord&rsquo;s explanation, the man who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, the field is the world, the good seed are sons of the kingdom, and the tares are the sons of the evil one (vv. 37-38). That both the tares and the wheat grow in the field means that both the false believers and the genuine believers live in the world. The sons of the kingdom, the wheat, form the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, but the sons of the evil one, the tares, grow up to alter the situation, forming an outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. The sons of the kingdom constitute the kingdom, whereas the sons of the evil one form the outward appearance of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE<br />
OF THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>In Matthew 13:31-32 the Lord used another parable to prophesy concerning the abnormal development of the kingdom: &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, and which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.&rdquo; The church, which is the embodiment of the kingdom, should be like an herb that produces food. However, its nature and function were changed so that it became a &ldquo;tree,&rdquo; a lodging place for birds. This is against the law of God&rsquo;s creation that every plant must be according to its kind (Gen. 1:11-12). This change occurred in the first part of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world. He brought thousands of false believers into the church, making it Christendom, no longer the church. Hence, this parable corresponds with the third of the seven churches in Revelation, the church in Pergamos (2:12-17). The church in Pergamos signifies the church in union with the world through the influence of Constantine. Through the baptism of many unbelievers, the &ldquo;church&rdquo; has become abnormally great. The mustard is an annual herb, whereas the tree is a perennial plant. The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth. But with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled as a tree in the earth, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches in which many evil persons and things are lodged. This resulted in the formation of the outward organization of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE CORRUPTION OF THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE<br />
OF THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>In Matthew 13:33 the Lord used the parable of leaven to prophesy concerning the corruption of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens: &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.&rdquo; In the Scriptures leaven signifies evil things and evil doctrines (1 Cor. 5:6, 8; Matt. 16:6, 11-12). Meal, for making the meal offering, signifies Christ as food to both God and man (Lev. 2:1). Three measures is the quantity needed to make a full meal (Gen. 18:6). The church as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ, the unleavened fine flour, as its content, must be a loaf of unleavened bread (1 Cor. 5:7-8). However, the Roman Catholic Church, which was fully and officially formed in the sixth century and which is signified by the woman here, took in many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ, leavening the whole content of Christianity. Hence, the woman hiding the leaven in three measures of meal signifies that the Catholic Church has leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. This mixture became the corrupted content of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE<br />
OF THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS<br />
EXISTING ALONG WITH THE CHURCH<br />
IN THE CHURCH AGE</h2>
<p>The outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens exists along with the church in the church age, but it does not exist within the church. As a principle, we do not allow tares in the church life, and we do not allow the big tree with its abnormal growth or leaven with its corruption to be in the church. The function of the kingdom people as the reality of the kingdom of the heavens should be like that of the wheat and the mustard seed, supplying life and producing food for the satisfaction of both God and man. They also should be like a lump of fine flour to be food for God and man. This kind of genuine church life is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE MANIFESTATION <br />
OF THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus comes back, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be realized. This is prophesied in Matthew 24:44 through 25:30. Only the overcomers who are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will participate in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the future. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be a reward, a prize, to the overcomers in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Manifestation <br />
of the Reality of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be the manifestation of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. This means that in the next age the reality of the kingdom will become the manifestation of the kingdom. The kingdom of the heavens will exist in the millennium during the age of the millennium. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is with the church in this age, and the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be in the coming age. During the present age, the reality of the kingdom and the outward appearance of the kingdom develop simultaneously. When the Lord Jesus comes back, however, the reality of the kingdom will be transferred into the manifestation of the kingdom, and the outward appearance of the kingdom will be burned away. The Lord&rsquo;s angels will bind the tares into bundles and cast them into the fire (13:40-42). At His coming back the Lord will first deal with the outward appearance of the kingdom, and then He will transfer the reality of the kingdom into the next age to become the manifestation of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Also Being Called<br />
the Kingdom of the Father,<br />
the Heavenly Part of the Millennium</h2>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom will be the kingdom of the Father, that is, the heavenly part of the millennium. The millennium will have an earthly part and a heavenly part. The earthly part will be the kingdom of the Messiah (2 Sam. 7:13), the tabernacle of David (Acts 15:16), and the kingdom of the Son of Man (Matt. 13:41; Rev. 11:15). The heavenly part of the millennium will be the kingdom of the Father (Matt. 13:43). This will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers. The overcomers who participate in the heavenly part of the millennium will reign with Christ over the earthly part, which will be the restored kingdom of David, where Christ as the Son of Man, David&rsquo;s royal descendant, will be the King over the children of Israel.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Being a Reward to the Overcoming Saints</h2>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be a reward to the overcoming saints, including the overcomers in the church in the New Testament age. Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will save me into His heavenly kingdom&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:18). The heavenly kingdom is &ldquo;the kingdom of their Father&rdquo; (Matt. 13:43), &ldquo;the kingdom of My Father&rdquo; (26:29), &ldquo;the kingdom of Christ and of God&rdquo; (Eph. 5:5), and &ldquo;the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:11), and it will be a reward to the overcoming saints. The heavenly kingdom in 2 Timothy 4:18 equals the crown of righteousness in verse 8 and is an incentive to the believers who run the heavenly course.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that the kingdom of the heavens is wrapped up with the church. In Matthew 13 the Lord spoke concerning the revelation of the church with respect to the kingdom of the heavens. He also prophesied concerning the main points of Christian history between His first coming and His second coming.</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is also called the kingdom of God. It is in the section of God&rsquo;s kingdom where God reigns in a particular way, in the sense of life. At the beginning of the New Testament the kingdom of God was present, but it needed a new start in the way of life. According to the Gospel of Matthew there are three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens: the reality, the outward appearance, and the manifestation. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward content of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature. The outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward condition of the kingdom of the heavens in name. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the proper church life. The outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens includes false believers who are not regenerated. Both the reality and the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church today.</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens began on the day of Pentecost, beginning at the same time and going on in parallel with the church. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens was established with the sons of the kingdom, the wheat. They are the genuine believers regenerated by the divine life. The enemy, however, sowed tares, false believers, among the wheat, the genuine believers, to form an outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. The development of the outward appearance is like a mustard seed, the smallest among seeds, growing into a tree. When thousands of false believers entered into the church, the world was mixed with the church. With its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled as a tree on the earth, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches in which many evil persons and things are lodged. The Lord used the parable of the leaven to prophesy concerning the corruption of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. The church must be a loaf of unleavened bread. However, the Roman Catholic Church, which was fully and officially formed in the sixth century, took in many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ, leavening the whole content of Christianity. The outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens exists along with the church in the church age and will continue until the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, that is, the manifestation of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. The outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens will be burned away. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens will be transferred into the next age to become the manifestation of the kingdom. The manifestation of the kingdom is the kingdom of the Father, the heavenly part of the millennium; it will be a reward to the overcoming saints.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The church is the mystery of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. This mystery was hidden throughout the ages in God, who created all things. It was not made known in the Old Testament times to the sons of men. However, the church as a mystery has been revealed to the New Testament believers, and many prophecies concerning the church are recorded in the New Testament. In this lesson we will see the prophecies concerning the building up of the church and the stages of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I will build My church.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s word here is a prophecy that concerns practice; it is a prophecy concerning the building up of the church. Twenty centuries have passed since the Lord spoke this word, but the building up of the church has not been completed. Therefore, up to this day Matthew 16:18 remains a great prophecy yet to be fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Beginning at Pentecost</h2>
<p>The building up of the church began at Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4, 41-42). At the first Pentecost after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, the compound Spirit was poured out upon those who called on the Lord&rsquo;s name, as prophesied in Joel 2:28-29, and the church was produced (Acts 2:16-18). Before that time there were only the Jews and the Gentiles, but through the Triune God pouring Himself out, the church was produced (1 Cor. 10:32).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Prophecy concerning<br />
the Building Up of the Church in Ephesians 4</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:13 Paul says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; Then in verse 16 he says, &ldquo;Out from whom [Christ, the Head of the Body] all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; These verses are Paul&rsquo;s prophecy concerning the building up of the church and are a continuation of the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy in Matthew 16:18. This prophecy is being fulfilled in the church age. Without the fulfillment of this prophecy and without the church being built up, the Lord does not have a way to come back. Believers should yearn to see the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy concerning the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE STAGES OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are prophecies concerning the stages of the church (1:3-4). Seven is the number for completion in God&rsquo;s operation. Hence, seven churches signify the complete stages of the church. In His sovereignty God specifically chose seven churches among the churches existing in Asia at that time to apply these prophecies so that they would accurately represent all churches, thereby making known His purpose throughout the ages for the church. Therefore, these seven epistles are not merely a record of the actual situation existing in the seven churches at the time these epistles were written (vv. 19-20), but they also contain signs with a prophetic nature, prophetically signifying the seven stages of the church. Even though what is recorded in these seven epistles has become history, the seven epistles were prophecies at the time John wrote the book of Revelation. In these seven epistles the Lord repeatedly proclaims that He will come quickly, without explicitly indicating that the seven epistles are stages of church history because He wants the believers to be watchful (Mark 13:35) and not settle in the world and thus lose the nature of being a sojourner on the earth and the hope of the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Church in Ephesus&mdash;<br />
the Church at the End of the Initial Stage</h2>
<p>The first epistle was to the church in Ephesus (Rev. 2:1-7). It provides a picture of the church at the end of the initial stage, during the last part of the first century. The word <em>Ephesus</em> in Greek means &ldquo;desirable.&rdquo; This signifies that the initial church at its end was still desirable to the Lord; the Lord still had much expectation in her.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Having Works, Labor, and Endurance<br />
and Having Tried the False Apostles</h2>
<p>The church in Ephesus had works, labor, endurance, and much discernment, being able to try the false apostles and to reject them (v. 2). These false apostles were those whom Paul referred to in 2 Corinthians 11:13, which says, &ldquo;Such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ.&rdquo; The last time Paul met with the elders of the church in Ephesus, he told the elders to beware of these persons, saying, &ldquo;I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them&rdquo; (Acts 20:29-30). Because the apostleship is very important in the Lord&rsquo;s church, unlawful ones pretend to be apostles.</p>
<p>False apostles were already present before the apostles passed away. After the apostles&rsquo; departure, there were even more false apostles. At the end of the initial stage of the church, false apostles were not accepted by the believers. The church in Ephesus tried those who called themselves apostles and were not and found them to be false. The trying of the false apostles, together with their works, labor, and endurance were all approved by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Having Left the First Love toward the Lord</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that the church, as the bride of Christ (John 3:29), is a matter of love. In his Epistle to the church in Ephesus Paul prays for the saints to be strengthened that they might be rooted and grounded in love to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ (3:16-19). He also says, &ldquo;Peace to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility&rdquo; (6:23-24). However, in the epistle to the church in Ephesus in the book of Revelation, the Lord rebuked them for having left their first love (2:4). According to <em>The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles,</em> an ancient book written approximately ten or twenty years after the writing of Revelation, the church at the end of the initial stage still held the pure faith and hoped for the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, but she had left her first love toward the Lord. A sentence in the book says, &ldquo;If you have wealth, give with your own hands, that your soul may have its ransom.&rdquo; This refers to the giving of wealth as payment for sins; it does not refer to the Lord&rsquo;s redeeming blood. What a degradation! Hence, the Lord admonished the church in Ephesus to &ldquo;remember therefore where you have fallen from and repent and do the first works&rdquo;; otherwise, the Lord would come to her and would remove her lampstand out of its place unless she repented (v. 5).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Hating the Works of the Nicolaitans</h2>
<p>The church in Ephesus hated the works of the Nicolaitans, which the Lord also hated (v. 6). <em>Nicolaos</em> is composed of two words, one meaning &ldquo;conquer or be victorious over&rdquo; and another meaning &ldquo;common people, secular people, or laity.&rdquo; Thus, it means conquering the common people, being victorious over the laity. Therefore, Nicolaitans must refer to a group of people who esteem themselves higher than common believers. According to church history at the end of the initial stage, the Nicolaitans intervened among the saints, producing two classes: the clergy and the laity. This system was gradually adopted by the Roman Catholic Church and has been retained by the Protestant churches. Today the priestly system of the Roman Catholic Church, the clerical system of the state churches, and the pastoral system of the independent churches are a mediatorial class that spoils the universal priesthood of all believers in the proper church life (1:6; 5:10; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9).</p>
<p>In the second century Ignatius wrote to the church in Ephesus, saying, &ldquo;It is very obvious that as we honor the Lord Himself, we should also honor the bishop [i.e., overseer].&rdquo; The word <em>bishop</em> here is singular. According to the New Testament revelation, an overseer in a local church is an elder (Acts 20:17, 28). Two titles refer to the same person&mdash;<em>elder,</em> denoting a person of maturity, and <em>overseer,</em> denoting the function of an elder. However, Ignatius taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder. This erroneous teaching was the source of the episcopal system of ecclesiastical government from which came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope in the Roman Catholic Church. In the Lord&rsquo;s eyes these are the works of the Nicolaitans and are abominable. The church in Ephesus hated what the Lord hated. They sympathized with the Lord and were truly pleasing to Him.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Church in Smyrna&mdash;<br />
the Suffering under the Persecution <br />
of the Roman Empire</h2>
<p>The second epistle was written to the church in Smyrna (Rev. 2:8-11). In Greek <em>Smyrna</em> means &ldquo;myrrh,&rdquo; which in typology signifies the sweet suffering of Christ. Thus, the church in Smyrna was a suffering church, prefiguring the church under the persecution of the Roman Empire from the latter part of the first century to the early part of the fourth century. The persecuted church suffered in the sweetness and fragrance of Christ, that is, in the tribulation of Jesus and in the fellowship of His sufferings, and thereby became the continuation of His suffering (Col. 1:24).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Suffering the Slander of the Jews</h2>
<p>During the period prefigured by the church in Smyrna, there were Jews outside the church who were persecuting the church. The Lord said that they &ldquo;call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan&rdquo; (Rev. 2:9). They were Jews only in the flesh, not Jews in spirit (Rom. 2:28-29). They joined hands with the Gentiles who persecuted the church to persecute the believers by driving them out of the synagogues, casting them into prison (Rev. 2:10), preventing a supply of material needs to them, and even killing them. Furthermore, at that time there were also Judaizers within the church such as the Nazaraeans and Ebionites, who were Judaic Christians. These Judaizers stubbornly insisted on keeping their Judaistic system, consisting of the Levitical priesthood, the sacrificial rituals, and the material temple. Under Satan&rsquo;s manipulating, maneuvering hand, the Jewish synagogues opposed the Lord Jesus (Matt. 12:9-14; Luke 4:28-29; John 9:22), the apostles (Acts 13:43, 45-46, 50; 14:1-2, 19; 17:1, 5-6), and the churches (Rev. 2:9). Hence, the Lord called the Jews, in particular the Judaizers, &ldquo;a synagogue of Satan.&rdquo; The overcoming church must not care about the slander of the Judaizers nor for any religious systems or ways but simply pursue and follow the Lord in spirit and in life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Suffering the Persecution of the Roman Empire</h2>
<p>The Lord also prophesied that the church in Smyrna would have &ldquo;tribulation for ten days&rdquo; (v. 10). Ten is a number of fullness. Ten days signify a period of time that is full yet brief (Gen. 24:55; Jer. 42:7; Dan. 1:12-14). Here it signifies that the affliction of the suffering church was full yet short-lived. As a sign, ten days indicate prophetically the ten periods of persecution that the church suffered under the Roman emperors, beginning with Caesar Nero in the second half of the first century and ending with Constantine the Great in A.D. 313, when he decreed the edict at Milan that proclaimed freedom of religion. These two hundred years were a period of martyrdom of the church. Severe persecutions were continuously instigated by the devil, Satan, through the Roman Caesars, who did their utmost to destroy and eliminate the church. However, they could not subdue and terminate the church. Although the believers suffered afflictions, they were faithful unto death and were more than victorious by the resurrection life. The Lord also promised them, &ldquo;Do not fear the things that you are about to suffer...Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life&rdquo; (Rev. 2:10). History demonstrates that the church of the living Christ, who became dead and lived again, withstood the persecutions victoriously and multiplied flourishingly by the indestructible resurrection life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Church in Pergamos&mdash;<br />
the Worldly Church</h2>
<p>The third epistle was written to the church in Pergamos (vv. 12-17). The Greek word <em>Pergamos</em> means &ldquo;marriage,&rdquo; implying union, and &ldquo;fortified tower.&rdquo; The church in Pergamos prefigures the worldly church that entered into a marriage union with the world. It lasted from the time that Constantine the Great accepted Christianity to the latter part of the sixth century when the papal system was established.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being in Union with the World<br />
and Becoming a Fortified Tower</h2>
<p>According to church history, in the first three centuries Satan tried his best to damage the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire. Eventually, Satan&rsquo;s persecution caused the church to multiply flourishingly. Therefore, Satan in his subtlety changed his strategy from persecuting the church to welcoming her. In the early part of the fourth century, Constantine the Great accepted Christianity. Initially, many of Constantine&rsquo;s soldiers were Christians. Thus, when he conquered Rome and became the emperor, he accepted Christianity as the legitimate state religion. His motive was a political one, because his goal was to prevent his country from falling into confusion because of religious issues. The welcoming of the church by the Roman Empire caused the church to become worldly. Such a union of the church with the world is considered spiritual fornication in the eyes of God. Furthermore, through Constantine&rsquo;s encouragement and political influence, multitudes of unbelievers were baptized into the church, and the church became monstrously great. Constantine also made use of his royal position to promote Christianity. By the end of the fourth century, Christianity was officially made the state religion of the Roman Empire, obtaining a prestigious position and becoming a fortified tower. According to the prophecies in Matthew 13:31-33, like a mustard seed that grew into a great tree and like fine flour that was leavened, the church with its changed nature has become a huge organization&mdash;Christendom.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Holding Fast the Lord&rsquo;s Name and<br />
Not Denying the Lord&rsquo;s Faith</h2>
<p>The church in Pergamos still held fast the Lord&rsquo;s name, the reality of the person of Christ. According to history, the church at that time was still orthodox. This was the time of the first Nicene Council in A.D. 325. The church still adhered to the faith of the Triune God, believing in the Lord&rsquo;s divinity and humanity and opposing the heresy of Arianism, which denied the divinity of Christ. The church still held fast the Lord&rsquo;s name and did not deny the Lord&rsquo;s faith amidst difficult circumstances. This was known to the Lord and approved by Him (Rev. 2:13).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Dwelling Where Satan&rsquo;s Throne Is</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, when speaking to the church in Pergamos, the Lord said, &ldquo;I know where you dwell, where Satan&rsquo;s throne is&rdquo; (v. 13). Satan&rsquo;s dwelling place is the world. Because the church entered into union with the world and became worldly, she began to dwell where Satan dwells&mdash;in the world. The dwelling place of the church in Pergamos was where Satan&rsquo;s throne is. This indicates that the church at that time was in the sphere of Satan&rsquo;s rule. For example, at the Nicene Council Constantine the Great utilized his imperial authority to eliminate contentions and to establish the creed. Customs, power, and authorities of the world were brought into the church, and this interfered with the administration and the faith of the church and manipulated God&rsquo;s serving ones. As a result, the church began to rely on worldly power and thus lost her heavenly position and status as well as her spiritual nature and content.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Holding the Teaching of Balaam and<br />
the Teaching of the Nicolaitans</h2>
<p>In His word to the church in Pergamos the Lord prophesied that the church that entered into union with the world would hold the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans (vv. 14-15). Balaam was a Gentile prophet who caused God&rsquo;s people to stumble. For the sake of reward (2 Pet. 2:15; Jude 11), he enticed God&rsquo;s people into fornication and idolatry (Num. 25:1-3; 31:16). Balaam&rsquo;s teaching turned the worldly church to idolatry, which issued in fornication. The teaching of the Nicolaitans, that is, the teaching of hierarchy, destroys the function of the believers as members of the Body of Christ, thus annulling the Lord&rsquo;s Body as His expression.</p>
<p>After the church entered into union with the world, she began to accept many heathen ceremonies and festivals, such as worshipping Mary, worshipping angels and ancient saints, being superstitious concerning holy communion, and celebrating Christmas. All these became part of Christian worship and Christian festivals. Due to the teaching of the Nicolaitans, the church also began to have a hierarchy to rule over the laity. Those who were wise, capable, and powerful were elected to be leaders. Thus, the church, having changed in nature, became organized like a worldly organization. The genuine church life as revealed in the New Testament, however, always holds and enjoys Christ as the unique person. Moreover, the church is not a human organization but an organism with all the members functioning according to life so that the Body of Christ may be built up. Hence, the Lord warned the church in Pergamos that she needed to repent. But if she would not repent, He would come to her quickly and would make war with them with the sword of His mouth (Rev. 2:16).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The building up of the church remains a great prophecy yet to be fulfilled. The building up of the church began at Pentecost, and this prophecy is being fulfilled in the church age. Believers should yearn to see the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy concerning the building of the church.</p>
<p>The seven epistles written to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are a prophecy of the stages of the church. The first epistle to the church in Ephesus provides a picture of the church at the end of the initial stage during the last part of the first century. At the end of the initial stage the church was able to try false apostles. The works, labor, and endurance of the initial church were approved by the Lord. The church in Ephesus also hated the works of the Nicolaitans, which the Lord also hated. But they left their first love toward the Lord.</p>
<p>The church in Smyrna prefigures the suffering church under the persecution of the Roman Empire from the latter part of the first century to the early part of the fourth century. The persecuted church was the continuation of Christ&rsquo;s suffering. They were slandered by the Jews and persecuted by the Roman Empire, but the church of the living Christ, who became dead and lived again, withstood the persecution victoriously and multiplied flourishingly by the indestructible resurrection life.</p>
<p>The church in Pergamos prefigures the worldly church, which lasted from the time that Constantine the Great accepted Christianity to the latter part of the sixth century when the papal system was established. The worldly church entered into union with the world and became a fortified tower. Although they held fast the Lord&rsquo;s name and did not deny the Lord&rsquo;s faith, the Lord rebuked them for dwelling where Satan&rsquo;s throne is and for holding the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans. Hence, the Lord warned the church in Pergamos that she needed to repent. If she did not repent, He promised to come to her quickly and make war with her with the sword of His mouth.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue to see the prophecies in Revelation chapters 2 and 3 concerning the stages of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Church in Thyatira&mdash;<br />
the Apostate Church</h2>
<p>The fourth epistle in Revelation, to the church in Thyatira, prophetically describes the apostate Roman Catholic Church, from the establishment of the papal system in the latter part of the sixth century to Christ&rsquo;s coming at the end of this age (2:18-29). <em>Thyatira</em> in Greek means &ldquo;sacrifice of perfume,&rdquo; or &ldquo;unceasing sacrifice.&rdquo; This apostate church is full of sacrifices, as demonstrated in her unceasing mass.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Doing Many Works</h2>
<p>To the church in Thyatira the Lord said, &ldquo;I know your works and love and faith and service and your endurance and that your last works are more than the first&rdquo; (v. 19). This prophesies that the apostate church has many works and services, and her works in the last days are even more than those in the past. According to church history, in the Middle Ages the majority in the Roman Catholic Church were apostate and disapproved by the Lord, but there were still many faithful ones among them. They were &ldquo;the rest in Thyatira&rdquo; (v. 24), who rejected heresies to the uttermost, faithfully loved the Lord, and were willing to suffer for the Lord. They did not have the evil teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, nor did they know the deep things of Satan. Their works, love, faith, service, and endurance were acknowledged and approved by the Lord. Thus, the Lord reminded them, &ldquo;Nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come&rdquo; (v. 25).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Tolerating the Prophetess Jezebel&mdash;Allowing Her to Teach and Lead the Lord&rsquo;s Slaves Astray<br />
to Commit Fornication and to Eat Idol Sacrifices</h2>
<p>The Lord rebuked the church in Thyatira for tolerating Jezebel, the woman who called herself a prophetess and taught the Lord&rsquo;s slaves to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices (v. 20). The prophetess Jezebel referred to in this prophecy was the pagan wife of Ahab, the king of Israel (1 Kings 16:31). She urged Ahab to worship and to serve Baal, promoted idolatry among the children of Israel, and sought to kill the prophets of the children of Israel (21:25-26; 18:19; 19:2). Jezebel is also the woman prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33, the woman who added leaven&mdash;signifying evil, heretical, and pagan things&mdash;into the fine flour&mdash;signifying Christ as the meal offering for the satisfaction of God and man. She is also the great harlot in Revelation 17 who mixes abominations with the divine things.</p>
<p>According to church history Jezebel the prophetess, as prophesied in Revelation 2, is undoubtedly the apostate church, the Roman Catholic Church. On the one hand, the apostate church mixes heathen, pagan things with the worship of God by His people. She helps God&rsquo;s people to worship God, but she does not do it in God&rsquo;s way; rather, she does it in a heathen, pagan way. The Roman Catholic Church has leavened everything related to Christ. The Roman Catholic Church does have Christ, the fine flour, but she has put leaven into the fine flour, thereby fulfilling the prophecy of Matthew 13:33, &ldquo;the whole was leavened.&rdquo; On the other hand, the apostate Roman Catholic Church is also a self-appointed prophetess, a person who presumes to be authorized by God to speak for God. She demands people to listen to her more than to God. Her adherents are drugged by her heretical, religious teachings and thus do not care for Christ as their life and life supply (Rev. 2:7, 17).</p><h2 class="head3">3. Not Willing to Repent and Being Sick in Bed</h2>
<p>The apostate church in Thyatira is not willing to repent, and the Lord causes her to be sick in bed (vv. 21-22). This indicates that the apostate church is incurably sick and will remain so until the judgment at the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Those Committing Adultery with Her <br />
Suffering Tribulation, and <br />
Her Children Being Killed with Death</h2>
<p>The Lord said to the apostate church, &ldquo;Behold, I cast...those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works; and her children I will kill with death&rdquo; (vv. 22-23). Tribulation here is the particular portion of affliction that the Lord will cause the Roman Catholic Church to suffer when He judges her. To kill her children with death may refer to the destroying of the Roman Catholic Church by Antichrist and his followers during the three and a half years of the great tribulation (17:16-17; 19:1-3). By this the churches will know that the Lord is He who searches the inward parts and the hearts (2:23).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Church in Sardis&mdash;<br />
the Reformed Church</h2>
<p>The fifth epistle was written to the church in Sardis (3:1-6). In Greek <em>Sardis</em> means &ldquo;the remains, the remainder,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the restoration.&rdquo; The epistle to the church in Sardis is a prophecy concerning the Protestant church from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ. According to church history the Reformation in the sixteenth century was a reaction to the apostate Roman Catholic Church, signified by the degraded church in Thyatira. The Reformation was accomplished by a minority of believers, the remainder. Hence, it was a restoration by the remainder. What the church in Sardis signifies is the Protestant church produced after the Reformation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Living in Name but Being Dead</h2>
<p>The Lord said to the messenger of the church in Sardis, &ldquo;I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead&rdquo; (v. 1). The Reformation was the direct work of the Holy Spirit, but the Protestant church after the Reformation is a human organization. The Protestant church is considered by many to be living, but the Lord says that she is dead. Hence, she needs the living seven Spirits and the shining seven stars (v. 1) to recover from the condition of having lost her power and life. The Protestant denominations seem to be better than the Roman Catholic Church prefigured by the church in Thyatira, but they have lost the vitality of life and are living in name only. The frequent revivals in the history of the Protestant denominations are a proof of their being dead.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Things Which Remain Being About to Die</h2>
<p>In Revelation 3:2 the Lord asked the church in Sardis to &ldquo;establish the things which remain, which were about to die.&rdquo; The things which remain are the things that were lost and then restored by the Reformation, such as justification by faith, the gospel of grace, and the open Bible. Although these things were restored during the Reformation, they were about to die. Hence, they needed to be revived.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Having No Work Completed</h2>
<p>The Lord also said, &ldquo;I have found none of your works completed before My God&rdquo; (v. 2b). Nothing that began in the Reformation has ever been completed by the Protestant churches. In the eyes of God there are no completed works in the so-called reformed churches. Even though they recovered the open Bible and gained many precious truths, they still hold on to their creeds and rituals. They left the organization of the Roman Catholic Church, but they produced many more state churches, which are joined to politics, and independent churches, which uphold partial truths; they have not returned to the proper ground of the church as revealed in the Bible. Hence, even though many servants among them have been greatly used by the Lord, their works are not complete in God&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Lord charged them, &ldquo;Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent. If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you&rdquo; (v. 3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Church in Philadelphia&mdash;<br />
the Church of Brotherly Love</h2>
<p>The sixth epistle was written to the church in Philadelphia (vv. 7-13). <em>Philadelphia</em> in Greek means &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo; The church in Philadelphia prophetically depicts the church of brotherly love, that is, the recovery of the proper church life. The church of brotherly love was a reaction to the dead, reformed church. It started in the early part of the nineteenth century, when the brothers were raised up in England to practice the church life outside the system of sects and divisions, and it will continue until the Lord comes back.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Keeping the Lord&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<p>One outstanding feature of the church in Philadelphia is that she has a little power and has kept the Lord&rsquo;s word (v. 8). According to church history the brothers raised up in the early part of the nineteenth century did not care for tradition; they strictly kept the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Not Denying the Lord&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>In Revelation 3:8 the Lord also said that the church in Philadelphia did not deny His name. The brothers raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century did not take any name other than the Lord&rsquo;s name. They called themselves Christians only, that is, those belonging to Christ. They not only returned in a full way to the Lord&rsquo;s word but also abandoned all names other than that of the Lord Jesus Christ. They belonged to the Lord absolutely, having nothing to do with any denominations (any names). The church, as the pure virgin espoused to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2), should have no name other than her husband&rsquo;s. All other names are an abomination in the eyes of God. By taking names other than the Lord&rsquo;s name, the Protestant church has committed spiritual fornication. Deviation from the Word to heresies and the exaltation of so many names other than that of Christ are the most striking signs of degraded Christianity. Returning to the pure Word from all heresies and traditions and the exaltation of the Lord&rsquo;s name by abandoning every other name are the most inspiring testimonies in the church of brotherly love. In the church in Philadelphia there is only the pure word of the Lord and His unique name.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being Given an Opened Door</h2>
<p>In Revelation 3:8 the Lord said, &ldquo;I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut.&rdquo; The Lord is the One who has the key of David and who opens a door which no one will shut (v. 7). He has given to the church in Philadelphia an opened door which no one can shut. Since the recovery of the proper church life began in the early part of the nineteenth century until now, a door has always been opened to the recovered church all over the world. There is no way for organized Christianity to shut this door because the key is in the hands of Christ, the Head of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Having the Promise of<br />
Being Kept out of the Hour of Trial, Which Is About to Come on the Whole Inhabited Earth</h2>
<p>The Lord promised the church in Philadelphia: &ldquo;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth&rdquo; (v. 10). <em>Trial</em> in this verse undoubtedly denotes the great tribulation, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth (Matt. 24:21). Hence, this promise refers to the rapture of the overcomers before the great tribulation. Since the church in Philadelphia has kept the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance, the Lord promises to keep her out of the hour of trial; that is, she will be raptured before the great tribulation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Church in Laodicea&mdash;<br />
the Degraded Recovered Church</h2>
<p>The seventh epistle was written to the church in Laodicea (Rev. 3:14-22). As a sign, the church in Laodicea prophetically signifies the degraded recovered church. Less than a century after the Lord recovered the proper church in the early part of the nineteenth century, some of the recovered &ldquo;assemblies&rdquo; (called such by the Brethren) became degraded. The degraded recovered church, signified by the church in Laodicea, will exist until the Lord comes back.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Full of Human Opinion</h2>
<p><em>Laodicea</em> means &ldquo;the opinion, judgment, of the people&rdquo; or &ldquo;of the laymen.&rdquo; This indicates that the degraded recovered church is full of human opinion. Christ is the Head of the church, His Body, and the believers are the members of the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23; Col. 1:18; 1 Cor. 12:27). When the recovered church no longer holds Christ as the Head, no longer receives the discipline of the Holy Spirit, no longer remains in the position of brothers, and no longer honors God&rsquo;s word but instead does things according to fleshly human opinion, she becomes Laodicea in her degradation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Neither Cold nor Hot</h2>
<p>The Lord rebuked the church in Laodicea, saying, &ldquo;I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot. So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of My mouth&rdquo; (Rev. 3:15-16). Even though the degraded recovered church is living, she is not burning. She pursues spiritual knowledge but has lost her zeal toward the Lord. Dead, vain knowledge and doctrinal forms have made the degraded recovered church neither cold nor hot. Being neither cold nor hot, the degraded church is in danger of being spewed out of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth, that is, losing the enjoyment of all that the Lord is to His church. Hence, she needs to repent of her lukewarmness and be zealous, boiling, burning, that she may regain her enjoyment of the reality of Christ (v. 19).</p><h2 class="head3">3. Thinking That She Is Rich,<br />
but Not Knowing That She Is Wretched, Miserable, Poor, Blind, and Naked</h2>
<p>The church in Laodicea thinks that she is rich (v. 17). According to church history the degraded recovered assemblies boast of their spiritual riches, thinking that they are rich and thus are in spiritual pride. However, in the eyes of the Lord they are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked (v. 17). They boast of their riches in doctrines and knowledge but are poor in the experience of Christ. They care mainly for vain knowledge but scarcely care for the living experience of Christ. This is real poverty; it is the poverty that makes the degraded recovered church wretched and miserable. Besides, even though the church in Laodicea has some amount of knowledge about spiritual things, she does not have true spiritual insight. Thus, she is blind in genuine spiritual things. She is naked, mainly due to the lack of the subjective experience of Christ, that is, the lack of living by Christ and living out Christ to be her subjective righteousness as another splendid robe.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Keeping the Lord outside Her Door</h2>
<p>The Lord said to the church in Laodicea, &ldquo;Behold, I stand at the door and knock&rdquo; (v. 20). This door is not the door of the gospel but of the church. The Lord as the Head of the church is standing outside the degraded church, knocking at her door. This shows that the degraded recovered church in reality is Christless. This church has some knowledge and has the name of Christ, but there are too many objective doctrines and too little subjective truths. Hence, she does not have the subjective presence of Christ. The Lord desires that she open the door: &ldquo;If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me&rdquo; (v. 20). The Lord desires that all the objective doctrines of the church in Laodicea would become subjective experiences so that she can dine with Him, that is, to have intimate fellowship and joy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word to the church in Thyatira is a prophecy concerning the apostate Roman Catholic Church, which began with the establishment of the papal system in the latter part of the sixth century and will continue to Christ&rsquo;s coming at the end of this age. The apostate church has works, love, faith, service, and endurance, and her last works are more than the first. But she mixes heathen, pagan things with the worship of God by His people. She is also a self-appointed prophetess, one who presumes to be authorized by God to speak for God. Those who commit adultery with her will suffer tribulation, and her children will be killed with death. Since the apostate church is not willing to repent of her adultery, the Lord causes her to be sick in bed until the judgment at the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word to the church in Sardis is a prophecy concerning the reformed church, which is the Protestant church from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ. She has a name that she is living, and yet she is dead. Many things were recovered in the Reformation, such as justification by faith, the gospel of grace, and the open Bible. However, these restored things were about to die and needed to be revived. Furthermore, in the eyes of God there are no completed works in the so-called reformed church. Therefore, the Lord charged her, &ldquo;Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent&rdquo; (3:3).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word to the church in Philadelphia prophetically depicts the church of brotherly love, that is, the recovery of the proper church life, which began in the early part of the nineteenth century when brothers were raised up in England to practice the church life outside the system of sects and divisions and continues until the Lord comes back.

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>It has been nearly two thousand years since the church was established. The seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 clearly and accurately prophesy the various stages of the church during these two thousand years as well as in the future. In this lesson we shall see the prophecies concerning the consummation of the church as God&rsquo;s ultimate purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PLAN BEING TO OBTAIN<br />
A COUNTERPART FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to obtain for Christ a counterpart&mdash;His church&mdash;through redemption and the divine life. According to the entire Bible there is a divine romance between the creating and redeeming God, typified by the male, and His redeemed people, typified by the female. This is a basic matter revealed in the Scriptures. In the Old Testament God told His redeemed people, Israel, that He was their Husband and that they were His wife (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:14; 31:32: Hosea 2:19). In the New Testament Christ is revealed as the Bridegroom coming for His bride, and this bride is the church (John 3:29). In Ephesians 5 Paul says that the wife is a type of the church, and the husband is a type of Christ. Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her (v. 25). Furthermore, Christ and the church will become one (vv. 31-32). In Revelation 19 the wife is the aggregate of the overcoming saints who will be married to Christ the Lamb and will enjoy the marriage dinner with Him (vv. 7-9). Ultimately, in Revelation 22:17 the New Jerusalem will be the aggregate of the Spirit, the consummated God, and His counterpart, the consummated church, to be the ultimate consummation of the divine romance as revealed in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being for Christ&rsquo;s Satisfaction and Rest in Love</h2>
<p>In His creation God first created a man (Gen. 2:7). But the man, Adam, did not find a helper as his counterpart (v. 20). In order to produce such a counterpart, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam. Then He took a rib out of Adam and built it into a woman, named Eve (vv. 21-23). Because Eve was the same as Adam in life, nature, and form, she could be his counterpart. This is a wonderful picture depicting Christ and the church, signifying that only the church, which has the same life and nature of Christ, can become Christ&rsquo;s counterpart for His satisfaction and rest in love.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being the Great Mystery</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 5:32 Paul says, &ldquo;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&rdquo; Christ and the church as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17), typified by a husband and wife as one flesh, are the great mystery. It surely is a great mystery that the church as Christ&rsquo;s counterpart comes out of Christ, has the same life and nature of Christ, and is one with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being the Increase of<br />
Christ the Bridegroom, the Husband</h2>
<p>In John 3:29 John the Baptist said, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ is the Bridegroom who comes for the bride. This also implies that the church should be a corporate bride prepared for Christ, enjoying Him as the pleasant Bridegroom. Paul in 2 Corinthians 11:2 says, &ldquo;I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.&rdquo; The church has been presented as a pure virgin to Christ, the unique Husband. She should belong only to Him, appreciate only Him, and love only Him. After John the Baptist referred to Christ as the Bridegroom, he went on to say, &ldquo;He must increase, but I must decrease&rdquo; (John 3:30). The increase in verse 30 is the bride in verse 29. For the Lord to increase means that He gains the bride. All those who believe into Him must follow Him, and all those who follow Him should become His bride to be His increase. As Eve was the increase of Adam, so the church as the bride, the wife, is the increase of Christ the Bridegroom, the Husband.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CHURCH BEING THE BRIDE OF CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Preparation of the Bride</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:26-27 reveals that today Christ is sanctifying the church, &ldquo;cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.&rdquo; Today Christ as the life-giving Spirit is sanctifying the church through separation, saturation, transformation, growth, and building up; in the future Christ as the Bridegroom will present the church to Himself as His counterpart for His satisfaction. This is the preparation of the bride. In Revelation 19:7 the voice of a great multitude says, &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; This indicates that the marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit throughout the centuries, the bride will be ready at the end of this age, and the marriage of the Lamb will come.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Readiness of the Bride <br />
Depending on the Maturity of the Overcomers</h2>
<p>When Christ comes back, He will marry the overcomers who represent all the saints in the church (vv. 7-9). For this reason, the readiness of the bride depends on the overcomers&rsquo; maturity in life. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.&rdquo; <em>Righteounesses</em> in this verse can also be translated as &ldquo;righteous acts,&rdquo; referring to the subjective righteousness of the overcoming saints, who form the wife in verse 7, that enables them to meet the requirement of the overcoming Christ. Hence, <em>fine linen</em> speaks of the overcoming living that is lived out by the believers&rsquo; overcoming life, which actually is Christ lived out of them. <em>Fine linen</em> in verse 8 is equivalent to the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11-12. According to the revelation of the Scriptures, the believers need two garments&mdash;one for salvation and one for preparation to be the bride. For their salvation, the believers need a robe to cover them. This robe is the robe put on the prodigal son in Luke 15:22, which signifies Christ as our righteousness for us to be justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30). However, the believers also need a second garment, which is the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11-12 and the garment of fine linen in Revelation 19:8, so that they may be qualified to attend the marriage dinner of the Lamb to be His bride. The second garment is the work of the Holy Spirit in the believers. It is the Christ whom they live and express in their daily living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. After the Marriage of the Lamb,<br />
the Church Being the Bride of Christ<br />
in the Millennium</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John reveals that Christ came as the Lamb to take away sin (1:29) and as the Bridegroom that He might have the bride (3:29). The book of Revelation prophesies that Christ is still the Lamb and the Bridegroom. This indicates that the goal of God&rsquo;s will is for Christ to have the bride. Revelation 19:7-8 speaks of Christ and His counterpart, His bride, getting married at His coming; this is the marriage of the Lamb. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; The bride is the overcoming believers in the millennium (vv. 8-9).</p>
<p>The future position of the overcoming believers is the bride, and the future position of Christ is the Bridegroom. The believers are on earth preparing to become the bride to meet Him, and Christ is on the throne in the third heaven preparing to come as the Bridegroom to meet His overcoming believers. He is coming as the Bridegroom, and the overcoming believers are going as the bride. When He comes back, Christ and His overcoming believers will meet, and that will be the wedding of Christ&rsquo;s marriage.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE CHURCH AS THE BRIDE CONSUMMATING<br />
IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:2 says, &ldquo;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&rdquo; This prophecy concerning the church as the counterpart of Christ will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth in eternity. The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints redeemed by God throughout the generations. She comes out of Christ and is prepared to be Christ&rsquo;s counterpart by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE WIFE OF CHRIST IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:9-10 says, &ldquo;Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb. And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.&rdquo; A bride is mainly for the wedding day, while a wife is for the entire life. The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium for one thousand years, which is like one day (2 Pet. 3:8), and will be the wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, to the ages of the ages without end. The bride in the millennium consists of the overcoming saints, whereas the bride in the new heaven and new earth is composed of all God&rsquo;s redeemed and regenerated sons (Rev. 21:7).</p>
<p>Revelation 22:17 says, &ldquo;The Spirit and the bride say, Come!&rdquo; Together as a couple, the Spirit and the bride say, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; This shows that at the end of the New Testament the One who has the bride is the Spirit. The Spirit is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God, and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man. The processed Triune God as the Spirit and the transformed tripartite man as the bride will become one and will speak as one person.</p>
<p>The Bible begins and ends with a marriage. The final marriage is the marriage of the processed, consummated, and dispensing Triune God as the Husband with the church as His bride. For eternity this universal couple will be the full manifestation of the Triune God expressed in all His glory. Hence, the consummation of the church will match the processed Triune God to be His complete expression and satisfaction for eternity. This is the conclusion of the New Testament and also of the entire Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to obtain for Christ a counterpart&mdash;His church&mdash;through redemption and the divine life. Only the church, which has the same life and nature that Christ has, can become Christ&rsquo;s counterpart for His satisfaction and rest in love. Christ and the church, which comes out of Christ, are one spirit as a husband and wife are one flesh. This is the great mystery. As Eve was the increase of Adam, so the church as the bride, the wife, is the increase of Christ as the Bridegroom, the Husband.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5 reveals that today Christ is sanctifying the church that He might present the church to Himself as His counterpart. This is the preparation of the bride. When Christ comes back, He will marry the overcomers, who represent all the saints in the church. Therefore, the readiness of the bride depends on the overcomers&rsquo; maturity in life. Christ and His counterpart, the bride, will be married at His coming; this is the marriage of the Lamb. After the Lamb&rsquo;s marriage, the church will be Christ&rsquo;s bride in the millennium.</p>
<p>The church as the bride will consummate in the New Jerusalem and will be the wife of Christ in eternity. This ultimate marriage is the marriage between the processed, consummated, and dispensing Triune God as the Husband and the church as His bride. This universal couple is the full manifestation of the Triune God expressed in all His glory for eternity.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Due to the fall, mankind&rsquo;s only expectation is death. All those who are apart from Christ have no hope and are without God in the world (Eph. 2:12). However, the believers&rsquo; life is full of hope, not only for the Lord&rsquo;s coming but also to be resurrected and to be raptured. When the Lord comes back, there will be resurrection and rapture, and He will set up His judgment seat in the air to judge His believers. Concerning the believers&rsquo; resurrection, rapture, and judgment in the future, the revelation in the New Testament is both clear and strong. In this lesson we shall see prophecies in the Bible concerning the believers&rsquo; resurrection, rapture, and judgment. All believers should be concerned with the truth revealed in these prophecies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE RESURRECTION OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The Christian life is closely related to resurrection. A believer experiences being raised up together with Christ at the time of his salvation; this is the resurrection of the spirit (John 5:25; Eph. 2:1, 5-6; Col. 2:13). Furthermore, a believer&rsquo;s hope for the future also depends on resurrection, that is, the resurrection of the body. Paul says, &ldquo;If it is only that we have hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most miserable&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:19). The Christian life is completely different from the life of fallen mankind, which is a life without hope. The hope of the Christian life depends on the resurrection brought in at the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Resurrection of Life</h2>
<p>John 5:28-29 says, &ldquo;Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice and will come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment.&rdquo; These verses reveal two kinds of physical resurrections. One is the resurrection of life, that is, the resurrection of the saved believers before the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; 1 Cor. 15:23, 52; 1 Thes. 4:16). All dead believers will be resurrected at the return of the Lord Jesus to enjoy eternal life. Hence, this resurrection is called the resurrection of life. The resurrection of judgment refers to the resurrection of the unbelievers after the millennium (Rev. 20:5, 12). All the dead unbelievers will be resurrected after the millennium to be judged at the great white throne and to be sentenced to eternal perdition (vv. 11-15). Hence, this resurrection is called the resurrection of judgment. The resurrection of the believers is the resurrection of life, not the resurrection of judgment.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Dead Believers Awaiting Resurrection<br />
in Paradise, Which Is in Hades</h2>
<p>Resurrection is mainly for the dead (those who are sleeping, John 11:11-14; 1 Thes. 4:13; 1 Cor. 11:30) in the Lord before His coming. Those who sleep in the Lord first go to Hades, the place where the souls and spirits of the dead are kept (Luke 16:22-23; Acts 2:27). Hades is divided into two sections: a pleasant section, where Abraham, Lazarus, and all saved saints are (Luke 16:22), and a section of torment, where the rich man and all the perished sinners are (vv. 23, 28). The two sections are cut off from each other by a gulf, a chasm (v. 26). The dead saints go to the pleasant section of Hades. Their soul and spirit will be united with their resurrected body at the time of resurrection (1 Cor. 15:53; 1 Thes. 4:16). The overcomers will be resurrected and raptured before the great tribulation. Those who remain will be resurrected at the end of the great tribulation and will be raptured with the believers who are living at that time (v. 17). The dead unbelievers will go to the section of torment in Hades. They will be resurrected after the millennium to receive the judgment of the great white throne.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Out-resurrection Being a Reward to<br />
the Dead Overcomers through All the Generations</h2>
<p>All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from the dead at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. But the overcoming ones among them will enjoy an extra, outstanding portion of that resurrection. This is the out-resurrection referred to by Paul in Philippians 3:11 and the better resurrection in Hebrews 11:35. The better resurrection is the out-resurrection, the extra-resurrection. This means that the better resurrection is different from a common resurrection. Revelation 20:4-5 says, &ldquo;They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years...This is the first resurrection.&rdquo; <em>First</em> here can also be translated as &ldquo;best.&rdquo; The first resurrection is the best resurrection; it is also the resurrection of reward (Luke 14:14), that is, the better resurrection and the out-resurrection. This resurrection is a resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers, which enables them to reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom. Hence, blessed and holy are they who have part in the first resurrection (Rev. 20:6). They will inherit the kingdom of God manifested on earth and even be co-kings in it.</p>
<p>Those who participate in the out-resurrection include not only the overcomers who are resurrected from the dead, such as the man-child in Revelation 12:5 and the late martyrs in 15:2, but also the raptured living overcomers, such as the firstfruits in 14:1-5. The believers should aspire to obtain the best resurrection, the out-resurrection, as the goal and destination of their Christian life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Majority of Believers Who Died<br />
through All the Generations Being Resurrected</h2>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 4:16 Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord Himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.&rdquo; The trumpet of God refers to the last trumpet, the seventh trumpet (Rev. 11:15; 1 Cor. 15:52). First Corinthians 15:52 indicates that at the last trumpet the dead will be raised incorruptible. The majority of the believers, who died through all the generations, will be resurrected at the end of the great tribulation and will be raptured to the air with the believers living on the earth to meet the Lord (1 Thes. 4:17).</p>
<p>The parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25:1-12 also describes the resurrection of the majority of the believers who died through all the generations. The ten virgins in this parable signify the majority of the believers. Believers are like chaste virgins, bearing the Lord&rsquo;s testimony (the lamp) in the dark age and going out of the world to meet the Lord, the coming Bridegroom. &ldquo;While the bridegroom delayed, they all became drowsy and slept&rdquo; (v. 5). Becoming drowsy signifies becoming sick (Acts 9:37; 1 Cor. 11:30), and going to sleep signifies dying (1 Thes. 4:13-16; John 11:11-13). This indicates that while the Lord delays His return, the majority of the believers first become sick and then die. Matthew 25:6 continues, &ldquo;But at midnight there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him!&rdquo; This signifies that at the darkest time of this dark age (night), which will be at the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation, there will be a shout of command with the voice of the archangel (1 Thes. 4:16). Matthew 25:7 says, &ldquo;Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their own lamps.&rdquo; <em>Arose</em> signifies resurrection from the dead (1 Thes. 4:14). This is the resurrection of the majority of the believers who died through all the generations, as prophesied in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and I Corinthians 15:52.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE RAPTURE OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The subject of the believers&rsquo; rapture is a great matter in the Bible. Although the term <em>rapture</em> is not found in the Bible, the thought is strongly emphasized. Objectively speaking, to be raptured is to be taken, such as Enoch and Elijah, who were taken by God in the Old Testament (Gen. 5:24; 2 Kings 2:1, 11). This matter is also repeatedly spoken of in the New Testament, referring to the believers being taken by God (Matt. 24:40-41; Luke 17:34-36; 21:36; 1 Thes. 4:17; Rev. 3:10; 7:9; 11:12; 12:5; 14:1; 15:2). Subjectively speaking, to be raptured is for the believers to experience the redemption of the body, that is, to be glorified&mdash;the ultimate step of God&rsquo;s full salvation in life. At that time God will transfigure the believer&rsquo;s body of humiliation to be conformed to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory (Phil. 3:20-21). Hence, the rapture of the believers is not only to be raptured to the air; it is also to be taken with the transfiguration of the body through the life that emerges from within the believer and swallows up his mortal body (1 Cor. 15:50-54).</p>
<p>According to the New Testament all believers, whether living or dead, will be raptured at the Lord&rsquo;s coming. The dead and resurrected overcomers and the living mature believers will be raptured before the three and a half years of the great tribulation. The living immature believers who remain will pass through the great tribulation and will be raptured with the other resurrected believers close to the end of the great tribulation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being before the Great Tribulation</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Dead Overcomers<br />
Being Raptured to God&rsquo;s Throne<br />
in the Third Heaven</h2>
<p>Revelation 12:5 says, &ldquo;She brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.&rdquo; In the Bible a woman signifies the weaker vessel and a man the stronger vessel (1 Pet. 3:7). Hence, the man-child in Revelation 12:5 signifies the stronger part of God&rsquo;s people. The words <em>unto death</em> in verse 11 show that the strong man-child is composed of the dead and resurrected overcoming saints. Abel, who was the first martyr, the apostles, and all the martyrs and deceased overcomers are waiting for the time of resurrection. Their resurrection will be the delivery of the man-child (cf. Acts 13:33-34). They will be raptured to God and to His throne (Rev. 12:5) before the three and a half years, that is, before the twelve hundred sixty days, of the great tribulation (v. 6). Then they will execute the Lord&rsquo;s judgment on the devil, God&rsquo;s enemy, casting him out of heaven (vv. 7-11), and shepherd all the nations with an iron rod (12:5; 2:26-27).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Living Mature Believers<br />
Being Raptured to the Heavenly Mount Zion</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:1 says, &ldquo;I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.&rdquo; The second half of verse 4 goes on to explain, &ldquo;These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.&rdquo; The one hundred and forty-four thousand firstfruits will be raptured before the great tribulation (vv. 1-5) and will stand on the heavenly Mount Zion with Christ the Lamb (v. 1; Heb. 12:22). God&rsquo;s people are His crop (cf. 1 Cor. 3:9; Matt. 9:37-38; Luke 10:2; John 4:35). The firstfruits are those of God&rsquo;s crop who ripen the earliest. Hence, they will be reaped before the harvest, that is, raptured to the heavens before the rapture of the majority of the believers (Rev. 14:14-16), just as the firstfruits of the good land were reaped and brought into the temple of God for God&rsquo;s fresh enjoyment before the harvest (Lev. 23:10-11; Exo. 23:19). The firstfruits are not for fighting but for the satisfaction of God and of the Lamb. God and the Lamb need enjoyment. The living overcomers will be the firstfruits to satisfy this need for enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Rest of the Living Overcomers Being Raptured to Christ&rsquo;s Presence</h2>
<p>The living overcomers who will be raptured before the great tribulation also include the overcomers signified by the man and the woman who are taken in Matthew 24:40-41: &ldquo;At that time two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left.&rdquo; Furthermore, Luke 17:34 says, &ldquo;In that night there will be two on one bed; the one will be taken and the other will be left.&rdquo; To be taken in these Scriptures refers to being raptured before the great tribulation (21:36). Those who are taken are the overcoming believers who are alive before the great tribulation. One is taken and the other is left because there is a difference in the maturity in life. The one taken is the mature one; the one who is left is the immature one. This also indicates that the rapture of the overcoming believers will occur secretly and unexpectedly, at night for certain believers who are sleeping, and in the daytime for certain sisters grinding at home and certain brothers working in the field. They will be raptured to the heavens to stand before the Son of Man, that is, to stand before the Savior on the heavenly Mount Zion. Hence, the believers should be watchful so that they may overcome to escape the coming great tribulation and to stand before the Son of Man (v. 36).</p>
<p>In Revelation 3:10 the Lord also speaks concerning the living overcomers who will be raptured before the great tribulation: &ldquo;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.&rdquo; <em>Trial</em> in this verse undoubtedly denotes the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21). The Lord promises the overcoming believers that He will keep them &ldquo;out of the hour of trial,&rdquo; not only out of the trial but out of the <em>hour</em> of trial. This indicates that the overcomers who keep the word of His endurance will be raptured before the great tribulation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being at the End of the Great Tribulation</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Majority of the Living Believers in This Age and the Majority of the Dead Believers through<br />
All the Generations Being Raptured to the Air</h2>
<p>According to Revelation 14:15, at the end of the great tribulation there will be another angel who comes out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sits on the cloud, &ldquo;Send forth Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come because the harvest of the earth is ripe.&rdquo; He who sits on the cloud will thrust His sickle upon the earth, and the earth will be reaped. The harvest of the earth is God&rsquo;s people on earth, the believers in Christ (cf. 1 Cor. 3:9). At His first coming to the earth, the Lord sowed Himself into His believers (Matt. 13:3-8, 24). All the believers who have received Him as the seed of life have become God&rsquo;s crop on the earth. The first-ripe ones will be reaped as the firstfruits to God before the great tribulation. However, the majority will remain on the earth during the great tribulation. The suffering of the great tribulation, like the parching sun, will dry up the earthly waters from the believers, enabling them to ripen and to be reaped at the end of the great tribulation (Matt. 13:30, 39; Rev. 14:15-16). They will be raptured to the air with the resurrected believers to meet the Lord (1 Thes. 4:15-17; 1 Cor. 15:52).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Including the Rapture of Those Who Are Martyred<br />
during the Great Tribulation</h2>
<p>There are two other raptures, which are of martyrs, during the great tribulation. One is the rapture of the two witnesses who will be sent by God to prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth (Rev. 11:3). They will fulfill their ministry and be killed. On the last day of the great tribulation the two witnesses will be resurrected and raptured, going up into heaven in the cloud (vv. 11-12). The other rapture is the rapture of those standing on the glassy sea referred to in Revelation 15:2. <em>Standing on the glassy sea</em> signifies that these ones have been resurrected from the dead and raptured to be above the lake of fire (which the glassy sea refers to and which is the second death&mdash;4:6; 20:14), that is, to be above God&rsquo;s eternal, fiery judgment (14:9-11). These are the late overcomers who will pass through the great tribulation and overcome Antichrist and the worship of Antichrist (15:2). They will be martyred under the persecution of Antichrist and then resurrected to reign with Christ in the millennium (20:4).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE JUDGMENT OF THE BELIEVERS<br />
AT THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>After the rapture of all the resurrected dead believers and the rapture of all the living believers, Christ will set up His judgment seat to judge these genuine believers. This judgment will determine whether a believer will receive a reward or some kind of dispensational punishment (1 Cor. 4:4-5; 3:13-15). In 2 Corinthians 5:10 Paul says, &ldquo;We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad.&rdquo; The purpose of the judgment seat of Christ is to determine who among the saved is worthy of a reward and who still needs discipline.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Receiving the Things Done through the Body according to What They Have Practiced,<br />
Whether Good or Bad</h2>
<p>The believers will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, &ldquo;that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad.&rdquo; <em>Receive</em> is a technical word used for receiving wages. While the believers are still at home in the body, they should do things through it to please the Lord that they may be rewarded by the Lord at His coming. In Revelation 22:12 the Lord says, &ldquo;Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to render to each one as his work is.&rdquo; The Lord repeats His warning (vv. 7, 20) so that the believers will seriously consider the reward or punishment to be rendered at His coming back.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Giving an Account<br />
of Themselves to God for the Lord <br />
to Settle Accounts with Them</h2>
<p>Before the judgment seat of Christ, the believers will give an account of themselves to God for the Lord to settle the accounts with them. Matthew 25:19 says, &ldquo;Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.&rdquo; <em>A long time</em> signifies the entire church age. <em>Came</em> signifies the Lord&rsquo;s descending to the air (1 Thes. 4:16) in His coming (parousia). <em>Settled accounts</em> signifies the Lord&rsquo;s judging at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10) in the air (within His parousia), where the believers&rsquo; living, conduct, and work will be judged for reward or punishment. They will give account of how they have lived before the Lord and the kind of work they have done for the Lord after they were saved.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Being Examined by the Lord<br />
That the Praise May Be to Each One from God</h2>
<p>The believers will be examined by the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ. In 1 Corinthians 4:4-5 Paul says, &ldquo;He who examines me is the Lord. So then do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each from God.&rdquo; Before the day of the Lord (5:5), what is hidden in the believers&rsquo; heart is not known. But one day the things in their heart will be made manifest so that praise may be given to each one from God. If the believers&rsquo; heart is right, good, pure, and for God, then at the judgment seat of Christ they will be rewarded with praise from God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Reward Being with the Lord<br />
to Render to Each One according to His Work</h2>
<p>In Revelation 22:12 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to render to each one as his work is.&rdquo; The Greek word translated <em>reward</em> means &ldquo;wages.&rdquo; At the Lord&rsquo;s coming, this reward will be rendered to each one of the believers at the judgment seat of Christ after their rapture. This is what the Lord referred to in Matthew 16:27: &ldquo;For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Some Receiving a Reward</h2>
<p>When the believers are judged by the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ, some will receive a reward. Many verses in the New Testament prophesy concerning this.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Building with Gold, Silver, <br />
and Precious Stones</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 3:8b says, &ldquo;Each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.&rdquo; Then in verse 14 Paul continues, &ldquo;If anyone&rsquo;s work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward.&rdquo; According to the context, the work that remains must be that of gold, silver, and precious stones. Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God. Gold may signify the divine nature of the Father with all its attributes, silver may signify the redeeming Christ with all the virtues and attributes of His person and work, and precious stones may signify the transforming work of the Spirit with all its attributes. All these precious materials are the products of our participation in and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit. Only these are good for God&rsquo;s building. Such a building work will be approved by the Lord, and the believers will be rewarded by the coming and the judging Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Serving the Saints out of One&rsquo;s Own Will<br />
for the Building</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 9:17, concerning preaching the gospel, Paul says, &ldquo;If I do this of my own will, I have a reward.&rdquo; The book of 1 Corinthians was written by the apostle not to help lost sinners to be saved but to help saved believers to grow (3:6-7), to build with precious materials (vv. 10, 12-14), to care for the Lord&rsquo;s members (8:9-13), and to run the race (9:24). Hence, a reward is mentioned repeatedly as an incentive to the believers for their progress (3:14; 9:18, 24-25).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Denying the Self, Bearing the Cross,<br />
and Following the Lord</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:24-27 the Lord prophesies that if the believers lose their soul-life, take up their cross, and follow Him, they will receive a reward from Him. He will repay &ldquo;each man according to his doings,&rdquo; that is, according to whether or not they lose their soul-life&rsquo;s enjoyment in this age. The Lord&rsquo;s reward will be entering into the manifestation of the kingdom. The manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium will be a reward to the followers who remain under the killing of the cross. All the believers who follow Christ in this way will be rewarded with the manifestation of the kingdom. If we bear the cross to follow the Lord by losing the enjoyment of our soul in this age, He will reward us with the enjoyment of the soul in the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Pursuing toward the Goal</h2>
<p>In Philippians 3:14 Paul declares, &ldquo;I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward.&rdquo; The goal is for us to gain, whereas the prize is for us to enjoy. The prize here will be the uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the victorious runners of the New Testament race.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Not Casting Away Our Boldness</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:35 says, &ldquo;Do not cast away therefore your boldness, which has great reward.&rdquo; The reward is something in addition to eternal salvation. It will be given to the believers at the Lord&rsquo;s coming, according to their works (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 4:5), and will be enjoyed in the coming kingdom (Matt. 25:21, 23). The will of God for the Hebrew believers was that they take the new covenant way (Heb. 10:19-23) and remain with the church (v. 25), not shrinking back to Judaism (vv. 38-39) but suffering persecution from Judaism (vv. 32-34). If they did not cast away their boldness, they would receive the promise of a great reward (v. 35) at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (v. 37). The great reward is the coming Sabbath rest (4:9), the enjoyment of Christ and the reign with Christ in the coming kingdom.</p><h2 class="head3">6. Being Faithful and Prudent&mdash;<br />
Set by the Master over His Household<br />
to Give Them Food at the Proper Time</h2>
<p>Matthew 24:45-47 says, &ldquo;Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time? Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing. Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions.&rdquo; Faithfulness is shown toward the Lord, whereas prudence is exercised toward the believers. <em>Household</em> refers to the believers (Eph. 2:19), that is, the church (1 Tim. 3:15). <em>Give them food</em> refers to ministering the word of God and Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church. Here to be blessed is to be rewarded with the authority to rule in the manifestation of the kingdom. In the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens the Lord will set the faithful slave over all His possessions. This will be a reward to him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Making Use of Gifts Faithfully</h2>
<p>In the parable of the faithful slave in Matthew 25:14-30, the master said to the slave who was given five talents and who also gained five talents: &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (v. 21). This parable shows that if the believers are faithful to the work entrusted to them by the Lord in this age, in the future they will be given the authority to rule in the coming kingdom. They will even be given more responsibilities in the coming kingdom and will participate in the Lord&rsquo;s joy, the highest enjoyment of the Lord in the kingdom. Furthermore, verses 22 and 23 reveal that the same reward will be given to the two-talented one as to the five-talented one. This indicates that although the gift given to the two-talented one is smaller than that given to the five-talented one, the Lord&rsquo;s appraisal and reward to both are the same. This reveals that the Lord&rsquo;s appraisal and reward are not related to the size and quantity of our work but to our faithfulness in using His gift to the fullest extent.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Some Suffering Loss</h2>
<p>At the judgment seat of Christ some believers will suffer loss because of being disapproved by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Building with Wood, Grass, and Stubble</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 3:12-15 says, &ldquo;If anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one&rsquo;s work, of what sort it is...If anyone&rsquo;s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.&rdquo; Wood, in contrast to gold, signifies the nature of the natural man; grass, in contrast to silver, signifies the fallen man, the man of the flesh (1 Pet. 1:24), who has not been redeemed or regenerated by Christ; and stubble, in contrast to precious stones, signifies the work and living that issue from an earthen source and have not been transformed by the Holy Spirit. Wood, grass, and stubble signify the knowledge, realization, and attainments that come from the believers&rsquo; natural background&mdash;such as Judaism or other religions, philosophy, or culture&mdash;and the natural way of living&mdash;which is mainly in the soul and is the natural life. All these worthless materials are the product of the believers&rsquo; natural man together with what they have collected from their background. Hence, they will be burned by the Lord&rsquo;s judging fire at His coming. These believers will not only lose their reward because of being disapproved, but their being saved will also be as through fire. This prophecy should be a solemn warning to us today concerning our Christian work.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Thinking That the Lord Will Delay His Coming, Beginning to Beat the Fellow Slaves,<br />
and Eating and Drinking with the Drunken</h2>
<p>Matthew 24:48-51 says, &ldquo;If that evil slave says in his heart, My master delays, and begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the drunken, the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know, and will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.&rdquo; The evil slave does not expect his master; hence, he does not like to live the kind of life that is for his master&rsquo;s coming. Moreover, the evil slave beats his fellow slaves, that is, mistreats the fellow believers, and eats and drinks with the drunken, that is, keeps company with worldly people, who are drunk with worldly things. Therefore, when the master comes back, he will cut asunder the evil slave and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. This indicates that the defeated believers will be unable to participate in Christ and the glory of His kingdom in the manifestation of the kingdom but will be weeping and gnashing their teeth in outer darkness.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Not Making Use of Gifts Faithfully</h2>
<p>In Matthew 25:24-30 the one-talented slave, who was not faithful in using his gift, is rebuked by the Lord and punished. Verse 30 says, &ldquo;Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.&rdquo; Whoever is cast into outer darkness will be cut off from the Lord, from His presence, from His fellowship, from the glorious sphere in which the Lord will be. This is not to perish eternally but to be chastened dispensationally during the coming age of the kingdom.</p>
<p>In the New Testament there are numerous verses containing clear and strong prophecies concerning the judgment of the believers at the judgment seat of Christ. These prophecies are very serious. In studying these prophecies we should be concerned about our future, in particular how we shall meet the Lord and give an account to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>All those who are apart from Christ have no hope and are without God in the world. However, the believers&rsquo; life is full of hope, not only for the Lord&rsquo;s coming but also to be resurrected and to be raptured. The Bible reveals two kinds of physical resurrections: the resurrection of life for the believers, and the resurrection of judgment for the unbelievers. All dead believers in Christ are awaiting resurrection in Paradise, which is in Hades. When the Lord returns, all the dead overcoming believers through all the generations will receive the out-resurrection as a reward, but the majority of the dead believers through all the generations will be resurrected at the end of the great tribulation.</p>
<p>The subject of the believers&rsquo; rapture is a great matter in the Bible. The thought concerning rapture is strongly emphasized in the Bible. To be raptured is to be taken. At the time of the Lord&rsquo;s coming, all saints, whether living or dead, will be raptured. According to the New Testament three groups of believers will be raptured before the three and a half years of the great tribulation: the dead and resurrected overcomers, the man-child; the living and mature believers, the firstfruits; and the other living overcomers. The rest of the living believers, the majority of the harvest, will pass through the great tribulation and will be raptured with the other resurrected believers close to the end of the great tribulation.</p>
<p>After the rapture of all the resurrected dead believers and the rapture of all the living believers, Christ will set up His judgment seat to judge all genuine believers. This judgment will determine whether the believer will receive a reward or some kind of dispensational punishment. They will receive the things done through the body according to what they have practiced, whether good or bad. They will also give an account of themselves to God for the Lord to settle accounts with them, and they will be examined by the Lord that praise may be to each one from God. Some will receive a reward, and some will suffer loss. The believers will receive a reward from the Lord if they build with gold, silver, and precious stones; serve the saints out of their own will for the building; deny their self, bear the cross, and follow the Lord; pursue toward the goal; do not cast away their boldness; are faithful and prudent, set by the Master over His household to give them food at the proper time; and make use of their gifts faithfully. The believers will be chastened dispensationally during the age of the kingdom if they build with wood, grass, and stubble; think that the Lord will delay His coming and begin to beat the fellow slaves, eating and drinking with the drunken; and do not make use of the gifts faithfully.</p>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The salvation that the believers receive in Christ is a free gift; it is eternal and unchangeable in nature (Heb. 5:9; John 10:28-29). Hence, the salvation of the believers has nothing to do with their works (Eph. 2:8-9). Nevertheless, the New Testament reveals that among saved believers there is still a difference between being defeated and overcoming. In this lesson and in the following lesson we will see the New Testament prophecies concerning the punishment to be received by the defeated believers and the reward to be received by the overcoming believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE OVERCOMERS</h2>
<p>According to the revelation in the Bible, the principle of God&rsquo;s work among His people is to first gain a few people so that His intention may be worked into many people. This is the principle of the overcomers. History has proven that whether in the age of the patriarchs, the age of law, or the age of grace, only a few among God&rsquo;s people were strong. These strong ones are considered a collective unit fighting the battle for God&rsquo;s interest and bringing God&rsquo;s kingdom to earth.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s original intention in His New Testament economy is to have the church as His corporate expression. The commission of the church on the earth is to uphold and testify the victorious Christ. However, the enemy persecuted and damaged the church so that the church became defeated and degraded. After the church was defeated, God called a small number of faithful ones to be His overcomers to bear the responsibility of the church, which the church failed to bear, and to restore the church to God&rsquo;s original intention. What the Lord wants the overcomers to do is what the whole church should have done in God&rsquo;s economy. God called the overcomers so that they may stand in place of the church for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; DEFEAT AND OVERCOMING</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; defeat and overcoming before the Lord will not be manifested until they are before the judgment seat of Christ. Second Corinthians 5:10 prophesies, &ldquo;We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad.&rdquo; This judgment is not concerning the believers&rsquo; eternal salvation but concerning their dispensational reward (1 Cor. 4:4-5; 3:13-15). The believers whose Christian living and works are approved by the Lord are the overcomers. The reward they will receive from Him in the kingdom age is an incentive to them. The believers whose Christian living and works are not approved by the Lord are the defeated ones. Even though they will not lose their eternal salvation, they will suffer the loss of the dispensational reward and will be disciplined and perfected in the kingdom age (1 Cor. 3:8, 14-15; Matt. 25:21, 23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE LORD&rsquo;S DISCIPLINE AND PERFECTING</h2>
<p>The believers who are not perfected and not matured in the church age will be perfected in the age of the millennium. The means by which they are perfected is the Lord&rsquo;s dispensational and governmental discipline. This discipline is for the slothful ones who did not apply the sufficient grace of the Lord, did not enjoy this grace, and did not take this grace as their portion in the church age, the age of grace. Hence, they still need the Lord&rsquo;s loving discipline in the coming age so that they can be perfected.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Lord Disciplining Whom He Loves</h2>
<p>Hebrews 12:6 says, &ldquo;Whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s discipline toward the believers is not only in this age but also in the coming millennium. Since the age of the millennium is still part of the old heaven and old earth, the Father still deals with His children in the kingdom age by means of dispensational and governmental discipline to perfect them. In Revelation 3:19 the Lord says, &ldquo;As many as I love I reprove and discipline.&rdquo; The Greek word translated <em>love</em> in this verse means &ldquo;to love intimately.&rdquo; This clearly indicates that the defeated believers still belong to the Lord as His children and that the Lord&rsquo;s discipline is out of love.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being in the Millennial Age</h2>
<p>Today many Christians disregard the need for maturity. However, since the believers are selected, called, redeemed, and regenerated by God, He will not let them go. If they do not have the real experience and enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ and His unsearchable riches in the church age, they will not be transformed and perfected. Thus, the Lord will have to use the millennial age to perfect them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE PUNISHMENT SUFFERED BY<br />
THE DEFEATED BELIEVERS IN THE KINGDOM AGE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Departing from the Lord <br />
Because of His Disapproval</h2>
<p>In Matthew 7:21 the Lord said, &ldquo;Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; In this verse entering into the kingdom of the heavens refers to entering into the manifestation of the coming kingdom&mdash;the millennium. For the believers to have a part in the millennium, they need to do the will of the heavenly Father. If the believers do not do the will of the heavenly Father, they will be considered as workers of lawlessness. The Lord will declare to them: &ldquo;I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness&rdquo; (v. 23). <em>Never knew</em> means &ldquo;never approved.&rdquo; The Lord never approved those who prophesied, cast out demons, and did many works of power in His name (v. 22) but did those things not according to the will of the heavenly Father (v. 21). The Lord did not deny that they did those things, but He considered those things lawlessness because they were not done according to the will of the heavenly Father; they were not done in line with the divine will. Luke 13:27 says that the Lord called these people &ldquo;workers of unrighteousness.&rdquo; They will not enter into the kingdom of the heavens but will depart from the Lord and will not participate in the glory of the kingdom. This means that they will be excluded from the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age and will not receive the kingdom reward.</p>
<p>In the same principle, in the parable of the virgins in Matthew 25 the Lord did not approve the foolish virgins (v. 12). The foolish virgins had lighted lamps, went forth to meet the Lord, died, and were resurrected and raptured, but were late in paying the price for the filling of the Holy Spirit. Because of this the Lord would not recognize them, approve them, for participation in His wedding feast. They do not lose their eternal salvation, but they miss this dispensational reward.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Their Gift Being Taken Away</h2>
<p>In the coming kingdom age the gift that the defeated believers received from the Lord in the church age will be taken away. In the parable of the faithful slaves in Matthew 25, the Lord not only rebukes the evil and slothful slave but also takes away the talent from him and gives it to him who has the ten talents. This is because &ldquo;to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him&rdquo; (v. 29.) To everyone who gains profit in the church age, more gifts will be given in the coming kingdom age; but concerning the one who has not gained a profit by using his gift in the church age, even the gift that he has will be taken away from him in the coming kingdom age (13:12; Mark 4:25; Luke 8:18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being Cut Asunder</h2>
<p>In the age of the millennium the Lord will give dispensational and governmental discipline to the believers who are not mature; this includes cutting them off from the glory of the kingdom (Matt. 24:51; Luke 12:46). The evil slave in Matthew 24 does not expect the Lord&rsquo;s coming. He does not like to live the kind of life that prepares for the Lord&rsquo;s coming: he mistreats his fellow believers, and he keeps company with worldly people, who are drunk with worldly things. Therefore, at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back he will be cut asunder and appointed a portion with the hypocrites (vv. 48-51; Luke 12:45-46).</p>
<p>To be cut asunder refers to being cut off from the glorious Christ, from the glory of His kingdom, and from His glorious presence in His kingdom, unable to participate in Christ and the glory of His kingdom in the manifestation of the kingdom. The overcomers will be called to enter into glory to enjoy the Lord, but the defeated ones will be cast outside of this glory. To be in glory will be a reward, but to be cast outside of glory is a kind of punishment. This is the discipline that immature believers will receive in the coming age. The believers being cut asunder is to be cut off from their enjoyment of the organic union with the Lord.</p>
<p>After a person believes in the Lord, he is put into an organic union with the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). For a believer to be baptized into the name of the Triune God is to be brought into an organic union with the Triune God so that he can have a portion in God, partake of God, and enjoy God. By enjoying the Triune God in the organic union, the believer will be transformed and perfected, ready to be received into the enjoyment in the millennium at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. However, the defeated believers will be cut off from the enjoyment of the organic union in the kingdom age. This means that they will be cut off from the enjoyment of the Lord. This corresponds to the branches being cut off from the vine in John 15. Even though the defeated believers will be cut off from the Lord, from His presence, from His fellowship, and from His realm of glory, they will not perish eternally but will be chastened dispensationally during the coming age of the kingdom. The goal of this chastening and punishment is that the believers would be perfected.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Weeping and Gnashing Their Teeth<br />
in the Outer Darkness</h2>
<p>After the immature believers are cut asunder, cut off from their organic union with the Lord, they will be cast out into the outer darkness, which is the darkness outside the bright glory in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, where they will weep and gnash their teeth. Weeping indicates regret, and gnashing the teeth indicates self blame. To be cast out into the outer darkness is not to be cast into the lake of fire after the millennium to perish eternally (Rev. 20:15); it is to be dealt with dispensationally. In the coming kingdom age the overcoming believers will be with Christ in the bright glory of the kingdom (Col. 3:4), whereas the defeated believers will suffer discipline in outer darkness (Matt. 8:12). They will be disqualified from participating in the enjoyment of the kingdom during the millennium, for not having lived an overcoming life by Christ. Because these believers have no part in the wedding feast, they cannot enter into the joy of their Master, and there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth due to the loss of the higher commission (22:13; 25:21, 23, 30.) This will be a sign of their suffering the dispensational and governmental discipline of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Suffering Loss, but Being Saved <br />
yet So as through Fire</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3:15 Paul says, &ldquo;If anyone&rsquo;s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.&rdquo; <em>He will suffer loss</em> indicates loss of reward, not of salvation. The believers whose Christian works are not approved by the judging Lord are still saved yet so as through fire. <em>Through fire</em> does not refer to purgatory, which is heretically taught by Catholicism in its superstitious misinterpretation of this verse; rather, it indicates a dispensational punishment to perfect the believers in the millennium.</p>
<p>In the age of grace today the Lord is always upholding the believers and supplying them with rich grace so that they would enjoy this grace, be edified, transformed, and perfected. If the believers are faithful, they will become overcomers to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s joy in the coming age. But if they are defeated, they will be disciplined by Him in the coming age so that they may be perfected. Those who overcome in the age of grace will receive the Lord&rsquo;s reward in the coming age, be in His presence in glory, and even reign with Him. But for those who are not perfected in the age of grace, the millennium will be the time for their discipline. In order to be suitable to enter into the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth, the believers who are not mature need to be disciplined in the coming age in order to be perfected. This truth is truly a solemn warning to all Christians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The salvation that the believers receive in Christ is a free gift. It is eternal and unchangeable in nature. Nevertheless, among saved believers there is still the difference between being defeated and overcoming. Throughout the ages the principle of God&rsquo;s work among His people is to first gain a few people so that His intention may be worked into many people. This is the principle of the overcomers. As an incentive, the overcoming believers will receive a reward from the Lord in the kingdom age. Defeated believers will not lose their eternal salvation, but they will suffer the loss of the dispensational reward and will be disciplined and perfected in the kingdom age. The Lord disciplines those whom He loves. Since the age of the millennium is still part of the old heaven and old earth, the Father still deals with His children in the kingdom age by means of dispensational and governmental discipline to perfect them.</p>
<p>In the kingdom age the defeated believers will depart from the Lord because of the Lord&rsquo;s disapproval; they will not participate in the glory of the kingdom. This means that they will be excluded from the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age and will not receive the kingdom reward. If they have not gained a profit by using their gift in the church age, even the gift that they have will be taken away from them in the coming kingdom age. They will also be cut off from the glory of the kingdom and from their enjoyment of the organic union with the Lord. They will be cast into the outer darkness. Because these believers will have no part in the wedding feast, they cannot enter into the joy of their Master, and there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth due to the loss of the higher commission. They will also suffer loss as through fire.</p>
<p>If the believers are faithful in the age of grace today, they will become overcomers to enter into the joy of the Lord. However, if they are defeated, they will be disciplined by the Lord in the coming age so that they may be perfected. In order to be suitable to enter into the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth, the believers who are not mature need to be disciplined in the coming age to be perfected. This truth is truly a solemn warning to all Christians.</p>

<p>In this lesson we will see the prophecies in the Bible concerning the overcoming believers receiving their reward.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE REWARD RECEIVED<br />
BY THE OVERCOMING BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The Christian life plus the church life is an overcoming life. Overcoming begins when people believe into the Lord. The entire universe is against people believing in the Lord; hence, to believe in the Lord is a real overcoming. Through their faith in the Son of God and the overcoming life in them, believers can live a life that overcomes the world (1 John 5:4-5), the evil one (2:13-14), antichrist (4:3-4), and all the fallen situations of the degraded church (Rev. 2:4, 6, 13-15, 20, 24; 3:1, 15, 17). Even though the enemy&rsquo;s attack and corruption brought in the church&rsquo;s decline, the Lord continually sounds out the call to the church to overcome during this time of the church&rsquo;s degradation and desolation. In order to maintain and continue the church&rsquo;s work as the Lord&rsquo;s testimony so that the church can be restored to her original condition, there is a great need for some to overcome the church&rsquo;s degraded situation. The Lord yearns for this. According to the prophecies in the New Testament, the overcomers will be rewarded by the Lord in the kingdom age.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Reigning with Christ in the Millennium</h2>
<p>In the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ. Revelation 20:4 says, &ldquo;They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years,&rdquo; and verse 6 says, &ldquo;They will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.&rdquo; Furthermore, in 2 Timothy 2:12 Paul says, &ldquo;If we endure, we will also reign with Him.&rdquo; These verses indicate that in the coming age the overcoming believers, who are living in the reality of the kingdom today, will reign with Christ as co-kings and be priests of God and of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Receiving a Crown</h2>
<p>A crown is a symbol of glory. In the New Testament a crown always denotes a prize in addition to salvation (1 Cor. 9:25). The overcomers who reign with Christ will receive many crowns, including the crown of righteousness, the unfading crown of glory, the crown of life, and the incorruptible crown.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Crown of Righteousness</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 4:8 Paul says, &ldquo;Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, with which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me in that day, and not only me but also all those who have loved His appearing.&rdquo; <em>The crown of righteousness</em> and <em>the righteous Judge</em> in this verse show that in contrast to salvation, which is of grace and by faith (Eph. 2:5, 8-9), receiving the prize is of righteousness through works (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 2 Cor. 5:10). Moreover, such a prize will be given to all those who love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. The Lord&rsquo;s appearing, His coming back, is a warning, an encouragement, and an incentive to the believers. If the believers love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing and look forward to it with earnest expectation and joy, they will receive the crown of righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Unfading Crown of Glory</h2>
<p>First Peter 5:4 says, &ldquo;When the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.&rdquo; In Peter&rsquo;s time crowns were given to victors in athletic games (1 Cor. 9:25; 2 Tim. 4:8). However, those were corruptible crowns, whose glory faded. The crown given to the overcomers as a reward will have an unfading glory. This glory will be the overcomers&rsquo; enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and of Christ (2 Pet. 1:11).</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Crown of Life</h2>
<p>In Revelation 2:10 the Lord Jesus said to the church in Smyrna, &ldquo;Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.&rdquo; The crown of life, as a prize to those who are faithful unto death in overcoming persecution, denotes the overcoming strength that is the power of the resurrection life (Phil. 3:10). It also denotes that the overcomers have attained to the out-resurrection from the dead (v. 11), that is, the outstanding resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Incorruptible Crown</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 9:25 Paul says, &ldquo;Everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible.&rdquo; The incorruptible crown, which the Lord will award to His overcoming saints who win the race, is a reward in addition to salvation. Believers in the Lord have all received His eternal salvation through faith in Him. But whether they will be rewarded by Him depends on how they run the race. Believers need to run until the last moment of the race to have the assurance that they will be rewarded by the Lord at His appearing. In view of this prize Paul charged the believers to run the race that they might obtain the reward (v. 24).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Sitting with Christ on the Throne</h2>
<p>In Revelation 3:21 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with my Father on His throne.&rdquo; To sit with the Lord on His throne will be a prize to the overcomers that they may participate in the Lord&rsquo;s authority and be co-kings with Him in ruling over the whole earth in the coming millennial kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Having Authority to Rule over the Nations</h2>
<p>In Matthew 25:21-23 the master says to the faithful slaves, &ldquo;I will set you over many things.&rdquo; In the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcomers will receive authority to rule over and shepherd the nations. As a prize, the Lord will set the overcomers over the nations. In Revelation 2:26-27 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father.&rdquo; According to Psalm 2:9 God gave Christ authority to rule over the nations. In the coming kingdom Christ will give the same authority to the overcomers. In Luke 19:17-19 the Lord promised in a prophecy that the believers who are faithful in their service in this age will receive authority to reign over the nations in the coming age; this is the authority over five cities or ten cities. Furthermore, these verses also indicate that the overcoming believers&rsquo; reigning in the coming kingdom as a reward will differ in extent. In addition, according to the prophecy in Revelation 12:5 the man-child &ldquo;is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.&rdquo; In the millennial kingdom the ruler will be a shepherd. This indicates that Christ&rsquo;s authority&mdash;the iron rod&mdash;will be given to the overcomers for them to shepherd in the millennial kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Gaining Their Soul and<br />
Enjoying the Salvation of Their Soul</h2>
<p>In the coming kingdom the overcomers will gain their soul and enjoy the salvation of their soul. In Matthew 10:39 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.&rdquo; To find the soul-life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and to escape suffering. To lose the soul-life is to cause the soul to lose its enjoyment and thereby to suffer. If the believers in Christ are loose or indifferent in following the Lord, loving their soul, and allowing it to have its enjoyment in this age, they will cause their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming age, and they will have the weeping and the gnashing of teeth as a sign of the suffering of their soul. If they allow their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, they will cause their soul to have its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age, that is, to share the Lord&rsquo;s joy in ruling over the earth. In Matthew 25 the master twice says, &ldquo;Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (vv. 21, 23). When the Lord comes back, Satan will be bound, and the earth will be recovered by Christ and will be under His reign. By repossessing the earth, and the Lord will have His enjoyment. Then He will invite His followers to participate in this enjoyment, to enter into His joy.</p>
<p>In the kingdom the overcomers will have no problems, sorrows, or sufferings in their soul, for at that time they will save their soul and will enjoy the salvation of their soul (Luke 9:24). The &ldquo;salvation ready to be revealed at the last time,&rdquo; in 1 Peter 1:5, is the end of the believers&rsquo; faith, the salvation of their soul (v. 9). The soul of the overcomers will be saved from the realm of sufferings into a realm of comfort, that is, into the full enjoyment of the Lord at His unveiling, His coming back.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Participating in the Wedding Feast<br />
in the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p>In the manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming believers in Christ will participate in the kingdom feast with the overcoming saints in the Old Testament, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This is promised by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 8:11: &ldquo;I say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; The overcomers will drink the cup of the new covenant anew with the Lord when they participate in the feast of the kingdom of the heavens, just as the Lord said when He established the table on the earth, &ldquo;I shall by no means drink of this product of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father&rdquo; (26:29). This word indicates that from the time the Lord established His table, He would be physically away from the believers and not drink the fruit of the vine with them until He drinks anew the cup of the new covenant with the overcoming believers in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, that is, the kingdom of the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Ruling over All the Possessions of the Lord</h2>
<p>In the coming kingdom the overcomers will rule over all the possessions of the Lord as a reward (24:47).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Inheriting the Kingdom of Christ and of God and Entering into the Manifestation<br />
of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:5 implies that some believers will not inherit the kingdom of Christ and of God (cf. 1 Cor. 6:10; Gal. 5:21). The kingdom of Christ is the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 16:28); it is also the kingdom of God (13:41, 43). The kingdom of Christ and of God refers to the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming millennium. The overcomers will inherit the kingdom of Christ and of God so that they can enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens (5:20; 7:21; 2 Tim. 4:18). Believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God (John 3:5), and in the church life they are living in the kingdom of God today (Rom. 14:17). However, only those who overcome will participate in the kingdom of Christ and of God in the coming age, that is, in the manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium. The defeated believers will have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God in the coming age.</p>
<p>The millennium will be the kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today. Only in the millennium will the kingdom of Christ become the kingdom of God. When Paul speaks of inheriting the kingdom of God, he does not mean merely to enter the kingdom. This is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment. The coming kingdom will be a joyful inheritance to the overcomers. This should be an incentive for the believers to live an overcoming life. The believers referred to in Ephesians 5:5, those who practice the fleshly works in Galatians 5:19-21, and those who do the unrighteous deeds in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 will not inherit the kingdom of God as a reward.</p>
<p>Moreover, if believers want to inherit the kingdom, they need to love God. James 2:5 says, &ldquo;Listen, my beloved brothers: Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?&rdquo; The kingdom here is the kingdom of God; it is also the kingdom of Christ, which will be inherited by the lovers of God as their reward. Second Peter 1:11 says, &ldquo;In this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you.&rdquo; This verse clearly indicates that the kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is eternal (Dan. 7:13-14). This kingdom will be manifested at His coming back (Luke 19:11-12). It will be a reward to His faithful believers, who pursue the growth in His life unto maturity and the development of the virtues of His nature that in the millennium they may participate in His kingship in God&rsquo;s glory (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Being Glorified with Christ</h2>
<p>The overcomers will be glorified with Christ (Rom. 8:17). Glory is God expressed. Christ, the hope of glory (Col. 1:27), was sown as the seed of glory into the believers at the time of their regeneration and is now growing. When this seed reaches the stage of blossoming, it is the time of manifesting glory. For the believers to be glorified with Christ means that the glory within the believers will be expressed; that is, the believers will be brought into the full expression of the Triune God. This is the issue of the believers&rsquo; maturity in life. If the believers suffer with Christ today, they will also be glorified with Him in the future. The degree of their suffering will determine the degree of glory. The more suffering, the brighter the glory will be. Ultimately, the strength of the believers&rsquo; glory depends on the degree of their sufferings. However, Paul clearly saw that the sufferings of the present time were not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed upon the believers (Rom. 8:18). Moreover, the momentary lightness of our affliction today works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory (2 Cor. 4:17). Compared to the coming glory, the present suffering is indeed momentary and light and means nothing.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Inheriting the Eternal Life</h2>
<p>The overcomers will inherit eternal life in the millennium (Matt. 19:29). To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded in the coming age with a fuller enjoyment of the divine life in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens (Luke 18:29-30). Some believers have received eternal life and enjoy eternal life to a certain extent; however, they have not enjoyed it to the proper level. As a result, when the Lord Jesus comes back and the kingdom is manifested, they will lose the fuller enjoyment of the eternal life in that age. However, the overcomers will participate in the coming kingdom, inheriting eternal life and having a fuller enjoyment of the divine life. Hence, they will be the first to receive the full enjoyment of eternal life. This will be their reward.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Having Their Names Remain<br />
in the Book of Life</h2>
<p>In the millennium the names of the overcomers will remain in the book of life (Rev. 3:5). The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings that God has prepared for them. The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book (Luke 10:20). These blessings are in three stages: the church, the millennial kingdom, and eternity. The blessings in the stage of the church, such as forgiveness, redemption, regeneration, eternal life, and the divine nature, are all the initial portions. All God&rsquo;s chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life. If they mature in life in the church age, this earlier maturity in life will constitute a prize to be rewarded to them. However, those who do not mature in life in the church age will not be able to enter into the millennial kingdom at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. Therefore, during the millennial kingdom their names will be erased from the book of life. After being disciplined by the Lord and growing in life unto maturity during the millennial kingdom, their names will be written in the book of life again so that they may share in the blessing of eternity. Therefore, in the coming kingdom age only the names of those believers who live an overcoming life in the church age will remain in the book of life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Not Being Hurt by the Second Death</h2>
<p>Since the overcomers will inherit eternal life in the millennial kingdom, they will not be hurt by the second death (Rev. 2:11). Because of the fall and the entering in of sin, every man must die once (Heb. 9:27). This first death, however, is not the final settlement. At the close of the millennium, that is, at the conclusion of the old heaven and old earth, all the dead unbelievers will be resurrected and will pass through the judgment of the great white throne. As a result of this judgment, they will be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death as the final settlement (Rev. 20:11-15). Since the overcomers will have overcome death through their faithfulness unto death, they will require no further dealing by God after their resurrection. They will be resurrected before the millennium to be rewarded with the crown of life and will no longer be touched by death. This means that they will not be hurt by the second death.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Eating of the Tree of Life<br />
in the Paradise of God&mdash;the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The overcomers will eat of the fruit of the tree of life in the paradise of God&mdash;the New Jerusalem (2:7). Strictly speaking, to eat of the tree of life in the Paradise of God refers to the particular enjoyment of Christ as our life supply in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom, because this is a promise of reward made by the Lord to His overcomers. The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth will be the common portion of all God&rsquo;s redeemed people, whereas the particular enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom is a dispensational reward given only to the overcoming believers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Shining Forth like the Sun</h2>
<p>The overcomers will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Matthew 13:43 says, &ldquo;The righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.&rdquo; Daniel 12:3 also speaks of the same thing: &ldquo;Those who have insight will shine like the shining of the heavenly expanse, and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars, forever and ever.&rdquo; The righteous, who shine forth like the sun, are the sons of the kingdom (Matt. 13:38, 43). According to Matthew 5:20 these sons of the kingdom will have the surpassing righteousness. They will be righteous to such an extent that their entire being will shine. This righteousness is the indwelling Christ lived out of them. Today the believers shine like a lamp (vv. 14-16), but in the coming millennial kingdom the overcomers will not only enjoy the Father as the light but will also shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</p><h2 class="head2">I. Receiving the Great Reward<br />
Which Is in the Heavens</h2>
<p>The overcomers will enjoy the great reward which is in the heavens. In Matthew 5:11-12 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.&rdquo; This reward is great and is in the heavens. Hebrews 10:35 says, &ldquo;Do not cast away therefore your boldness, which has great reward.&rdquo; The reward spoken of here is the kingdom reward to be given to the overcomers for their enjoyment in the coming kingdom, not in this age. Today in the church life the kingdom is an exercise. If the believers are faithful in the kingdom exercise today and do not cast away their boldness, they will be rewarded with the kingdom as an enjoyment in the coming age.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Becoming the New Jerusalem <br />
in the Millennium</h2>
<p>Finally, the overcomers in the church will become the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom. Revelation 3:12 reveals that the overcomers will be pillars built into the temple of God. Because they are built into God&rsquo;s building, they shall by no means go out anymore. That the name of God (God Himself), the name of the New Jerusalem (the city itself), and the Lord&rsquo;s new name (the Lord Himself) are written upon the overcomers indicates that the overcomers are possessed by God, by the New Jerusalem, and by the Lord. This also shows that what God is, the nature of the New Jerusalem, and the person of the Lord have all been wrought into the overcomers as a prize to them in the millennial kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The Christian life plus the church life is an overcoming life. Overcoming begins when people believe into the Lord. Through their faith in the Son of God and the overcoming life in them, the believers can live an overcoming life. According to the prophecies in the New Testament, the overcomers will be rewarded by the Lord in the kingdom age. They will reign with Christ in the millennium and receive the crown of righteousness, the unfading crown of glory, the crown of life, and the incorruptible crown. They will sit with Christ on the throne and have authority to rule over the nations. They will also gain their souls, enjoy the salvation of their souls, and share in the joy of their Master. They will participate in the kingdom feast with the overcoming saints in the Old Testament, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Lord will set them over all His possessions. They will also inherit the kingdom of Christ and of God, be glorified with Christ, and inherit the eternal life. They will be the first people to receive the full enjoyment of eternal life. Their names remain in the book of life, they will not be hurt of the second death, and they will eat of the tree of life in the Paradise of God. The overcomers will also shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Because they are faithful in the kingdom exercise and do not cast away their boldness, they will receive the great reward which is in the heavens. Eventually, they will become the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom. What God is, the nature of the New Jerusalem, and the person of the Lord will be fully wrought into the overcomers as a prize to them in the millennium.</p>
