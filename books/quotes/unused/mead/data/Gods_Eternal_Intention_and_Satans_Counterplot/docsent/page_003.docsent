   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE AS A LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every kind of life is not only governed by a law; every life is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apple life is a law; the peach life is also a law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no need to command the peach tree to produce peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no need to explain to it how the peaches should look.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you do, the peach tree will reply, "Who are you?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can you be so foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I don't need to be told to produce peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have a peach law within me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I don't need commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All I need is for you to allow me to live and grow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Water me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Give me the proper fertilizer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then I'll produce the peaches you want.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I cannot bring forth peaches by making up my mind to do what my master has commanded me!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do not produce by activities; I bring forth peaches according to the law within me."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I was young, I saw an interesting scene of a cat catching a mouse.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The mouse was running around very actively.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When it suddenly saw the cat, it did not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The cat of course was happy to catch the mouse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before finishing it off, he played with it for quite a while.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He jumped around it and looked at it from different angles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then he threw it into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He really enjoyed his "toy."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This scene illustrates the law which governs the cat and the law which governs the mouse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All life, whether animal, plant, or human, has a corresponding law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In fact, as we have said, every life is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>More than this, every living thing or person has a law because it or he is living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, every living thing or person is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are regulated by ourselves as a law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why do we breathe?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who commanded us to breathe?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose we command a table to start breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It could not because it does not have the ability of life to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We, on the other hand, right from the day of our birth, have been breathing without anyone's commanding us to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This, and many other things, we do by law, not by activities, because of the life we have.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As living persons, our life is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THREE LIVES WITHIN THE BELIEVER</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christians are complicated persons.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A Christian has three lives!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Adam was in the garden of Eden before the fall, he had only one life, the human created life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the fall another life entered into him, the satanic life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From then on, man began to behave in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes he acted as a man, but other times as a devil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You may leave for work in the morning as a man and come back home at the end of the day a devil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even within a minute you may change from one to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the result of having two lives within you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since every life has and even is a law, with these two lives there are two laws.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Romans 7 Paul describes these two laws.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He tells us that in his mind he wanted to do the good vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>15-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The man created by God was good, moral, ethical.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Love, humility, kindness, and all the other virtues were created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That is why man is ethical.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, when he fell, another life entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This satanic life brought with it another law, the law which is called "the evil."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is the law of sin, bringing in death; thus, in Romans 8:2 it is called the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These two laws, the law of good and the law of sin and of death, are present in fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the time of our salvation, we received a third life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now, though we are only one person, we have three lives.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have the good human life, the evil satanic life, and the spiritual divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>With them we have the corresponding laws.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How complicated we are!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even when we are young, we often have the intention to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We want to love our parents and be kind to our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the human law.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, it is not up to us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"To will is present with me, but to do the good is not" 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How things turn out is up to another law.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil I do not will, this I practice" 7:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul concludes that if he does what he does not will, it is no longer he that does it but sin that dwells in him v. 20 . This indwelling sin acts contrary to our will.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The third life, the divine life, is the strongest.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus its law is also the strongest.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Spirit here refers to God's Spirit and life to His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have a law operating in us which is the strongest in the whole universe!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin and of death Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These two laws, the law of sin and of death and the law of the Spirit of life, are operating within us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Their work is according to law, not activity.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The digestive processes work by law, not by activity, whenever we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Similarly, for a fallen person to sin is not merely by activities, but by law.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To sin is a matter of law.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>To be freed from sin is also by law, by a stronger law.</S>
