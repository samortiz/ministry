[1]  CONTENTS A Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation 1 A Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation 2 To Be Strengthened with Power Into the Inner Man Living By Our New Person for the New Man
[2]  CHAPTER ONE A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17-23; 3:16-21 THE TWO DEEPEST PRAYERS OF THE APOSTLE PAUL Concerning the Church
[3]  In this book we will cover the two deepest prayers of the Apostle Paul.
[4]  If I am a person living in the emotion, I will be so easily affected by what others say about me.
[5]  We all have been called by God, but what is the hope of God's calling?
[6]  This is the power which God has wrought into Christ to do four things: 1 to raise Him from among the dead v. 20 ; 2 to seat Him at the right hand of God v. 20 ; 3 to subject all things under His feet v. 22 ; and 4 to make this Christ the Head over all things to the church v. 22 . We all have to see the surpassing greatness of this power which God wrought into Christ.
[7]  We all need a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we may see these three matters: 1 the hope of God's calling, which is Christ; 2 the glory of God's inheritance in the saints, which is also Christ; and 3 the surpassing greatness of the power that produces the church, the power that raised up Christ, that seated Him in the heavenlies, that put all things under His feet, and that gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.
[8]  CHAPTER TWO A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17-23 THE HUMAN SPIRIT The Unique Organ to Receive and Contact God
[9]  In Ephesians 1, the main thing the Apostle Paul prayed for is for us to be given a spirit of wisdom and revelation.
[10]  This spirit is not the Holy Spirit but our human spirit.
[11]  We do have a hope as a result of our being called by God.
[12]  This hope is that we will be transformed and transfigured, thoroughly conformed to the image of Christ.
[13]  To experience this power within you, first, you need to have a strong desire to get completely out of death.
[14]  If you cannot tolerate death within you, you will realize the resurrection power.
[15]  CHAPTER THREE TO BE STRENGTHENED WITH POWER INTO THE INNER MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 3:16-21 THE INNER MAN
[16]  In this chapter we will consider the second prayer of the Apostle Paul in the book of Ephesians.
[17]  In the previous chapters, we have seen that in Paul's first prayer, the key is our spirit.
[18]  Our spirit is for us to use as an organ to see the things of the church, but the inner man is not just an organ.
[19]  We need to be strengthened into our inner man with the power that raised Christ from among the dead, that seated Christ at the right hand of God in the heavenlies, that subjected all things under His feet, and that gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.
[20]  Paul also prays that we would be strengthened with power "through His Spirit" Eph 3:16 .
[21]  The issue of this strengthening is "that Christ may make His home in your hearts" v. 17 . Not only is Christ in our spirit, but also, as a person, He must inhabit our whole inward being, our heart.
[22]  CHAPTER FOUR LIVING BY OUR NEW PERSON FOR THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: John 4:23-24; 3:6; 1 Pet 2:2; Eph 3:16; 4:13-14, 22-24; 2 Cor 4:16b; Col 3:9-11 WORSHIPPING GOD IN REALITY
[23]  In this chapter we need to learn something concerning reality.
[24]  According to John 4:23-24, we need to be those who worship God, the Father, both in spirit and in reality.
[25]  THE NEW MAN The Birth of Our New Person
[26]  Colossians 3:11 tells us that in the new man there is no natural person, but Christ is all and in all.
[27]  It is wonderful to be born again, but after our new birth, we need to grow.
[28]  To grow simply means to have more of Christ added and worked into us.
[29]  We have to realize that we are now another person, the new person in our spirit with Christ as life.
[30]  If the person in the soul goes, Christ is not there, but if the person in the spirit goes, Christ goes, because in the spirit you are one with Christ.
[31]  Our New Person the Reality of the Church Life
[32]  May the Lord open our eyes to see that the church life is in this new person and nothing else.
[33]  Regardless of how good, patient, humble, kind, and mild you are, as long as you are in the old person, you cannot experience the church life.
[34]  You may be a very easy going person, yet if you are still in the old person, you are through with the church life and the church life is through with you.
[35]  This is why Ephesians 3 says that we need to be strengthened with power into our inner man v. 16 . Our inner man is our spirit, but it is weak because it is short of power, the resurrection power, transcending power, subduing power, and overruling power.
[36]  The more we feed on Christ, the more we drink of Christ, the more we breathe in Christ, and the more we are inwardly filled with Christ, the more we are strengthened.
[37]  If we know how to deal desperately with Christ, how to feed on Christ through pray-reading the Word, how to drink of Him by calling on His name, and how to breathe Him in day by day, we will be one with Him in our spirit.
