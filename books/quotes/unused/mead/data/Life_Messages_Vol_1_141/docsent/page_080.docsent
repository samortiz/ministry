   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I'm new in the church and still very much under the influence of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I was studying to be a preacher of the gospel in an organization, it was drilled into me that I had to have a burden for souls.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I would feel guilty if I didn't say something about the Lord to every one I met on the street, or at least give him a tract.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to fulfill the Great Commission, "Go ye and teach all nations" Matt 28:19 , but can I go without being sent Rom 10:14-15 ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Drop all these complications, even though they are based upon the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Come back to the simplicity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Enjoy Him day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Live Him, grow Him, and produce Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He will lead us on.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let me give you my personal testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was saved in 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I had a heart of love for the Lord and for His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After seven and a half years the Lord raised up a church in my home town, mainly through me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I had no plan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord sent people to me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>News was spread about the meeting, and people came and were attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They realized Christ was there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In less than one year the number went from two to about one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our leading from the Lord was to be His testimony in China.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We had no intention to come to the Western world to spread His recovery throughout the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, when the time came, the Lord scattered us and I was sent to this country.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is it not ironic that a Chinese from a heathen country should be sent by the Lord to this most advanced country where Christianity has held sway for so many years?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was surely not by my design.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet the Lord's recovery has spread, not only throughout the United States, but also to Europe, South America, Africa, and Australasia.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a strong testimony that if we love the Lord, contact Him, live Him, and grow Him, He will spread Himself through us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are branches of the vine, branching out the very Christ, not by our plans or activities, but just by our living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can I know the Lord's leading in the matter of preaching the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I often have the feeling when I'm alone with someone that I should say something to him about the Lord, but on the other hand I feel ridiculous approaching total strangers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here is another case of one of the Lord's seekers having become complicated either by Christianity or by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To get out of this entanglement, drop all your consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a simple way contact the Lord and live Him day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It may be that, as you spontaneously seek His leading, you will have a burden to say a word to someone concerning the Lord; if so, do it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another time the Lord may bring someone to you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then, just speak according to your inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Don't analyze.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Don't make a decision that from now on you will speak to a certain number of people every day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Don't decide to speak to someone at work about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord may lead you to someone or may lead someone to you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You can then spontaneously say something.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Be delivered from your endeavoring and striving.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Christian life is an easy yoke, a pleasant burden.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consider the clusters of grapes on a vine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without any decision, schedule, or plan, these clusters come forth, according to the inner life of the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the inner life grows, the clusters spontaneously appear.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Be at peace and rest in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whatever comes to you as a problem, reject.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord does not send complications, but only life, peace, and rest.</S>
