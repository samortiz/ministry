<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXVIII. THE TEST OF MEN BEING LOVERS OF SELF,<br>LOVERS OF MONEY, AND LOVERS OF PLEASURE<br>RATHER THAN LOVERS OF GOD,<br>HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS BUT HAVING DENIED<br>ITS POWER, MEN CORRUPTED IN MIND, DISAPPROVED<br>CONCERNING THE FAITH&#151;2 TIMOTHY 3:2-8</H2><P>To face this test, the Apostle Paul reminded Timothy that he had closely followed the apostle's teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance, persecutions, and sufferings (vv. 9-11a). This indicates that to face such a test we need to be an example in teaching and conduct in the days of apostasy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXIX. THE TEST OF DEMAS HAVING LOVED<br>THE PRESENT AGE, FORSAKING PAUL&#151;<br>2 TIMOTHY 4:10</H2><P>Demas' forsaking of Paul also should not be considered a division, but was a separation, which is always a damage to the oneness in the Body of Christ. However, Paul was not discouraged even at the time of his martyrdom (v. 6); rather, he was still very active in taking care of his co-workers and all the necessary things (vv. 11-13). This should be a pattern to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXX. THE TEST OF ALEXANDER THE COPPERSMITH<br>HAVING DONE MANY THINGS AGAINST PAUL&#151;<br>2 TIMOTHY 4:14</H2><P>The Apostle Paul put his trust in the Lord concerning the evil attacks. He believed that the Lord would deliver him from every evil work and would save him unto His heavenly kingdom (v. 18). He also had the assurance that the Lord will award to him the crown of righteousness at the Lord's appearing for his participation in the Lord's kingdom (vv. 8, 1). This was the apostle's way to face all the adverse situations. We should learn of him.</P><P>In facing the above five tests by exposing them to Timothy, the Apostle Paul could not avoid the mentioning of the names of five persons: Phygelus, Hermogenes, Hymenaeus, Philetus, and Alexander the coppersmith (1:15; 2:17; 4:14). This indicates that sometimes in dealing with some negative things that greatly damage the interest of the Lord, we may be forced to mention the names of those who are involved in the negative things, for the building up of the positive saints.</P>
