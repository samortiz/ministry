<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TAKING THE DEFINITE STEPS<br>OF THE PRACTICING AND LEARNING<br>OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Col. 1:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:58</H1><P>We all need to learn to take the definite steps of the practicing and learning of the God-ordained way. Since October 1984 I have spoken message after message concerning the God-ordained way. However, to my realization very few have practiced this way in definite steps. I do hope that from now on, when you listen to the messages concerning the God-ordained way, you will make a definite decision to take the definite steps to practice this way.</P><P>As I have mentioned in previous messages, there are four steps in the way that God ordained according to the entire New Testament. The first step is to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:9). The priesthood in the Old Testament was not a priesthood of gospel preaching, but a priesthood of offering the sacrifices. Every day the priests did one thing: they offered the sacrifices. This was the priesthood in the Old Testament. For years I wondered what the New Testament priesthood is and what the New Testament priests do. I was told that the function of the New Testament priests is to offer praises to God. However, I was not satisfied with this kind of answer. Recently, I found out that in Romans 15:16 Paul said that he was a laboring (energizing) priest of the gospel of God. It seems that this contradicts the priesthood of the Old Testament, but actually it does not; rather, it corresponds with the priesthood in the Old Testament.</P><P>Most Christians consider the preaching of the gospel as soul-winning. Although this is not wrong, it is not the real significance of gospel preaching. In the Old Testament priesthood the priests got cattle from the herd and sheep from the flock in order to offer them to God. Likewise, the goal of our preaching of the gospel is to get some saved sinners as "cattle" that can become our offering. Paul offered the Gentile "cattle" to God. All the Gentiles gained by Paul through his preaching of the gospel became saved and regenerated sinners as members of Christ. Paul offered these members of Christ as his offerings to God (Rom. 15:16).</P><P>All the sacrifices and offerings in the Old Testament are types of Christ. Thus, in God's eyes the Old Testament priests Offered Christ to God. Today we, the New Testament priests, also offer Christ to God by offering saved sinners as members of Christ. Eventually, what we offer to God are the members of the corporate Christ. The Old Testament saints offered the individual Christ, typified by all the animal sacrifices. Abel was accepted by God because he offered Christ, in type, to God. Cain was rejected by God because he did not offer Christ to God; rather, he offered his own work, typified by the fruit of the ground (Gen. 4:1-5). Today we offer the corporate Christ; we offer the members of Christ, the parts of Christ, to God. This is the New Testament priesthood. If we do not go forth to gain people, we will have no "cattle" for our offering. As long as we are regenerated, we are New Testament priests. The main thing the New Testament priests must do is to offer to God the parts of Christ, the members of Christ, that is, the sinners who have been saved and have become members of Christ.</P><P>Throughout the past seven years I have been bothered by the fact that all the saints have welcomed my messages concerning the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, and they have also prayed concerning this matter, but who has practiced the New Testament priesthood of the gospel? Beginning from the day of Pentecost, every day new members were added to the church (Acts 2:47b). However, among us there may be a period of a month or longer when no newly saved ones are baptized. The Lord told Peter that He would make him a fisher of men (Matt. 4:19). That means that Peter had to go and "fish" for men.</P>
