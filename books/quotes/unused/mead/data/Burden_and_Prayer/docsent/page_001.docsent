   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BURDEN AND PRAYER Scripture Reading: Jer 33:2-3; 1 Thes 5:19 ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every child of God should have some God-given burden.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No child of God can say that God has never given him or her a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, burdens can only be received from God when our spirits are open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An open spirit to God is the condition for receiving burdens from God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Having received a burden, we must learn to discharge it faithfully through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we have discharged the first burden, we will receive a second, and when the second is discharged, we will receive a third.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the most important thing is to open our spirits to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should say to God, I open myself before You to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because of our unfaithfulness we often do not receive any burdens; therefore, if we want to be those who bear God s burdens, we must be very sensitive and not reject any feeling that comes from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we feel we should pray for something, we should do it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the outset, these feelings may be faint, but they will gain in strength as we go on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we quench the Spirit and do not release our burden through prayer, we will lose our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the only way to recover it is to confess our sin and thereafter faithfully respond to every God-given feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As soon as we are moved to pray, we should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we faithfully discharge the burdens we have, God will continually give us further burdens to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sole reason for not receiving further burdens is that we have not released the burden we already have, and the unreleased burden has squelched us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we unload the burden, a second burden will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A burden may be very faint at the beginning, but we must be faithful to it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are faithful to do this repeatedly before the Lord, God will continue to dispense burdens to us one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>O brothers and sisters, if we hope to be of any use to God, we must recover our lost burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Burdens are especially related to the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we must seek to do His will in everything and wait on Him in His work until He communicates His burden to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His burden is the manifestation of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The burden we receive is the very will of God, and it is also the means by which God manifests His will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, God may give you a clear and strong burden to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you go along with it and act according to God s will, the more you preach, the more the burden will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The burden may be heavy at the beginning, but the more you preach, the lighter the burden will become.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, if you fail to discharge your burden, it will weigh down heavily on your spirit, and you will feel its weight becoming heavier and heavier as time goes on.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, your feeling will become numb, and you will no longer feel the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The life within will seem to perish, and there will seem to be a barrier between you and God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This does not mean that you will eternally perish, as in the case of eternal perdition; it merely means that you will feel as if your life has ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It will seem as if you can no longer touch God and that the burden has crushed you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All spiritual work issues from such burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you try to work without a burden, your work will be ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if you work in accordance with the burden that is upon you, your whole being will be increasingly liberated as you advance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may start off by having a heavy burden, but as you go on, the burden will be released, and you will be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The value of your work depends on the burden you bear in connection with it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without a burden, there is no spiritual value to your work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But with a burden, there is spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every time you work according to a burden, you will be refreshed and edified.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As your load is discharged, you will be edified in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you work without a burden, you will sense that you are laboring in vain and may even be conscious of reproof as you labor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In relation to all spiritual work, you should wait on God for His burden and then set out to discharge it in a conscientious way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But this does not mean that we need to constantly look within to discover whether or not we have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Among God s children, there is nothing more damaging than introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let us bear this in mind the most damaging thing is to turn our gaze inward.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This may be even more serious than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sin is readily recognized as such, but introspection is not detected so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>An unsuspected disease is always more serious and damaging than an apparent one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you were asked whether it is wrong to be proud, you would immediately answer that it is obviously wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you were asked whether it is wrong to be envious, you would know quite well that it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These flaws are obvious.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But you can become introspective twenty times in a single day without any sense of wrongdoing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you quarrel, you soon become aware that you have done something wrong; you quickly identify your sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But you can be introspective and be totally unaware of its evil.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Looking within is the most hurtful thing in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many Christians are given to introspection, and they are living a life of false spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before doing any work, they stop and ask, Do I have a burden for this?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Is the feeling I have a burden or not?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Is this a burden?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is a burden?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a man continually asks these questions, he does not know what a burden is.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Suppose someone asks you to help him carry a table from one room to another.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>While you are doing it, do you wonder whether this is a burden?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Would you say that it is not a burden if it were lighter and that it is a burden if it were heavier?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No. As long as something is burdening you, it is a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Remember that a burden is what you know, not what you have to discover.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you have a burden, you know it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is wrong to look inward to see whether or not you have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A burden is known rather than found.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is of great importance to recognize this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is no profit in introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The greatest damage a Christian can suffer comes from introspection; it will cheat you.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is not necessary to look for a burden day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you feel that you should preach the gospel to someone and you stop to ask whether or not you have a burden, the opportunity will disappear while you are asking your questions.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>O brothers and sisters, it is unprofitable to look within.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Whether or not you have a burden will be apparent either you have a burden or you do not.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In both cases you will know; there is no need to discover one.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you have to turn inward to find one, you do not have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There is no need to ask anything.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you have it, you will know.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If anything weighs upon you, that is your burden.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you feel heavy within, you have a burden, and if you act in accordance with it, you will be liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then you will be free to receive further burdens from God, and you will be edified in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>All the work of God is done this way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The ministry of prayer is carried on this way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Prayer and work are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Without prayer, there is no work.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Therefore, you have to learn to pick up burdens as well as release burdens through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Lord may put a certain matter within you and give you a burden for it.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If you pray, it will be released, and you will be refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But if you do not pray, you will be crushed beneath the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If you do not pray today, tomorrow, or the next day, you will feel bothered whenever you think about it, and the burden will become heavier and heavier because you have not done what you are supposed to do.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After setting it aside once or twice, eventually, you will not feel it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you repeatedly act contrary to your feeling, at a certain point you will not feel it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You will lose touch with God and no longer be able to fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>A barrier will develop between you and God because you have betrayed the burden and not acted according to God s direction.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Every work has to be conducted with a burden, whether the work is directed toward God or toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>At the same time, once you have a burden, you should act according to the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If you do not act according to the burden, you will become deadened because you have violated God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>A burden is a necessary requirement in God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Once you have a burden you have to work accordingly.</S>
