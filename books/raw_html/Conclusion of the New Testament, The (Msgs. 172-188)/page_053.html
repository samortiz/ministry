<p>Hebrews 10:35 says, “Do not cast away therefore your boldness, which has great reward.” The reward spoken of here is the kingdom reward because it will be given to us for our enjoyment in the coming kingdom, not in this age. Today in the church life the kingdom is an exercise. If we are faithful in the kingdom exercise today, we shall be rewarded with the kingdom as an enjoyment in the coming age. Then it will be the kingdom reward.<p>The kingdom reward is in addition to eternal salvation (Heb. 5:9). Based on Christ’s eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12), eternal salvation has been given to us freely and eternally according to God’s eternal selection of us. This is eternally secure. However, after receiving this salvation, how we would behave ourselves is a problem. Hence, according to God’s wisdom, in addition to this eternal salvation, a reward is promised as an incentive to us that we may be faithful in our living by the Lord and in our working for Him.<p>Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work (Eph. 2:8-9), whereas the kingdom reward is for our work after we are saved. We may not receive the kingdom reward even though we are saved, because we are void of the work which the Lord would approve (1 Cor. 3:15). In Hebrews 10:35 the Hebrew believers in particular are charged not to miss the kingdom reward—the coming Sabbath rest (Heb. 4:9), the enjoyment of Christ and the reign with Christ in the coming age.<p>Two other portions of the Word that speak of receiving a reward are Matthew 24:45-47 and 25:21, 23. Matthew 24:45-47 says, “Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the appointed time? Blessed is that slave whom his master when he comes shall find so doing. Truly I say to you, that he will set him over all his possessions.” “Faithful” is toward the Lord, whereas “prudent” is toward the believers. “Household” refers to the believers (Eph. 2:19), who are the church (1 Tim 3:15). “To give them food” is to minister the Word of God and Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church. To be “blessed” here is to be rewarded with ruling authority in the manifestation of the kingdom. The faithful slave of the Lord will be set “over all His possessions” as a reward in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.<p>In Matthew 25:21 the Lord Jesus says, “His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord.” The “few things” signify the Lord’s work in this age, “over” signifies the ruling authority in the coming kingdom, and “many things” signify the responsibilities in the coming kingdom. The joy of the Lord signifies the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming kingdom. This is the inward satisfaction, not the outward position. To participate in the Lord’s joy is the greatest reward, better than the glory and position in the kingdom.<p>In 25:21 we see two aspects of the reward given to the faithful slave: authority and enjoyment. The faithful one will enter directly into the Lord’s presence in the manifestation of the kingdom.<p>Matthew 25:23 reveals that the same reward is given to the two-talented one as to the five-talented one. When the two-talented one came and said that he had gained another two talents, the Lord said the same thing to him that He had said to the five-talented one. This indicates that although the gift given to the two-talented one is smaller than that given to the five-talented one, the Lord’s appraisal and reward to both are the same. This reveals that the Lord’s appraisal and reward are not related to the size and quantity of our work but to our faithfulness in using His gift to the fullest extent.
