   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTENTS AND PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most crucial step in carrying out the God-ordained way is to have group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This meeting can begin by having all of the attendants open up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This enables us to know each other and brings in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This fellowship will lead us into interceding prayer for each other.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of mutual prayer will usher us into practical care for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what the Apostle Paul means in Hebrews 10:24 when he said, Let us consider one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One saint may fellowship that he has been jobless for two weeks and is looking for work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another brother may speak up and tell him that he will approach his boss to see if his company is hiring anyone at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of care can be rendered in a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever the saints gather together for a group meeting, the first thing that they should take care of is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then intercession, care, and shepherding should follow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During the meeting a number of questions may be raised.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Each question should be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must realize that we all can answer the questions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Each answer is a kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no need to assign one of the attendants to be the teacher of the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone is a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we bring the new ones together to form a small group, one may be there who was recently baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This one may bring up the matter of what it is to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Others in the meeting who may have been baptized only two weeks earlier may have learned some truth by that time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may reply that baptism is just to be put into the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even from the very beginning all of the new ones can learn to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we teach, others can learn.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although the new ones can teach, they cannot teach that much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So, one who is more mature among that group may want to give a concluding word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the beginning of the meeting we should allow time for the new ones to practice learning to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then, later on, we may speak for fifteen minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is in this way that everyone will be a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From the very beginning everyone s talent and everyone s gift will be manifested, developed, and perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result many teachers will be produced among us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Following this, we should endeavor to bring them into the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can charge them to go and visit people in the same way that we reached out to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may go out with them and bring them one by one into the same practice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, this small group becomes our practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a miniature of the church in which we are.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, the church life will be carried out practically in the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In a larger meeting of, for example, two hundred, we can only do things in a general way and give a general word of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All of the detailed items of the church life, however, should be carried out in the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fellowship, the intercession, the mutual care, the shepherding, and the teaching will all be realized in the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the entire church will be brought on through the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In a church of two hundred saints, there may be twenty groups of ten or twelve who can even do a more thorough work than the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a church desires a continual increase, they must make use of the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE NEED TO HAVE OUR OWN GROUP MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My main burden is that all of us need to have our own group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Hebrews 10:25 the Apostle Paul told the saints not to forsake the assembling of themselves together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may forget everything, but we should not forget our own group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All of the mothers know that they could never forget their own children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we would take care of a group meeting in this way, the church where we are will be a great success.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In particular, the older sisters among us should pray in a definite way to become involved in their own group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They can pray for this group as a whole and for each new member by name.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The sisters must pray particularly for each group member a few times each day.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our prayer must lay the tracks for the locomotive to run on.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>So we must not pray in a general way but in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because we labored in a general way in the past, we do not have the adequate fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today we must first concentrate our effort to bring a few new ones to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The second step is to have home meetings with them in order that they may be cherished and nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In a short while we can group them together to form a group meeting of two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As I have indicated previously, the most important thing today is to have our own group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This can be considered as our own assembly Heb 10:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>GROUP MEETINGS FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The group meeting is really a means for the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, no group meeting should remain for a long time with the same number.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every group meeting should be subdivided into two groups within one year.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the way to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, at the beginning of the year we may have baptized two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We can work on them in the home meetings and gradually bring them together to form a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this way the group meeting will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All of the new ones will learn to do the same things that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By the end of the year, this group will be ready to be divided into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, in many places those who are grouped together are not willing to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In a sense they fell in love with one another and wish to remain in the old group.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the new way one group at the end of the year will become two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then at the end of the next year, there will be four groups.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is equivalent to a one hundred percent increase yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Just by practicing the new way for one year, everybody will learn.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, everyone can be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The groups themselves will produce the leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We all have to learn this new way and not delay any further.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If within one year there is no fruit, no learning, and no new groups, we have wasted one year.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then it will be difficult to be rescued out of this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The longer the groups remain together, the less they can do and the less useful they will be.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Not only should we see new ones coming in regularly among us, but we should also see new group meetings year after year.</S>
