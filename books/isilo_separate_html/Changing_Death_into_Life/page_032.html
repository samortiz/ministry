<p>All the sins committed by people in the world are spiritual fornication. The standing of people in the world before God is that of a woman. The greatest sin that a woman can commit is fornication. Fornication is unchastity. Therefore, man&rsquo;s greatest sin before God is his infidelity to God, that is, his having other loves besides God. Without exception all the sins that man commits before God are in this principle. From God&rsquo;s perspective all of man&rsquo;s sins are spiritual fornication. No matter what sins we have committed, they were loves and pursuits apart from God. If we loved only God, we could not sin. We are women, and God is our husband. Could we sin if we were chaste toward God? We all sin because we pursue other things, not God. From God&rsquo;s perspective, all the sins that we commit are spiritual fornication. The adulterous woman in John 8 is our representative, because before God we are each an adulterous woman who has committed fornication.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SIN BEING OF THE DEVIL</h2>
<p>John 8 shows that sin is of the devil. People sin because they have a sinning life. This sinning life comes from the devil. The Jews said that Abraham was their father (v. 39). However, the Lord Jesus said that Abraham was not their father, because they did not have Abraham&rsquo;s God-loving life. Rather, their life was a hating, murderous, and lying life. Such a life is of the devil. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said that they were of their father the devil (v. 44). They were children of the devil. The Lord Jesus said that the devil was a murderer from the beginning and a liar, and he is the father of lies. Hence, everyone who sins has the life of the devil, is of the devil, and is a child of the devil. As a result, everyone lives the devil&rsquo;s sinning life.</p>
<p>We might not accept or admit that we are children of the devil with the life of the devil. The Lord Jesus said that the devil is a murderer and that the devil is a liar and the father of liars (v. 44). Whether we have the life of the devil can be seen in whether we murder or lie. We may say that we have never killed anyone. Murder, however, comes from hatred. Murder is an outward behavior, but hatred is an inward thought. Hatred is the seed of murder, and murder is the fruit of hatred. Without thoughts of hatred, there would not be the behavior of murder. We may not have murdered anyone, because the law or other reasons have prevented us, but do we murder people in our mind? Do we hate people? Can we say that we have never hated anyone? We do not hate people when they flatter us or are good to us. But as soon as they do us some injustice, ill-treat us, or make things difficult for us, we hate them. Some people hold a grudge against their supervisors and look for opportunities to retaliate, because their job was made more difficult. Other people hate those whom they formerly loved because they are no longer affectionate. When hatred is manifested uncouthly and recklessly, it assaults, uses force, disfigures, or murders. When hatred is manifested cleverly and insidiously, it secretly plots, incriminates, supplants, or ostracizes. Many things in the heart are not manifested. Are we free of these things? Those who know themselves admit that it is so easy to have thoughts of hatred toward people. If a rickshaw hits us on the road, we have so much hatred that we want to beat up the driver. If a produce vendor cheats us with old produce, we are so angry that we want to curse him. It is also easy for us to loathe or hate our parents and siblings. These examples prove that our human life is of the devil. God is love; only the devil is hate. The feeling of hatred and the desire to murder prove that our human life is of the devil.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are liars. We are of the devil because we lie, for the devil is the father of liars. Therefore, whether we are children of the devil is seen in whether we lie. We must admit that we are liars. We all have the ability to lie. We can use any part of our body to lie. Some people wink to tell a lie. Others can lie by shaking their head or waving their hand. We lie, and we also ask others to lie. For example, someone may ask us a question, and our spouse may want to answer yes, but with a discreet wave of our hand, she quickly says no. In this situation we have told a lie, and we have asked our spouse to lie for us. It is very convenient to lie. Such lying proves that our human life of sinning comes from the devil.</p>
<p>John 8 not only says that all people sin but also that all sinners are begotten of the devil and have the devil&rsquo;s sinning life within them.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
