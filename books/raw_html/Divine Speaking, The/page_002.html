<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE SPEAKING<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S OLD CREATION<br />
AND IN HIS NEW CREATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 1:1-2a; 11:3a; Gen. 1:3; Psa. 33:9; Num. 11:28-29; John 1:1, 14; 17:7; Mark 1:3; John 14:10b; 5:24; Acts 1:8; 2:3; 14:17-18; 5:42; 8:4; 6:7; 12:24; 19:20; Rom. 10:14; 1 Cor. 14:1, 31</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CULTIVATING, PROMOTING, AND BUILDING UP<br />
THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Since last fall the Lord has been leading us to pay our full attention to His up-to-date move, to promote and build up the small meetings in the homes. Since that time I myself have really sold my entire being to this matter. I investigated and I researched to find out what is the most prevailing way to practice the home meetings. Eventually, up to these last few days, I have come to a conclusion: the best way to cultivate and to promote and to build up the home meetings is by speaking.</p>
<p>When the New Testament speaks concerning Christian meetings, it always stresses one point&mdash;speaking. Paul says, &ldquo;What is it then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:26). What is that? You may say that this is for singing, but Ephesians 5 tells us that psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are firstly not for singing but for speaking. &ldquo;Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs&rdquo; (Eph. 5:19). The speaking here is with psalms, with poetry. Whether you have a psalm or whether you have a teaching or whether you have a revelation, all are for speaking. If you have a tongue, that is for speaking. If you have an interpretation of tongues, that is also speaking. Furthermore, the manifestation of the Holy Spirit that is given to all the saints is firstly the word of wisdom and secondly the word of knowledge (1 Cor. 12:8). In the New Testament the Christian meetings are full of speaking.</p>
<p>Acts 5:42 shows that in the first period of the church life, those new saints who had just gotten saved on the day of Pentecost met from house to house. In each home of the early believers they met. They met to do what? To be silent? No! In this verse you see two words: preaching and teaching. They met from home to home preaching and teaching. What is preaching? Speaking. What is teaching? Speaking. They did nothing but speak. Whether in preaching or in teaching, they were speaking. Everybody spoke.</p>
<p>Then how about today&rsquo;s Christian meetings? In a big congregation with two thousand attendants, most are not speaking. There is one speaker, and this one speaker is a killer. He kills the speaking of all the rest. You may say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, in 1966 pray-reading came in. The next year calling on the name of the Lord came in, and from that time in the sharings, in the testimonies, we have had a lot of speakers.&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;Yes, but all the speakers have become professional.&rdquo; Have you noticed this? If I were to come and stay with you for one week, right away I could find out who are the professional praying people and who are the professional testifying people. A small number have become clergical, and the rest, most of them, have all been killed. Their tongues have all been cut off. I have been in Anaheim for years, and I can tell you who are the praying priests in Anaheim. Whenever we have the prayer meeting, mostly those professional praying priests do the praying. In the message meetings, I can always figure out who will testify. We have a number of professional testifiers. Every time that I finish speaking and open the meeting for testimonies, I know to whom the meeting will go. It will go to all those professionals.</p>
<p>There is also another class of professionals&mdash;the dumb people. All these brothers come in as professionals to be dumb. They all have learned not to speak. They are the top experts at not speaking. Sometimes I beg them, I charge them, I provoke them to speak, but they are just like pieces of marble. If you were to kick them or beat them, they still would not say anything. They are professionals.</p>
<p>Just a little over twenty years ago a dear one who was meeting with us said to me, &ldquo;You know today is a modern day. To do anything it has to be professional. So for people to speak in the meetings as a service to God, they must be trained professionals.&rdquo; This is exactly the practice of today&rsquo;s Christianity. They open up the seminaries, collect students, and train them to be professional speakers. Today&rsquo;s Christianity depends upon two things: firstly, organization; and secondly, seminary-trained, professional preachers. If you take these two things away from today&rsquo;s Christianity, all of Christianity will collapse.</p>
<p>Then you may say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, in the recovery we don&rsquo;t have these.&rdquo; Do not say this. You have arrangement to replace organization. You say you do not organize, but you arrange a lot. You not only have the chair-arrangers; you have arrangers in every aspect of the church life. You just arrange and arrange. Even if your place does not have that big a number, I do believe you have a lot of arrangements. If you do not arrange, the church collapses. Actually that is organizing, but you just change the term. You see a snake and you say that it is a California trout. Actually it is a snake; you just name it a trout. Do you not have the professional speakers? You do. In the meetings in the recovery we have more professional speakers. We do not have only one speaking; at the end of the speaking we have a number of professional testifiers. We do not want anyone professional. Your faces tell me that you are the professional speakers in the meetings. Or, your appearance tells me that you are the professional non-speakers. So I have discovered that it is hard to have the home meetings.</p>
<p>Recently, when we began to practice the home meetings in Taipei, I suggested not having more than ten in each home meeting. It is best, when you have over ten in the meeting, to divide into two meetings. Then I said that the home meetings should not have any leaders. There should be no human headship. We only have one Head, that is, the unseen Lord Jesus Christ. This practice sounded strange to the saints in Taipei. They began to consider, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do that. How could we have a meeting with just seven or eight? Who would speak? We don&rsquo;t have that many speakers. The church in Taipei has twenty-one halls, and it is a heavy burden already for us to get twenty-one brothers to speak every Sunday morning. If we would divide the entire church in Taipei into 399 meetings we would need 399 speakers. How could we do this? And no leaders? How could seven or eight come together with no leader? How could we practice this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the report of these two proposals went to the other churches and they tried to follow. Yet the way they followed was not according to my proposal. They followed by arranging some secret leaders. They would fellowship with some saying, &ldquo;Brother, you know that in your little group there are only young ones. So many are new ones. They don&rsquo;t know anything. You are the only one. You have to bear the responsibility. But we don&rsquo;t mean that you have to be the leader. You should not consider yourself a leader. Don&rsquo;t practice or behave yourself as a leader. Don&rsquo;t be a leader, but be the secret leader and take the lead to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All these considerations and these arrangements cause me to be very concerned. We still arrange for someone to be the speaker. Secretly we ordain one speaker. Most Christians practice their meetings in the way of having one speaker. The others would not speak in the meeting. It is hard to maintain a Christian worship service without a speaker. You need a speaker, and the better the speaker is, the more people would attend. Today all the Christian groups are striving and competing to get the best speakers. Today Christianity depends on two things: organization and speakers.</p>
<p>My proposals concerning the home meetings will rescue the churches from oldness and deadness. The way to preserve the churches is to have home meetings with a lot of speaking.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate a home meeting without the adequate speaking. We all come in and sit there in a silent way. I look at you and you look at me. This is the home meeting. Then eventually, because I am the secret leader, I have to say something. I was arranged and I was ordained. I was charged by the elders, so I say, &ldquo;Brother, did you know that the President got surgery on his nose?&rdquo; Then you will say, &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo; Then another says, &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not too bad. That is a kind of healing.&rdquo; Then there is a lot of talking about healings. Eventually we will discuss how to start the home meeting. One would say, &ldquo;We were charged not to begin the home meeting by calling a hymn.&rdquo; Then another says, &ldquo;Yes, we were even charged not to begin the home meeting by prayer.&rdquo; Then a third adds, &ldquo;Yes, I heard we should not begin the home meeting by reading a scripture verse.&rdquo; Then a new one will say, &ldquo;Then what? It seems quite strange to start a meeting without calling a hymn, without praying, or without reading verses from the Bible. How could we begin the meeting?&rdquo; Then another says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with this. This is foolish. Is this is a home meeting?&rdquo; Then what shall we do? Finally we decide to follow the Christianity way. What is the Christianity way? To call and sing a hymn first; then someone prays; then some read the Bible; and then someone gives a message.</p>
<p>Why are we so poor in the meeting? There is no speaking. What can enliven this situation? What can rescue this situation? Speaking! When you come into the meeting, you can say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Amen! Brothers, let me tell you a story. I tell you, I really enjoyed the Lord today. When I was with my wife, she tried to put me down. But, praise the Lord, I prayed for her, and she turned to the Lord, and we had a wonderful time enjoying Christ together.&rdquo; Then another can say, &ldquo;Oh, I really enjoyed the Lord today. Someone came to my office to complain, so I began speaking to him about Christ. The Triune God takes care of all the complaints. He is our life.&rdquo; Then the next one will speak, &ldquo;I was going to the campus to preach the gospel. Then I found out that I was really shy. I was afraid to talk to people. So I began praying. I prayed, &lsquo;Lord Jesus, You are my boldness.&rsquo; Then when I came to people in this way, praise the Lord, the Lord was my boldness.&rdquo; Such a meeting full of speaking would be so rich. Bring the rich speaking and don&rsquo;t kill the meeting with a sea story: &ldquo;This morning I had a difficult time because I realized that I had to catch a flight from work and come all the way to San Francisco. So I felt when I woke up this morning, maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t go to morning watch, but my wife and I considered that I should go to morning watch, so we...&rdquo; This is too much of a sea story.</p>
<p>We all need to practice speaking all day long. Then when we come to the meeting, we just speak. We should not speak as if we were in a Christianity service. We should not speak in a doctrinal way. Do not speak with a kind of introduction. Just speak. Just speak in an ordinary, common way, so spontaneously. Whenever we are accustomed to opening our mouth in the meetings, we open it in a professional way. But when we talk in our home, we do not speak in this way. We should come to the meeting to talk as we talk in our homes in our daily life. Come together and begin the meeting by speaking.</p>
<p>Humanly speaking, it is hard for several to gather together and sit for five minutes without speaking. This is nearly impossible. Even if they were dumb, they would still try to utter some sounds. It would be hard even for the dumb ones not to speak for several minutes. But it is so strange, even a &ldquo;miracle,&rdquo; that more than fifty Christians can sit in a prayer meeting without speaking. The meeting may begin at 7:30, but by 7:35 the fifty are still sitting there without speaking. This is a &ldquo;miracle.&rdquo; Too often this happens. I do not know why. Some may appreciate this situation saying, &ldquo;My, these Christians are marvelous people. They can sit there without speaking for a quarter of an hour. Surely they are the trained people. They are so silent that you can hear the falling of a pin on the floor. They are so quiet, so silent, without speaking.&rdquo; It is hard for me to tolerate such a situation or the deadness and oldness, without any speaking.</p>
<p>Let us come back to the Bible. The Bible is <em>the</em> book. We all know what a book is. A book is just full of speaking. If you do not have any speaking in a book, that could not be a book. Hebrews 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo; God spoke in old times, here and there, in this part and in that part. He spoke in many parts, on many occasions. He spoke through the prophets. Then in the New Testament He spoke in a Person. You have to realize that this Person was firstly individual. Eventually, this Person becomes corporate. The strange thing is this: God&rsquo;s speaking in the Old Testament was through the prophets. But Hebrews 1:1 does not say that today God&rsquo;s speaking is through the apostles. It says that God&rsquo;s speaking today is not through any channels, but in a Person. God today speaks in a Person, and this Person today has been increased to be a corporate person. This Person includes all the apostles, and all the members of this Person&rsquo;s Body. Today God is speaking through one Person, a corporate Person. Today He is still speaking. In this message He is speaking through me. But it is not actually through me, but through the Person of Christ. This Person is an enlarged Person, a corporate Person. Today God is speaking in this Person.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
