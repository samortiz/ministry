   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Riches of Resurrection 2:10-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 10 says, "My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord speaks very clearly here; He wants the maiden to rise up and come away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This does not mean that inward experiences are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they were wrong, the Lord would not have given them to her.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if she continued in this way, she would not be able to contact the outside; the minute she contacted the outside, she would seem to lose her peace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, she has to seek for His mountain-leaping, hill-skipping presence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Madame Guyon said, "Once His presence was a question of time and place, but now it is no longer a question of time and place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we can trust that the Lord's presence is within us wherever we are, we will not be deceived by our inward feelings."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 11 says, "For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the Lord is calling her to come away with Him, He speaks of His past experiences and the present facts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Winter" is a time of dryness, coldness, lack of growth, and testing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the first part of her experience, the Lord brought her through these things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It seems as if the Lord has clearly brought her out of all the testings, coldness, dryness, and apparent deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With His undeniable presence, the Lord has driven winter away without her even being conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The rain is not the spring rain, but the winter rain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the rain that chills and turns into snow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The winter rain keeps man inside the house and stops him from doing any work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the rain refers to trials Gen 6 7; Matt 7:25-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord tells us that many past trials are behind us as a result of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The passing of the winter rain indicates two things: 1 the present crosses, that is, the trials, are over, and 2 the Lord's cross is over, that is, the work of His cross is accomplished, and we should not dwell constantly on His death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verses 12 and 13 say, "The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; the fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord wants us now to stand on the ground of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After a time of death, spring, the time of resurrection, is here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These verses tell us that we should understand our position in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Both verses describe the condition of resurrection; they speak of spring after winter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If spring is mentioned without first mentioning winter, it means that there is only life without resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when spring is mentioned after winter, it indicates resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord shows her all the things that are in resurrection, so that she will no longer pay attention to the dead, cold, dry, and wilted winter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Flowers" signify the adornment of beauty, and "birds" signify the sound of singing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The flowers are manifested on the earth, and the birds sing in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Flowers speak of art, and birds speak of music.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to Matthew 6, both flowers and birds are under God's special care.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God cares for them so much that they can sing and show forth their beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"The voice of the turtle" may be the sound of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is also the sound of a love-call.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"The fig tree putteth forth..."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These figs are winter figs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They signify fruit that still remains after passing through death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This fruit has passed through the cross and has been tested, but it still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"The vines are in blossom; they give forth fragrance" RSV .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The vines are just blossoming; this is in the present tense.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means the situation is full of the hope of fruit-bearing and that the fruit-bearing is certain.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No one sees vine blossoms; before the flowers have time to exhibit themselves, they have turned into fruit already.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Other blossoms may not consummate in fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when the vine blossoms, it will surely bring forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the position of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everything that is dead is over, and the future is full of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord uses the riches of resurrection to persuade the maiden to come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She should not care just for the happiness in her feelings; she should experience the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is not the time to be passive; this is the time to be aggressive, to come forth, and to show forth His life to the world.</S>
