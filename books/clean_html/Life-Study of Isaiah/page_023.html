<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. A Canopy and a Tabernacle</H2><P>In Isaiah 4:5 and 6 there are another two striking expressions, revealing to us more of Christ in His divinity and humanity. These two are another pair concerning the revelation of Christ which issues from the first pair. The first of this pair is a canopy. The God-man, Christ, will also be a canopy, which is the covering glory of Christ in His divinity that covers the entire region of Mount Zion and all its convocations, that is, all the interests of Jehovah God on the earth. The glory of Christ will cover this entire region as a canopy which will be of two sections: the section in the daytime will be a cloud of smoke for a shade from the heat, and the section at night will be a cloud of brightness of a fiery flame to keep the darkness away.</P><P>The second of the second pair is a tabernacle which in the daytime will be a shade from the heat and will be a refuge and a cover (a hiding place that covers a person's body) from storm and rain. This overshadowing tabernacle is the God-man, Christ, in His humanity with His grace, as illustrated in 2 Corinthians 12:9. This is Christ as our overshadowing protection and defense. When we are in Christ as our tabernacle, we will be overshadowed from the attacks of heat, storm, and rain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Issuing in the Restoration of the Nation of Israel</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Lord Washing Away<br>the Filth of the Daughters of Zion</H2><P>The Lord will wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion and will cleanse away the bloodstains of Jerusalem from her midst by the judging Spirit and the burning Spirit (Isa. 4:4). The Spirit will come first to judge and then to burn.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. He Who Is Left Over in Zion<br>and Remains in Jerusalem<br>Being Called Holy</H2><P>He who is left over in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who has been written down in Jerusalem for life (v. 3). This indicates that there will be a book of life in which all the names are kept.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Jehovah Creating a Canopy<br>over Zion and Her Convocations<br>and Providing His Chosen People<br>with a Tabernacle</H2><P>Jehovah will create over the entire region of Mount Zion and over all her convocations a cloud of smoke by day and the brightness of a fiery flame by night (v. 5a) to be a canopy of His divine glory over all His interests on the earth, that is, the God-man, Christ, as the great canopy covering Zion and the children of Israel. This is similar to the pillar of smoke and the pillar of fire that went with the children of Israel in the wilderness. Furthermore, in the restoration of Israel, God will provide them with a tabernacle for a shade in the daytime from the heat and for a refuge and a cover from the storm and rain.</P>
