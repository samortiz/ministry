   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BASIC NEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We do praise the Lord that many have been turned to the Lord and attracted to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is really wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Several are also having many outward changes, and this too is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our basic need, however, is not just an outward turn, but a turn within that we may see what God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not what you are, but what Christ is within you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must learn by the help of the Lord to repudiate and hate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regardless of whether our self is good or bad, we must hate the self, because it is an enemy and adversary to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We not only have the outward enemy, but the inward adversary to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So we must say to the Lord, "Lord, I hate myself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever I do, whatever I am, whatever I speak is hateful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I hate what I do, I hate what I am, and I hate what I speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I hate it because it is an enemy to You."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need such a basic turn so that Christ can become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not just an outward turn, but an inward turn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not sufficient to turn from Babylon to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is wonderful, and I praise the Lord for it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is good to turn from Babylon to Jerusalem, but this is still just an outward turn.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all need a deeper, inward turn within to realize that Christ, as a Person, is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We not only have another life, but also another Person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jesus, the unique Person, the divine and human Person, is now our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To take Him as our life, we must take Him as a whole Person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why Paul says, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is no more I, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I was the old person, and now Christ is the new Person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The old person has been nullified, crossed out on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now it is the new Person, Christ, who is living in me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul did not say that it is the life of Christ that lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No, he said that it is no more I, but Christ that lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is no more the old person, but now a new Person who is wonderful and unique.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This new Person is divine as well as human, and this unique, strong Person lives in me as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Oh, may the Lord open our eyes!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must go to the Lord and say, "Lord, show me something deeper, show me something higher that I may have such a basic inward turn."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many times I have seen things in the churches which were not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet I never dared to correct or regulate, because I realized that outward correction and regulation mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The most precious thing is an inward turn.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must forget our old person, which is our self, and turn to our new Person, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we take this new Person as our life, we will see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There will be the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To take Christ as our life releases the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later on we will see that by this flow of life comes transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Pieces of clay are transformed into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But this is not by any outward doing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I thank God for our turn from Babylon to Jerusalem; yet we all need a basic inward turn from our old person to the new Person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Life is not knowledge, it is not gifts, neither is it power.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Life is a wonderful, unique, and strong Person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A PERSONAL CONTACT</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since this life is such a Person, we must contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is not a teaching to learn, and He is not some kind of faith to believe in. Life is a living Person to contact and deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If I am staying with a certain brother, I must continually contact him as a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If he is away, I still must call him frequently; otherwise, I cannot say that I know this brother very well.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I may have considerable knowledge about him, but how much I know means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To really know him as a person, I must contact him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I cannot say that, because I have known him for twenty years, I have no need to contact him now.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If so, I will miss his presence.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I constantly need a personal contact with him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since Jesus as our life is a Person, we must contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not tell others that you have known Jesus for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That means very little.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You may have known Jesus for over twenty years and yet today miss His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps I came to know Him just five minutes ago, but I am in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, I get Him, and you miss Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must forget about our knowledge and past experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We even need to forget all that we know about Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It means little.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need the present presence of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need His presence at this very moment and day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need the present Person all the time, no matter how much we have known Him and experienced Him in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need a new contact with Christ all day, moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is a living Person within us, so we must contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must tell Him, "Lord Jesus, I love You!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>O Lord Jesus, I love You!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I hate and repudiate myself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I put myself aside so that I may take You as my life, moment by moment and day by day."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus we can see that life is not knowledge, gifts, or power.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I appreciate these things in their proper place, but I can tell you from my experiences that nothing but life can build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>And this life is just Christ as the unique, living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When we take Him as our life, we are in the process of being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is all we need.</S>
