   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>John Fourteen</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The clearest writing in the New Testament regarding this, especially in John s writings, is John 14 through 17.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even after all the messages I have given in Stuttgart and New York concerning the divine dispensing as revealed in these chapters, I still feel the burden has not gone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Probably we need more messages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter fourteen the Lord begins by saying, I go to prepare a place for you...that where I am you also may be vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then He goes on to say that He is the only way to the Father v. 6 ; in fact, He continues, He is in the Father and the Father is in Him v. 10 . We can express this relationship by saying that He and the Father coexist and coinhere.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now the question is, for what purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The single purpose is that God may dispense Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To do this, He must be the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He must also be the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually He must also be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are not three gods.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God must be the Father as the source, the Son as the course the means , and the Spirit as the reaching the application, the entering in .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the Lord firstly told His disciples that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him; when He speaks, the Father does His works v. 10 . After this He said, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter...the Spirit of reality...He abides with you and shall be in you vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The background to the Lord s word here is that the disciples were concerned about His leaving them, because He had said He was going to the Father v. 12 . The Lord was telling them they did not need to be concerned about His absence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He would ask the Father to send them another Comforter who would be with them and also in them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then He continues, I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you v. 18 . His going was His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet a little while and...you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also v. 19 . What He means here is that because He resurrects, the disciples also will resurrect with Him and in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we put all these verses together, we can see the Father in the Son and the Son coming with the Father as the Spirit to be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For what purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the real center of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The dispensing comes about by the Spirit within and also through the Word without.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the dispensing is invisible, intangible, and mysterious, we cannot apprehend it without the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Along with the Spirit, we need the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we cannot apprehend, then we cannot experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For our experience we need the apprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This apprehension is through the Bible, the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD IN EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yes, the Spirit is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if we don t have the revelation from the Word so that we apprehend this, we cannot experience His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We, the leading ones, must experience the inner Spirit, the indwelling Spirit, to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are too loose, too indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every day I find I must confess to the Lord that I have not applied the Spirit enough, that I haven t walked in the Spirit sufficiently.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God as the Spirit is here within us right now, but we don t experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then when we minister, we don t have the riches; the riches are simply the experience of the bountiful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must also get into the Word to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because of our Christian background, we have understood the Bible in an altogether superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may love the Bible and study it, but we don t have the habit, the desire, the aspiration to dig into its depths.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must overcome the shallowness in studying the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Spend some time to study how the Lord expounded the Bible in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Consider His way: it is always deep.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul the apostle was the same: his way of expounding Exodus and Leviticus in Hebrews is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Experience the Spirit to the uttermost and get into the depths of the Word to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then you will surely have the riches to minister to the saints, and we shall have, using Paul s term, the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE NEED FOR SKILL IN PRESENTING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may know the truth, yet when we present it, we lack skill.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a question is raised by either an opposer or a seeking one, we should present the truth to him as it is indicated in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are short of the skill to do this properly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With so much truth in the recovery, it should have a significant influence on America.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have seven thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Think how much cargo a big corporation could dispense if it had seven thousand salesmen.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It seems, however, that we have a lot of cargo sitting in the warehouse!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We know this cargo is there, but we don t know how to make use of it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should practice, then, these two things: the inner experience of the Spirit and the outer study of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Exercise to pick up the skill to present the truth to others and to help the saints in our meetings and in our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We want to emphasize these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Both of them are for the divine dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Without the divine dispensing, there will be no church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christianity is not the church; it is only an empty shell.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We will be the same if we don t have the divine dispensing within us daily.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the Lord s recovery, this dispensing must be the central thing, so that we are being continually filled with Him.</S>
