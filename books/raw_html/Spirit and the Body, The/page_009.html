<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KEEPING THE REALITY OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>Yes, the young people need to go to the campuses for the Lord's purpose. But this must not be a movement, and it must not in any way cause division among us. We look to the Lord that He would grant us the grace we need for this. We would abandon anything that would cause a division or even give the slightest impression of division. We do not care for any work, for any movement, or even for any increase. We care only for the unique oneness of the Body. Although the number may be small, we are in the reality of this unity. But if we lose the unity, we lose the reality of the Lord's recovery.</P><P>In the churches and with the saints we must care for two elements: the Spirit and the Body. We must ask, "Is this the Spirit?" and, "Is this for the Body, or does this cause division?" We must be certain that what we are doing is in the Spirit and that it takes care of the unity. We do not want to become a movement that cares nothing for the Spirit; neither do we want to be a repetition of the division and confusion of the Christianity that does not care for the unique unity. We look to the Lord for His mercy and grace that we may always care for the Spirit and the Body. The Body is expressed in a practical way in the unique unity. We care for this unity, not merely in our locality, but in the whole earth. We must avoid anything that would cause division among the saints or among the churches. Again I say, we care only for the Lord's recovery, and the Lord's recovery is absolutely a matter in the Spirit and in the unique unity. May the Lord grant us His mercy and grace that we may be kept in His recovery. Otherwise, we shall be a repetition of the pitiful history of Christianity. May the Lord have mercy upon us that we would not become such a repetition. We all need to pray earnestly for the Lord's recovery; we need to pray earnestly that we would be kept in the Spirit and in the unique oneness. To be in the Spirit and in the unique oneness of the Body is to be kept in the Lord's recovery.</P>
