<p>The three aspects of Christ’s person as the Lamb, the Baptizer, and the Bridegroom reveal much concerning Him. However, what is revealed concerning Christ in the New Testament is far greater than this. We shall see much more concerning Christ’s person as we view Him in relation to the formation of the church as His Body. The formation of the church, the Body, is by Christ being the embodiment of the processed Triune God and becoming the life-giving Spirit to be breathed into God’s chosen people. What a great matter this is! The Christ who is the factor, the element, the essence, for the formation of the church as the Body of Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God.<p>The Bible reveals not only that God is triune but also that He has been processed. In the first chapter of Genesis there are indications that God is triune. This chapter speaks of God (v. 1) and also the Spirit of God (v. 2). Furthermore, the words “word” and “light,” the means for producing God’s creation, actually refer to Christ. Later in this chapter, in verse 26, the plural pronouns “us” and “our” are used in relation to the Godhead and refer to the divine Trinity.<p>The Triune God unveiled in the first chapter of Genesis began to be processed in the first chapter of Matthew. Verse 18 says, “Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, Mary, having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.” In this verse the Greek word translated “birth” is better rendered “origin.” Although Christ was born of Mary (v. 16), He was a “child of the Holy Spirit.” The Greek preposition translated “of” in verse 18 literally means “out of.” Before Mary and Joseph came together, she was found to be with child, and this child was out of the Holy Spirit.<p>Verse 20 says, “While he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take Mary your wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.” The expression “begotten in her” is strong; it may also be translated “born in her.” This means that what took place in Mary of the Holy Spirit was not merely a conception but a birth. From the time the Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary (Luke 1:35), someone was born into Mary. The One born in her was the very God. This is God’s incarnation, which was God’s birth in Mary. This was the beginning of the process through which the Triune God has passed.<p>At the end of nine months, a child was delivered from Mary. This child had two natures, two essences—the divine and the human. This is Jesus, the God-man, the One who is the complete God and also a perfect man.<p>The fact that the Lord Jesus is the God-man is indicated by the names given to Him in Matthew 1. First, He was called Jesus, the name given by God (Matt. 1:21). The name Jesus means Jehovah the Savior. By incarnation, Jehovah became a man, and this man is our Savior. Therefore, in the name of Jesus we see an indication of His two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. This is also indicated by the second name given to Him in Matthew 1, the name Emmanuel, “which being interpreted is, God with us” (v. 23). The name Emmanuel ends with the letters el. In Hebrew “el” means God. Hence, the name Emmanuel denotes the Lord’s divinity as well as His humanity. The Lord’s two names—Jesus and Emmanuel—indicate that He is unique, for He is not merely God nor merely man but the God-man. As the complete God and a perfect man, He is Jehovah becoming the Man-Savior. Furthermore, in our understanding, He is Emmanuel, God with us.
