<h1 class="title">SERVICE BEING FOR THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1-11; Eph. 4:12, 15b-16</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will speak concerning some basic items of service so that we may understand why we serve and how to serve. In order for us to have a clearer understanding, we will first speak concerning God&rsquo;s intention in this age.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ULTIMATE WORK<br />
BEING TO BUILD UP HIS HOUSE</h2>
<p>Most Christians know that God wants the gospel to be preached to sinners and that He wants His lovers to pursue and serve Him. Hence, Christians have always risen up to meet these needs. This is God&rsquo;s doing. Before the Lord ascended into heaven, He commanded the disciples to &ldquo;go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation&rdquo; (Mark 16:15). Besides the Lord&rsquo;s definite command, the Spirit also is always urging and moving us to preach the gospel (Acts 8:29-35; 10:19-22). Therefore, Christians have always been fervent for the gospel.</p>
<p>Likewise, God is always raising up some among His children to love Him, pursue Him, understand His will, and live in His presence. Such spiritual persons abound in the New Testament age. There were not as many lovers of God in the Old Testament age. However, for the past two thousand years a considerable number of believers have risen up to pursue the Lord. Furthermore, the Spirit is working within the believers. We often feel that we are not spiritual enough, that we do not live before the Lord, that we should love Him more, and that we should pursue Him more. Therefore, we listen to spiritual messages, read spiritual publications, and fellowship with spiritual believers so that we may receive spiritual help. This is God&rsquo;s work within us.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient for God&rsquo;s children to preach the gospel and to be spiritual; God wants more than this. He has another category of work. The first two categories of His work are for the third and final category, which is to build up His children into His house in every locality. God wants to establish His house wherever His children are. The church in every locality is an expression of God&rsquo;s house. In this age God wants us to preach the gospel in order to save sinners. He also wants us to lead the new believers to be spiritual for the building up of His house. Preaching the gospel is to gain material for the building of God&rsquo;s house, and leading believers to pursue the Lord and to be edified deals with the material by making it suitable for the building.</p>
<p>In order to build a house, a person must first gather and then prepare materials, after which the materials can be built together into a house. God raises up believers to preach the gospel so that He may obtain materials for His building. Through the Spirit and His ministers, God then perfects and edifies the new believers so that they may be fit for His building. Therefore, both leading people to be saved and leading believers to grow in life are merely procedures. God&rsquo;s ultimate goal is the building up of His house.</p>
<p>If the church can be built up in every locality as the house of God, it will meet God&rsquo;s need as well as man&rsquo;s need. Such a house reveals and expresses God, gives Him the glory He deserves, and accomplishes His will so that He can have rest. When believers rise up to pursue God, His house can meet their need and give them satisfaction. In this house people can touch God, sense warmth, and find rest. God&rsquo;s house is the only place that can give man satisfaction. Although a person may have a home, that home cannot satisfy his inner need. It is not until he enters into God&rsquo;s house that his inner being will be satisfied.</p>
<p>When God builds up the believers in every locality into His house, His children can then tell others that in order to meet God, to know God, to receive peace and rest, to obtain spiritual food and satisfaction, to be enlightened, and to know God&rsquo;s way, they must come to this house, which is the church of God. If a church in a locality is built up, people will sense that God is present. They will have rest, be fed, hear His speaking, and be in His presence. Furthermore, they will know God. God is omnipresent, but if we want to meet God, we must come to His house. This is what God desires to accomplish in this age. God wants the gospel to be preached fervently, and He also wants the believers to pursue spirituality so that His house, the church, the Body of Christ, may be built up. Preaching the gospel and pursuing spirituality are for the building of God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>As God&rsquo;s serving ones, we often see only the first two matters. We know the importance of preaching the gospel and of pursuing spirituality, but we do not know the importance of building up the house of God. This may be likened to collecting materials and preparing them without building a house. We often appreciate persons who preach the gospel and pursue spirituality, thinking that this is quite precious, but we do not see the ultimate goal. We do not see that God&rsquo;s desire is to have a house. This is His purpose. God wants saved and edified believers to be coordinated and built together as His dwelling place.</p>
<p>We are not the only persons who are unclear concerning this matter. Nearly every exposition of the Bible and most spiritual writings cover only the first two matters. Pursuing spirituality and living in the Lord are considered to be the peak of the Christian life. Seldom have believers been told that God wants to obtain an expression of His house in every locality.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Service for Building Up the House of God &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
