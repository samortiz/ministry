   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Witnesses Raised Up by God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Lord raised up many witnesses among the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of the many who were well known at the time, one was Lee Shu-ching, a medical doctor from Chekiang Province.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As soon as the Lord raised him up, he had much knowledge of life and of the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He read all the books written by Mrs. Penn-Lewis and Andrew Murray.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Having read some of his books, I can say that Lee Shu-ching knew a good deal concerning the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Anyone who heard him preach can testify that he had the Lord s presence and that there was light and power in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not long after the Lord raised him up as a young man, he was leading a Bible study for Western missionaries in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this to have happened forty years ago shows how deeply and richly the Lord s grace worked in him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regrettably, he passed away when he was in his thirties.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is said that he died because he was exhausted from his labor and contracted tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Following Lee Shu-ching there was Pastor Ting Li-mei.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thirty-two years ago I heard him preach a message titled I Come That My Sheep May Have Life and May Have It More Abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From the topic it is clear that he had some knowledge of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, when I was already saved and had begun to serve the Lord, I met him in Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although he was very old, I could sense when I fellowshipped with him that he was in the Lord s hands and had been used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was from northern China, but in that closed and conservative era, he also went to southern provinces Fukien and Kwangtung to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he was first raised up, he was very powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then there was Sister Dora Yu, who is especially related to our history.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She was involved in the preaching of the gospel throughout China.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She was from Ningpo in Chekiang Province, and although she was a traditional woman with bound feet, she received a modern education.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Her family sent her to England to study medicine, but before she left China, she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the way to England, when the ship docked at Marseilles in France, she decided to leave the ship and return to China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ship s captain and crew were perplexed, and when they asked her why she would do this, she answered, I have a heavy burden to preach the gospel to my fellow Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They assumed that she was mentally ill and paid no attention to her at first, but ultimately she bothered them so much that they were forced to allow her to return to China.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When she arrived in Shanghai, her family thought that she had gone crazy and could not understand what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, she ignored these things and began to travel all over the country preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was the Lord s doing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Her family did not care for her needs, but with the help of a Western missionary, she rented a dilapidated house on Broadway Road in Shanghai, just beyond the Bund in the district across Pai Tu Bridge.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That area was desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She lived in that house, which she called Gospel Hall, and began to preach the gospel there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Her powerful preaching of the gospel was filled with the Lord s presence; the denominations noticed this and began inviting her to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Her central message was that after being saved, a person needs to be regenerated; in other words, if a person became a church member and was baptized without being regenerated, he would not be able to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although this message was not entirely correct, at that time it was powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord raised up many others with Sister Dora Yu, from both northern and southern China; they loved and pursued the Lord constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, they had no one to lead them, their light was insufficient, their way was not clear, and they had no messages to read on pursuing the Lord as life, much less on serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, it is evident that the Holy Spirit was working because He raised up groups who loved and pursued the Lord in all places.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, there is a small community called Lin Village in the eastern part of the Shantung Province, close to Weihaiwei.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>An elderly, learned man named Mr. Sai lived in Lin Village.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He had light when he read the Bible, and he began to meet with a group of believers who were also well-educated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the one hand, they saw that the Western missionaries had brought the gospel and the Lord s name to China; however, on the other hand, they saw that the Western missionaries were incorrect in their organization.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, the believers in Lin Village refused to join their organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They accepted the gospel, the Bible, and the Lord, but they rejected anything else from the mission boards.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The believers in Lin Village were zealous for the Lord, and they went so far as to have Mr. Sai write a letter to the imperial court rebuking the Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi for being an adulteress and urging her to repent and believe the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This was considered a very rebellious act.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Ching imperial court immediately issued an edict from the Empress Dowager, ordering the governor of Shantung Province to investigate and incarcerate the rebels.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The basic governmental districts at that time were tao, fu, and hsien.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since the rebellion took place in the administrative district ruled by the magistrate of the tao, the magistrate was not only responsible for ascertaining the facts of the case but was also implicated in the crime.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, in order to escape responsibility himself, he wrote a letter to the imperial court saying that the believers in Lin Village were a group of lunatics.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way, he was eventually able to obtain a pardon for them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the meantime, on the appointed day the executioner was ready to carry out their death sentence; however, the believers from Lin Village were calm in the prison.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some of the brothers among them took off their collars and made particular preparations to be martyred for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everyone was waiting for the sound of the cannon to announce the time of execution.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With only a few minutes left before the appointed time, a telegram came from the Ching imperial court saying that they were pardoned.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This was the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nonetheless, they were not released from prison until after the overthrow of the Ching Dynasty and the establishment of the republic.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This example illustrates that the Holy Spirit works strongly in hidden places without our knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Of course, the group in Lin Village was off in some ways because they lacked the fellowship of the Body and had not read church history.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, they lacked the light seen in previous eras and took an extreme way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nevertheless, they had a good testimony; such a testimony was the work of the Holy Spirit in them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The work of the Holy Spirit was carried out even in the remote country villages of northern China, and many lovers of the Lord were raised up all over China.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sister Dora Yu was greatly used by the Lord in her youth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When she was in her fifties, in about 1920, she went to Foochow and held a gospel meeting in the Hall of Heavenly Peace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brother Nee attended that meeting and was saved after hearing the message; he was seventeen at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 1921 Sister Yu went to Hangchow to hold a gospel meeting, and Sister Peace Wang was saved in that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Between 1920 and 1925 the Lord worked in marvelous ways in northern and southern China to raise up at least twenty or thirty young people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One of these young people was Brother Wang Ming-tao in the north.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These young people had recently graduated from high school and were entering college.</S>
