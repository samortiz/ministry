   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today's Christianity is very lacking in all of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is why the Lord has still not come back.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can He return without all of these things being recovered and accomplished among His people on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is what the Lord is doing in His recovery, and this is why we say this is not the recovery of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is the recovery of life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is His work which He started in Genesis chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The enemy has done his best to frustrate it, but the enemy cannot stop the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today the Lord is going to recover life and building!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A real warfare is being waged today for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some may think that they have been called for this or for that.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But these are just the traditional things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all have been called for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May the Lord have mercy on us that we may see His divine work of recovery and what is missing in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To love the Lord Jesus does not mean to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Working for Him means nothing to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you do not believe this today, some day you will believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But that day will be too late.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not that we work for Him, but that He works on us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must not be merely His workers, but His work Eph 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must take in the Lord so that He may perfume us and transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we will progress from one figure to another and will arrive at the stage of the palanquin and the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we still need to go on to the garden and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May the Lord be merciful to us and take us all the way!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Life and building are the two main items of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why we must attain to the garden and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To the Lord we're as a garden,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Out from which the spices flow;</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the precious fruits of Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Freely in this garden grow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Spikenard, saffron, henna flower,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Cinnamon and calamus,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Frankincense and myrrh and aloes;</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>O Lord, we would ever grow Thee thus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>O Lord, come into Thy garden,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Come, Beloved, come and eat</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Freely for Thy satisfaction</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of Thy fruit, abundant, sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Yea," Thou answerest, "I am eating</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Honeycomb with honey pure."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All sweet spices from Thy garden,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Doth Thy satisfaction, Lord, secure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the produce of the garden</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is with resurrection filled</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That the Lord may have a city,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Fruits of resurrection build.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From the garden to the city,</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Growth transformed to precious stone;</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is thus expressed, reflected</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God in all His glory fully shown.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now the city, fair and comely,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As the dawn, triumphantly,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is an army strong and mighty</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Marching forth in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lo, the city and the army</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Saints transformed in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What a terror to the Devil,</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And so beautiful unto the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Tune: Hymns, #7</S>
