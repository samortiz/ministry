   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN JERUSALEM, JUDEA, AND SAMARIA</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PETER S COMPANY 9 Scripture Reading: Acts 3:1-26</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our reading of the Bible we still may be influenced unconsciously by traditional theology.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to drop the old traditional theology and come back to the Bible in a new, fresh way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we read Acts 3 in this way, we shall see that the Lord is the Servant of God, the Holy One, the Righteous One, and the Author of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We shall also pay attention to the seasons of refreshing spoken of in verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have pointed out, in our experience Christ Himself is the season of refreshing, for He is our enjoyment, rest, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>KNOWING THAT WE CAN ENJOY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Have you ever heard that you can enjoy the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Have you ever heard a speaker use the word enjoy with respect to your relationship with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many believers have never heard that they can enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In today s religion there is little enjoyment of the Lord, if any.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, by the Lord s mercy I can testify that for years I have been encouraging the Lord s people to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1965 we had a conference in Los Angeles on eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During that conference, we covered the matter of eating throughout the Bible: the tree of life, the Passover lamb with the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs, the manna, and the produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We considered the Lord s word in John 6 concerning eating Him and the charge, given by Him when He established His table, to eat His body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, we considered the Lord s promise in Revelation 2:7 that the overcomers will eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also saw the promise in Revelation 22:14, the promise that those who wash their robes may have the right to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A certain preacher attended that conference.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Afterward, he remarked that he had never heard about enjoying the Lord by eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He wondered where I had learned all these things concerning eating the Lord and enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I use this as an illustration of the need to realize that the Lord Jesus is enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some believers may not realize that Christ can be their enjoyment, because they are under the influence of traditional theological teaching in their reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever they come to the Bible, they wear the colored glasses of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to take off any such glasses and read the Bible according to its own color.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do this, we shall pay attention to the Author of life and the seasons of refreshing in Acts 3.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>ENJOYING SEASONS OF REFRESHING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BY CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we enjoy Christ, we shall have a season of refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can enjoy a season of refreshing simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Call O Lord Jesus! and you will be in a season of refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to enjoy seasons of refreshing in our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, a sister may become angry with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, she is bound like the bent-doubled and Satan-bound woman in Luke 13:10-17.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Often a wife may be bent-double because she is bound by the anger she feels for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can a sister be released from such bondage?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She can be released simply by calling, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever we are bound, we need to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we shall be able to say, Amen, Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am now in a season of refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I encourage you to enjoy a season of refreshing by calling on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some who have a great deal of theological knowledge may be unwilling to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They may be afraid of losing face.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we may need to lose our face in order to gain the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What an enjoyment it is to call on His name!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes I am beside myself with joy in the Lord when I call on Him and enjoy seasons of refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Day by day, and throughout the day, we can enjoy seasons of refreshing simply by calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some criticize the practice of calling on the name of the Lord Jesus and claim that it is something we have invented.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Calling on the Lord is a biblical practice; it certainly is not something invented by us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Calling on the name of the Lord is not a new practice in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It began with Enosh, the third generation of mankind Gen 4:26 and was continued by many others see note on 2:21 in the Recovery Version of Acts .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When some hear that calling on the Lord began with Enosh, they may claim that Enosh did not call the way we do today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To this I would reply, How then, did Enosh call on the name of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Did he say, O Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Lord, I am in a pitiful situation and have many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Lord, what can I do?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We cannot understand the way to call on the name of the Lord by reading only one verse.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, we need to consider this matter throughout the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we read the Old Testament from Genesis 4 to Isaiah 12, we shall find out the way to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Isaiah, in particular, indicates that we need to call on the Lord joyfully: Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon His name, declare His doings among the people, make mention that His name is exalted Isa 12:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We draw water out of the wells of salvation by joyfully calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Suppose a certain brother has a number of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His wife is in the hospital, his older son has lost his job, and his younger son is not doing well in school.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This brother should not say, Lord, I need You to have mercy on me because I am in great need.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Lord, my wife is in the hospital, my elder son lost his job, and my younger son is failing in school.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Lord, please help me.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Instead of praying in this way, the brother should call on the Lord and say, Lord Jesus, You are the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You are sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Lord Jesus, I thank You that You know about my situation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You know, Lord, that my wife is in the hospital, that my older son lost his job, and that my younger son is failing in school.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is to call on the Lord strongly and joyfully.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Surely this is the way the saints in both the Old Testament and in the New Testament called on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Greek word for call in 2:21 is epikaleo, composed of epi, upon and kaleo, call by name, that is, to call out audibly, even loudly, as Stephen did 7:59-60 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>From this we see that to call on the name of the Lord is to call on Him audibly.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is not a teaching or practice invented by us; it is a scriptural fact.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If you study the lengthy note on calling in the Recovery Version, you will see how scriptural this practice is.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Calling on the Lord is fully grounded on the revelation in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Furthermore, from experience we know that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we enjoy a season of refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Whenever we call on Him, we are in a season of refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is a fact in the Word and in our experience, and I encourage you to try it.</S>
