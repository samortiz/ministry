This verse shows us the Son's mingling with His Body in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Christ Being the Element of His Body</H2><P>The Spirit is the essence of the Body, and Christ is the element of the Body. There is a difference between essence and element. For example, wood is a kind of substance. This substance is actually an element. A wooden stand has wood as its substance. Wood is the element of the stand. But within this element, there is an essence. This essence is the "spirit" of the wood. Christ is the element, the substance, and the sphere of the Body of Christ. Within this Christ there is the Spirit, who is the essence of the Body.</P><P>We can illustrate this matter with a watermelon. The entire melon is the substance of a watermelon. When we cut up the melon into slices, we can see the element of the melon. When these slices are pressed, we have melon juice, which is the essence of the melon. Christ is the element of the Body of Christ, and the Spirit is the essence. To have only Christ without the Spirit is like having only the melon without the juice. We need the melon with the juice. When we have the juice, we have the essence of the melon. Christ is the element of His Body, and the Spirit is the essence of His Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Through the One Faith of the Believers,<br>Which Unites Them with the Son Organically</H2><P>When we hear the gospel and exercise faith to believe in the Lord, the Spirit enters into us. At that time, an organic union takes place between us and Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). The result is that we become an organism. This is why when Christians come together, regardless of their nationality, race, and color, something within them responds to each other. Through faith in Christ, we the believers are organically united with the Son and with one another to become a living organism.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Through the One Baptism of the Lord,<br>Which Separates the Believers<br>from Adam and the Adamic World</H2><P>Formerly, we were linked to our old ancestor, Adam. But through baptism our connection with Adam was cut. Baptism also cut us away from the world. After we rise from the water of baptism, our taste for the world is gone. Formerly, we might have been a person who loved dancing, going to nightclubs, dressing up, and wearing make-up. But through the one baptism, we no longer have a taste for these things. Now we love only Christ. We love to call on His name. Whenever we go to the meetings, our spirit rejoices and leaps. Baptism is something we cannot explain, but it is a fact in our experience.</P><P>When we baptize people, we do not need to preach or to explain very much to them. Instead, we need to exercise our spirit and our faith to give others the command to believe in Christ and to be baptized. We should tell them that it is Christ who has sent us. While we are speaking in this way, the living Christ who is within us will honor our words. If we say that Confucius or Abraham Lincoln has sent us, no one will respond. This is because these men are dead and buried in tombs. But the Christ who has sent us is a living person who has come out of the tomb and is now in resurrection and even in ascension, with all authority. When we mention His name, He is with us and honors our words.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> </body></html>
