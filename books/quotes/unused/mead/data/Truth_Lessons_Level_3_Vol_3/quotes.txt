[2]  Lesson 41 The Continuous Experience of God s Redemption 1
[3]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL THREE LESSON FORTY-ONE THE CONTINUOUS EXPERIENCE
[4]  Through the confessing of sins, the believers experience God s redemption in being forgiven of their sins.
[5]  First John 1:9 says, If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[6]  The believers are not only cleansed by the blood of Jesus but also washed in the Spirit.
[7]  First Corinthians 6:11 reveals that the believers are washed in the Spirit of our God.
[8]  Hebrews 12:10 says that God the Father disciplines us for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness.
[9]  This indicates that through the discipline of the Father the believers are sanctified so that we might partake of His holiness an attribute of His holy nature.
[10]  18-19 ; and the Spirit sanctifies us according to the Father s holy nature, separating us from anything other than God, that we, by the holy nature of the Father, may be holy in all our manner of life, even as holy as God Himself vv.
[11]  Although all things, whether on the earth or in the heavens, have been reconciled to God through Christ by His blood, and even the heavenly things have been purified by the blood of Christ Col 1:20; Heb 9:23 , they will still need to be cleared up by being burned up in God s governmental dealing, that they may become new in nature and appearance in God s new universe 2 Pet 3:13 .
[12]  In 2 Corinthians 7:1 Paul says, Beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
[13]  God sanctifies us, first, by taking possession of our spirit through regeneration John 3:5-6 ; second, by spreading Himself as the life-giving Spirit from our spirit into our soul to saturate and transform our soul Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18 ; and third, by enlivening our mortal body through our soul Rom 8:11, 13 and transfiguring our body by His life power Phil 3:21 .
[14]  Then we need to be sanctified to enjoy the riches of God; we are subjectively sanctified in the Holy Spirit as the sanctifying power, by Christ as the sanctifying life, and in God s word of truth, which conveys the reality of the holiness of God the Father.
[15]  We need to live in Christ, to remain in Christ, to dwell in Christ, to speak in Christ, to act in Christ, to move in Christ, and to have our being in Christ.
[16]  The righteousness of the believers who are found in Christ is Christ Himself, who is lived out of them to be their righteousness.
[17]  Second Corinthians 5:19-20 indicates that there are two steps in the believers reconciliation to God.
[18]  The first step is to reconcile sinners to God from sin v. 19 . For this purpose, Christ died for our sins that we might be forgiven by God 1 Cor 15:3 . This is the objective aspect of Christ s death.
[19]  Therefore, we need the second step of reconciliation; we need to condemn our natural being, apply the subjective death of Christ to our situation, and crucify our natural life so that the veil which separates us from the inward presence of God might be rent in order that we may live in the presence of God.
[20]  Christ, in dying for the believers, was made sin for us v. 21a . When Christ died for our sins, He bore our sins; in addition, when Christ died for us, He was made sin for us.
[21]  The believers second step of reconciliation to God is by God entreating them through the apostles as ambassadors of Christ.
[22]  In 2 Corinthians 5:20 Paul says, On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.
[23]  We, who are brought back to God in the Holy of Holies, experience and enjoy Him in His triune dispensing to such an extent that we become the righteousness of God in Christ.
[24]  This is our subjective experience of Christ that Christ may be lived out of us to become our righteousness and that Christ may live the righteous life in us for us to be justified by God.
[25]  This is not through Christ s dying for the sins of the believers, but rather through Christ s dying for the believers themselves and through God s entreating the believers through the apostles as ambassadors of Christ that they may become the righteousness of God in their organic union with Christ.
[26]  Enjoying the Father in the Father s love, enjoying the Son in the Son s grace, and enjoying the Spirit in the Spirit s fellowship is the dispensing of God 2 Cor 13:14 .
[27]  For us to be transformed, we need to be like a mirror, beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord.
[28]  Therefore, our faces must not have the covering of any veil so that we can see clearly and reflect accurately.
[29]  This indicates that when our heart is turned to the Lord, the veil is taken away v. 16 . Furthermore, the Lord being the Spirit frees us from the bondage and covering of the law v. 17 so that there is no insulation between us and the Lord, and we can behold and reflect the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face.
[30]  Therefore, when we grow by the essence of Christ s life and through the power of His life, we are gradually transformed into Christ s image, that is, into the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ.
[31]  Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are gradually transformed into His same image from glory to glory.
[32]  This means that we are being transformed from one degree of glory to another degree of glory.
[33]  For this transformation, we need to live by the Spirit, walk by the Spirit, and walk according to the mingled spirit Gal 5:16, 25; Rom 8:4b so that Christ s divine life can correct us, transforming us into the image of Christ in glory.
[34]  Transformation is not outward correction or adjustment; rather, it is an inward metabolic change through the Lord Spirit, that is, the transforming Spirit, carrying out a metabolic function in us by adding the element of Christ s divine life into our entire being so that our being may be transformed and outwardly express the image of Christ.
[35]  When we receive Christ, the Spirit of the Lord enters into our spirit, dispensing Christ as life into our spirit to regenerate us.
[36]  The believers are transformed gradually in the spirit of the mind Eph 4:23 .
[37]  Between Paul s word regarding putting off the old man and putting on the new man vv.
[38]  The Lord is sanctifying us and transforming us so that we may be conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God, and so that we may be the same as He is in life, nature, and image as His expression, but not have any part in His Godhead.
[39]  Romans 8:29 tells us that God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son.
[40]  We are persons who have been called and justified v. 30 ; our destiny has already been determined by God.
[41]  When Christ was the only begotten Son, He was unique, but God desired to have many sons who would be the many brothers of His Son.
[42]  He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers in Christ as the many sons of God.
[43]  Gold signifies the nature of God the Father, which is unchanging like gold; silver signifies the redemption accomplished by Christ which includes termination, being brought back to God, and being replaced by what Christ is; precious stones signify the work of the Spirit, transforming us metabolically through the divine life and the cross of Christ to make us grow in life for God s building.
[44]  FOR THE DIVINE CONFORMATION 3 OUTLINE Being conformed to Christ s death: Bearing the cross: Identified with the crucified Christ.
[45]  Bearing the cross means to be identified with the crucified Christ.
[46]  Christ passed through death by being crucified; we must be one with Him.
[47]  This involves our being identified with the crucified Christ, not with the glorified Christ.
[48]  The meaning of bearing the cross is that we bear about in our body the death of Christ, allowing the death of Christ to work continuously on us for the putting to death of our self.
[49]  It is by the Spirit that we put to death the flesh Gal 5:16 .
[50]  We not only have a base objectively, but we also have the Spirit subjectively to enable us to execute the cross of Christ upon our flesh.
[51]  The more we experience the Spirit, the more we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ, God s firstborn Son.
[52]  The believers deny the self by not living in their I. The old man in Romans 6:6 refers to our created and fallen being; the I in Galatians 2:20 is what the old man calls itself.
[53]  To lose our soul in this age is to save our soul in the coming age.
[54]  When the Lord Jesus returns, He will exercise judgment upon all His believers to determine whether or not they will receive dispensational punishment.
[55]  On the basis of the old man having been crucified, we need to apply the cross of Christ to our flesh by the Spirit, crucifying our flesh with its passions and lusts, thus practically experiencing the death of Christ and being led by the Spirit, walking by the Spirit, to be transformed and conformed to the image of Christ, God s firstborn Son.
[56]  We also need to deny the self, that is, our soul-life, our human thoughts and opinions, and through the application of the cross, we need to experience the death of Christ and not live in our I but live only in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit to be conformed to the death of Christ.
[57]  When we enter into the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus through a new and living way, we come forward to the throne of grace within the veil to receive mercy and find grace from the ascended Christ who is in the heavens 4:14, 16; 6:19-20 .
[58]  It is the throne of God s administration, but to us, the believers, it is the throne of grace, signified by the propitiation cover or mercy seat over the Ark of the Testimony in the Holy of Holies sprinkled with the blood of Christ Rom 3:25; Exo 25:17, 21; Heb 9:3, 5, 12; Lev 16:15 .
[59]  Hebrews 13:13 indicates that the believers are to go outside the camp to follow Jesus: Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.
[60]  When the believers go forth outside the camp to follow Jesus, bearing His reproach, they are following in His steps 1 Pet 2:21 .
[61]  We enter the Holy of Holies to receive grace, and by this grace we go outside the camp to follow Jesus, to bear His reproach, and to follow in His steps.
[62]  First Peter 2:21 says, To this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model so that you may follow in His steps.
[63]  If we take the Lord s yoke and learn of Him, we will find rest in our souls.
[64]  When the believers are conformed to the death of Christ, they are released, freed from many negative matters, to enter into the Holy of Holies, their spirit, to see God and consider Him, thus to receive His infusion, saturation, and filling so that they may become the corporate reproduction of God s firstborn Son for His expression.
[65]  Proving that we are the Lord s and that Christ is our Lord, who died to purchase us to Himself.
[66]  By walking according to the Spirit and walking by the Spirit: According to the mingled spirit the believers spirit mingled with the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ.
[67]  In 2 Corinthians 5:15 Paul says, He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.
[68]  Worldly people always live to themselves, but the love of Christ constrains us to live to Him and not to ourselves.
[69]  If we live to Christ, we will walk according to the spirit and by the Spirit.
[70]  To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent upon the Spirit and regulated by the Spirit; to walk by the Spirit is to let the Holy Spirit regulate our walk from our spirit.
[71]  In the first walk by the Spirit, we take the Spirit as the essence of our life; in the second walk by the Spirit, we take the Spirit as the path for our way so that we may accomplish God s purpose and reach the aim of our living on earth.
[72]  Romans 8:6 says, The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.
[73]  Spirit in this verse refers to the mingled spirit, that is, our regenerated spirit mingled with the divine Spirit.
[74]  We are sowing unto the Spirit when we walk according to the Spirit, setting our mind on the spirit.
[75]  In God s New Testament economy, God, as the Spirit, has given Himself to us; now we should sow unto the Spirit, taking the Spirit as our aim.
[76]  In John 16:10 the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit will convict the world concerning righteousness: Because I am going to the Father and you no longer behold Me. Righteousness is the resurrected Christ 1 Cor 1:30 . Christ the Son in resurrection went to the Father in the heavens.
[77]  If we believe into Christ, we receive God s righteousness in Christ, and this righteousness is Christ Himself.
[78]  God s Son, having fulfilled the righteous requirements of the Father and having been accepted by Him, was given to the believers to be our righteousness; in Him we are justified before God.
[79]  The believers were born as a newborn child through Christ s going and coming, that is, through His death and resurrection.
[80]  According to the Gospel of John, the Lord s going was His all-inclusive death to put away sin, to terminate the old creation, to judge the world, to destroy Satan, to abolish the law of the commandments in ordinances, to release the divine life, and to prepare a place for the believers to enter into God.
[81]  Many readers of the Gospel of John consider that the Lord s word about His coming again after going away in John 14 is about His second coming; rather, the Lord was speaking of His resurrection, an event that would take place in a few days.
[82]  Righteousness is related to Christ, because the Son went to the Father in resurrection and ascension; this is proof that Christ has accomplished God s redemption, that this redemption has been accepted by God the Father in fulfilling His righteous requirement, and that the believers can be justified by God through this righteousness.
[83]  The Spirit is the reality of the Son abiding in us John 14:18-20 .
[84]  The Spirit is the reality of Christ to make Christ real in those who believe into Him as their life and life supply.
[85]  Hence, Christ as the embodiment of God is fully realized in the Spirit of reality.
[86]  The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father is and whatever the Son is are realized in the Spirit.
[87]  First, this prayer was fulfilled in His resurrection, because His divine element, including His divine life and His divine glory, was released from within His humanity into His many believers 12:23-24 , bringing His whole being, including His humanity, into glory Luke 24:26 , and because the Father s divine element was expressed in His resurrection and glorification.
[88]  FOR THE DIVINE CONFORMATION 8 OUTLINE By being filled in spirit by the processed Triune God and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly.
[89]  In the previous lessons we saw that in the progressing stage of God s full salvation, the believers experience and enjoyment of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation is by being transformed, by being conformed to the image of Christ, by being conformed to the death of Christ, by entering the Holy of Holies, by following Jesus, by living to Christ, by walking according to the Spirit and by the Spirit, by sowing unto the Spirit, by walking by faith, and by living in the organism of the Divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.
[90]  To be filled with the word of Christ means to let the word of Christ dwell in us, that is, to let it richly make home in us, having adequate room to operate in us, so that it may minister the riches of Christ into our inner being, making our inner man the home of Christ and of His rich word.
[91]  According to the New Testament, reality is God revealed.
[92]  Because grace and reality came through Jesus Christ John 1:17 , they must be something of God Himself.
[93]  When we are filled in our spirit by the Spirit and let the word of Christ make home in us, we spontaneously live a life that matches the new man in grace and truth and the wife of Christ in love and light.
[94]  When we are filled in our spirit by the Spirit and saturated with the word of Christ, we will also speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life.
[95]  When we are filled in spirit by the processed Triune God and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we will speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with our heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father.
[96]  By being filled in our spirit by the Spirit and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, we are also subject to one another in the fear of Christ to live a proper human life.
[97]  Colossians emphasizes that we should hold Christ as our Head and take Him as our life by having His rich word dwelling in us so that the highest ethical relationships, issuing not from our natural life but from Christ as our life, may be realized for His expression.
[98]  A wife s subjection plus a husband s love constitutes a proper married life and typifies the normal church life in which the church is subject to Christ and Christ loves the church.
[99]  When we are filled by the processed Triune God and let the word of Christ, which is the embodiment of the Triune God, dwell in us richly, we will be filled, saturated, and permeated with the Triune God.
[100]  By this kind of dispensing in the divine transformation, we are conformed to the image of God s firstborn Son, Christ, to be the corporate expression of God in Christ.
[101]  Furthermore, when the word as the embodiment of Christ dwells in us and is mingled with our inner being, spontaneously we will do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, act in the Spirit, giving thanks at all times to our God and Father.
