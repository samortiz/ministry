<P>Recently, due to the special experience which my physical body has undergone, I have come to realize, on the one hand, the reality of eternity, and on the other hand, my indebtedness to the church of God. Therefore, I began to wish that I could finish this book within the shortest possible time. I thank God the Father, and I also thank a few of my friends in the Lord, who have prepared a quiet place for me according to the need of my body. This allowed me to finish Sections One through Four within a few months. Although I have not yet started on the remaining sections, God the Father is always waiting for me when I need the grace. Now that this book is about to be published, I would say a few honest words: it was not an easy matter to learn the truths of this book, and it was more difficult to write about the truths of this book. During those two months, I can say that I was living between Satan's jaws. What a conflict that was! How much there was to withstand! All the strength of the spirit, the soul, and the body were hurled against Hades. Such warfare has temporarily ceased now. However, the remaining sections are not finished. May those who stood with Moses on the mount not forget Joshua on the plain. I know that the enemy deeply hates this book. He will try all he can to obstruct it and to stop people from getting it. Even when they get it, he will stop them from reading it. May the enemy not prevail in this matter.</P><P>Because of the thickness of the book, I have divided it into three volumes. Some parts of the book emphasize spiritual life, while others emphasize spiritual warfare. The parts that speak of spiritual warfare also speak of spiritual life, and the parts that speak of spiritual life also cover spiritual warfare. The only difference between them is the emphasis. Since the purpose of this book is to guide those who are lost, more attention is paid to the actual steps of the journey than to exhortations to take the journey. This book is not an exhortation to the pursuit of spiritual truths; rather, it is for those who are pursuing spiritual truths but who have not found the way. All those who have the desire will find the proper guidance. The style of this book is neither homiletic nor expositional. There are variations in the degree of depth covered. One should take note of this fact while he is reading it.</P><P>I deeply believe that the spiritual conditions of the readers of this book will be very uneven. The degrees of spiritual life mentioned in this book are also quite varied from one section of the book to the other. Hence, if a reader comes across places that he does not understand or finds difficult to comprehend, he should not reject them and not try to research them with his mind; those truths are for those who are more mature. If he will read the book again after a while, perhaps after half a month or a month, he will find that he will understand more of them. In short, what this book talks about is absolutely a matter of spiritual life and spiritual experience, and no one can try to understand it by any method. What one considers as most common and unattractive may in the end turn out to be most precious. The point to which a person has reached is the degree to which he will understand. Does this then mean that a person can only understand something after he has reached that point? If that is the case, why is there the need for this book at all? There is a mystery in a believer's spiritual experience: for the Lord to lead a believer into a deeper spiritual life, He will first give such a one a taste of the outline of that level of spiritual life before actually leading him into it. When many believers first get the taste of a certain level of spirituality, they think that they have already attained to that level. Little do they realize that it is only the beginning of the Lord's work in leading them into such matters. Hence, when a believer has tasted a certain level but has not entered fully into it, he can take advantage of the teachings of this book.</P><P>We should beware of one thing in reading a book of this nature: we should not take the knowledge acquired from this book as a tool for self-analysis. If we see in God's light, we will have the knowledge of ourselves, and at the same time we will not lose our broadness in the Lord. But if we analyze all day long, we will be in our own thoughts and feelings. Such unrelenting self-analysis will hinder us from losing our self in Christ. Unless a believer has been deeply taught by the Lord, he will not know anything. All self-analysis and self-consciousness are harmful to the spiritual life.</P>
