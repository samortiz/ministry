<h1 class="title">BUILDING THE CHURCH<br />
WITH THE RICHES OF CHRIST TO BE<br />
THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the building of the church from two aspects&mdash;the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ. The church is built with the riches of Christ to produce the fullness of Christ, and this fullness is the church. What is the difference between the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8) and the fullness of Christ (1:23; 4:13)? Even those who are accustomed to hearing many spiritual terms often cannot differentiate between these terms, but the Bible differentiates between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RICHES OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Riches of Christ</h2>
<p>Concerning the riches of Christ, Ephesians 3:8 says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&rdquo; <em>Unsearchable</em> in this verse also means &ldquo;inexhaustible&rdquo; and &ldquo;boundless.&rdquo; The apostle Paul said that he was particularly graced by the Lord to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable, inexhaustible, and boundless riches of Christ. He did not preach doctrine or teachings. He preached the unsearchable and boundless riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fullness of Christ</h2>
<p>The fullness of Christ is spoken of twice in Ephesians. The first time is in 1:22-23, which says, &ldquo;The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; These verses clearly say that the church is the Body of Christ and also the fullness of Christ. The Lord Christ is the One who fills all in all. Since He is so vast and rich, He needs a Body to be His fullness, and that Body is the church.</p>
<p>The fullness of Christ is spoken of a second time in 4:13, which says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; Verses 11 through 12 say that the Lord &ldquo;gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; A gift perfects the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the building up of the church, until the Body arrives at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. When we compare these verses with 1:22-23, we see that the church as the fullness of Christ should have a measure of full stature.</p>
<p>Another verse concerning the fullness of Christ is John 1:16: &ldquo;Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; <em>Fullness</em> is used three times in relation to Christ. John 1:16 says that we have all received of His fullness, Ephesians 1:22-23 says that the church as the Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ, and 4:13 says that we must arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fullness of God</h2>
<p>The Bible also speaks of the fullness of God. Ephesians 3:19 says, &ldquo;To know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; In verse 18 Paul says that the breadth and length and height and depth of Christ are unlimited, and in verse 19 he says that the love of Christ surpasses what the human mind can apprehend. We need to be filled with the unsearchably rich Christ unto the fullness of God.</p>
<p>There are two verses in Colossians that speak of the fullness of God. Verse 19 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;In Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell,&rdquo; and verse 9 of chapter 2 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; <em>Fullness</em> in these two verses refers to the fullness of God dwelling in Christ. The following verse, 2:10, says, &ldquo;You have been made full in Him.&rdquo; The Greek word translated as &ldquo;made full&rdquo; is not the same word as the word translated &ldquo;fullness&rdquo; in 1:19 and 2:9. The Greek word for &ldquo;made full&rdquo; implies completeness through fullness. Hence, we are made complete through Christ as the fullness. Because all the fullness dwells in Christ, after we have been put into Him, we are complete, made full, in Him.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the word <em>fullness</em> is used three times in relation to Christ (John 1:16; Eph. 1:23; 4:13) and three times in relation to God (Eph. 3:19; Col. 1:19; 2:9). The Greek word for &ldquo;riches&rdquo; in Ephesians 3:8 is different from the word for &ldquo;fullness.&rdquo;</p>
