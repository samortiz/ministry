In 1826 in Dublin, Ireland, a handful of brothers began to meet together with the realization that they should receive all believers. One day in 1827 a clergyman of the Church of Ireland\u2014John Nelson Darby\u2014came into their midst and expressed a desire to meet with them. Although the brothers were gathered outside of all Christian divisions, they welcomed him. Darby remained a clergyman in the Church of Ireland and met with the brothers in Dublin for the greater part of a year. During that entire time the brothers received him as a brother and never asked him to leave the Church of Ireland. By receiving Darby simply on the ground of the Christian faith, the brothers in Dublin exhibited a proper spirit of generality and openness. Eventually, Darby was made clear [80] by the Lord that he should leave the Church of Ireland and give up his clerical position. Shortly after that, in 1828, he wrote a historic pamphlet concerning the church, entitled The Nature and Unity of the Church of Christ.

This division was due mainly to a quarrel between Newton and Darby concerning the timing of the church\u2019s rapture. Darby insisted that the rapture of the entire church would take place before the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), whereas Newton taught that the church would be raptured following the tribulation. When a sharp contention arose between the two brothers, Darby and those taking the lead with him excommunicated Newton. When Newton left the fellowship, some of those who appreciated him left with him.

This was a departure from the original attitude of the Brethren, which had allowed Darby himself to be received into fellowship with them even when he was still an [83] active clergyman in the Church of Ireland. A number of brothers, including George M\u00fcller, disagreed with Darby\u2019s view and maintained that although some believers continued to meet in the denominations, they were still brothers and sisters in the Lord, and as such, they should be received into the fellowship. The disagreement that arose over this matter caused a second major division among the Brethren. Darby\u2019s group came to be known as the Closed Brethren or the Exclusive Brethren. The group that agreed with M\u00fcller is generally referred to as the Open Brethren. The two divisions\u2014between Darby and Newton and between Darby\u2019s group and the group that included M\u00fcller\u2014were the beginning of an endless history of division among the Brethren. By the time of the First World War the Brethren had divided themselves into more than one hundred divisions.

The pitiful situation today is that some who do not have a doctorate still seek to have a degree. Some of today\u2019s preachers have never attended a university, yet they advertise themselves as Dr. So-and-so. The Brethren rejected all such worldly things; they were freed from them.

Darby felt that Newton\u2019s interpretation did not have enough regard for the Lord\u2019s redemption, thus lessening its effectiveness.

In 1828 the Lord raised up a group of brothers in England. Of those among them, Brother Darby had the greatest gift. Gradually, however, many different sects developed among them based on differing interpretations of the Bible. This led to the various sects not receiving others with differing opinions. For example, one group among them advocated the practice of head covering and would not receive those who did not accept their teaching concerning head covering. Darby believed in a pre-tribulation rapture of the believers, and eventually those who believed in a post-tribulation rapture were not received. This was the source of the separation between Darby and his co-worker Benjamin Newton. Darby stressed a pre-tribulation rapture, but Newton stressed a post-tribulation rapture.

He was called the king of faith in the nineteenth century. He was so much with the Lord, but there was a big discrepancy between his understanding and Darby\u2019s realization. Darby and his followers insisted on not accepting any Christian who was still joined to a denomination. They considered all denominations as sin, evil. Thus, in their eyes, regardless of how good or spiritual a person was, as long as he remained in a denomination, he was considered by them as a companion of this evil. They considered a Christian in a denomination as an evil companion, and they would not receive him. George M\u00fcller, however, said that this was not fair. He said that many dear saints who were involved with the denominations were still very close to the Lord. He maintained that these believers could not be rejected and that they had to be received. This was the discrepancy between Darby and M\u00fcller, which led to another division among the Brethren. Thus, by this time there were three main groups among the Brethren\u2014Benjamin Newton\u2019s group, the closed Brethren, and the open Brethren. The so-called Plymouth Brethren in this country mainly refers to the open Brethren. Within ninety years after the formation of the Brethren in 1828, they were divided into over one hundred divisions.

Second, there are the Brethren, with Darby as their representative. He was the only one who dared to stand up to declare the desolate state of the church. Yet he himself was a proof that the church was not altogether desolate. Third, there are the Congregationalists who consider the local assembly to be the basic sphere of all activities. They do not see the church at large. For them there is not an issue over Protestantism or Catholicism but over church rule, which is based on the decision of the local congregation. Fourth, there are those who have adopted a system of bishops. They base their practice on the book of Timothy, in which Timothy was appointed by Paul to be an overseer, or bishop, over the elders. They regard a bishop as a chief elder. The chairman among the elders is the bishop, who is supposed to inherit all of the apostles\u2019 authority. From this practice comes the ordination of many pastors. These ones do not realize that the Bible considers elders and overseers (or bishops) as being the same group of people. Fifth, there are the Presbyterians. They say that the apostolic age is over, since the biblical apostles are all dead. However, they believe that we still have elders. Those who are ministering at the present time are the elders. This group does not believe in the desolation of the church either. Of the five groups, Catholicism is at one extreme, being completely autocratic, and the Brethren are at the other extreme, being completely democratic. The other three groups lie between Catholicism and Brethrenism. From each of these five groups many minor groups and sects have developed. When brothers like Darby were raised up, they had wonderful testimonies concerning church truth.

Darby began as an Anglican clergyman but later received light from the Lord and joined with others to practice the genuine church life. The Brethren movement [431] in England was a great improvement in the practice of the church life. However, their practice was not up to the highest standard, and the brothers were still not clear about a number of matters.

E. H. Broadbent, a prominent church historian among the brothers who were raised up in England, wrote a book entitled The Pilgrim Church. In that book he points out that the line of the Lord\u2019s recovery began from the second century and has never ceased throughout the centuries. After many years of degradation the Lord used Martin Luther to recover the basic truth of justification by faith. Then, during the seventeenth century the mystics, a group of believers that pursued the inner life, were raised up in the Catholic Church. That group, led by Madame Guyon, was used by the Lord to recover the experiences of the inner life. In the eighteenth century the Lord continued His recovery and used Count Zinzendorf to recover the church life in the oneness of [183] the Holy Spirit in an initial way. Then, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up the Brethren in England to recover the church life more completely under the leadership of J. N. Darby. That recovered church life among the brothers can be regarded as the fulfillment of the church in Philadelphia recorded in Revelation 3. However, within about a hundred years after the Brethren were raised up, they became divided again and again because of their different doctrinal views; hence, the Lord was forced to turn to China to continue His recovery.

The condition of these believers in the initial period of less than fifty years was wonderful. They received much light from the Lord, much of which concerned the truth of the church. They also unlocked almost all the types and prophecies in the Bible. Actually, our interpretation of the types in the Old Testament was helped very much by what the Brethren saw. Prior to the Brethren, some believers gradually and progressively received light concerning the types, but it was not until the time of the Brethren that almost all the types became unlocked.

Regrettably, they overly emphasized the interpretation of doctrines, which produced many different opinions and issued in the repetition of the mistake of the early church fathers in arguing over doctrines. Whenever excessive emphasis is placed on doctrines, such emphasis will issue in endless divisions. Among the Brethren, it was first J. N. Darby and B. W. Newton who argued over their different views on the rapture of the saints. Whereas Darby asserted that all the saints will be raptured before the great tribulation, Newton insisted that all the saints will be raptured after the great tribulation. The result of this disagreement was that the Brethren became divided into two groups. Shortly thereafter, the Brethren divided once again over a difference in the matter of receiving the believers. Darby insisted on not receiving any believers who were involved with denominational groups; however, those who were with George M\u00fcller continued to receive such people. This difference of opinion resulted in a division and produced the closed Brethren and open Brethren. Thus, about thirty years after the Brethren were raised up by the Lord, they had been divided into three main groups: the closed Brethren, the open Brethren, and the group led by Newton. From that time on, there have been countless divisions among them.

Darby asserted that because the denominations are condemned in the Bible, if a person is in a denomination, even though he is truly saved and loves the Lord, he is still an \u201cevil companion\u201d and should not be contacted. Another leader of the Brethren was George M\u00fcller, who was very excellent in his faith and Christian conduct. M\u00fcller told Darby, \u201cBrother, we cannot do this. I have a very close friend, Hudson Taylor, who loves the Lord very much yet is in a denomination. If he comes into our midst, will you not receive him?\u201d (Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, was the most spiritual and excellent one among the Western missionaries at that time. Even to this day I am still helped by his biography.) Darby answered, \u201cThat is right. Although he is very good, he is still an evil companion.\u201d Because of this dispute, the Brethren had their first great division. The majority among them stayed and followed Darby, while a group of them followed M\u00fcller. The latter group was called the open Brethren. They maintained that whether people are from the Catholic Church or the [113] Protestant denominations, as long as they are saved and have not committed gross sins, they should be accepted. Darby opposed such a practice. Thus, the ones who were under his leading became the closed Brethren.

But what is the antecedent of the pronoun Him, to whom all things are reconciled? The antecedent is the fullness spoken [84] of in verse 19. This is the reason that in his New Translation, J. N. Darby uses the pronouns itself and it, in verses 20 and 22, to refer to the fullness in verse 19. The Greek pronouns, however, should not be regarded as neuter, but as masculine. This means that instead of saying \u201cit,\u201d we should say \u201chim.\u201d Therefore, all things have been reconciled to the fullness. In verses 21 and 22, we who were enemies have been reconciled by the fullness in the body of flesh through death so that we may be presented holy and blameless and without reproach before the fullness.

Darby said that all the believers who remain in the denominations are companions of evil. He believed that since all the denominations are evil, as long as one joins them, he is a companion of evil. Therefore, he would not receive anyone who still remained in the denominations. George M\u00fcller disagreed, pointing out his friend, Hudson Taylor, who was the founder of the China Inland Mission. M\u00fcller asked Darby if he could say that Taylor was a companion of evil. This caused the division between the so-called closed Brethren and open Brethren. Darby was the first of the closed Brethren, while M\u00fcller was the first of the open Brethren. The closed Brethren went too far, even saying that if a husband and wife held different opinions, they should not eat together. Recently, there has been another big division among the closed Brethren. One faction says that the believers must examine everyone who wants to come to the Lord\u2019s table. Before receiving him, they have to study and investigate him. Otherwise, they cannot quickly receive him for [7] the Lord\u2019s table. Others, however, say that the believers should simply leave this matter to the Lord and let Him take care of it. These two opinions have existed for many years.

They hoped and determined that they could say with a pure conscience that every one of their practices was based on the Bible. Whenever they found a point in the Bible, they would practice according to that point; whatever traditional practice that did not have the Bible as its basis was rejected.

Darby has pointed out that in the Greek, the article in the English phrase in the Son is not present. A literal rendering of the Greek would read, \u201cGod...has...spoken to us in Son.\u201d Darby had a marvelous realization. He said that since there is no article, it must mean that God speaks in the person of the Son. There is only one God (Isa. 45:5; 1 Cor. 8:4), and the name of our God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). This is similar to the practice in many societies of naming one person with three names\u2014first, middle, and last. This is quite meaningful. M. R. Vincent indicated in his writing that a name always denotes a person. Thus, God\u2019s speaking \u201cin Son\u201d means that God speaks in the person of the Son. The [378] New Testament is very particular. From such a passage we can realize that God\u2019s speaking in the New Testament is in the way of incarnation.

He had an arrangement with some used bookstores in London that whenever they acquired a book for which he had placed an order, it was to be sent automatically. In this way he collected nearly all the classical Christian writings from the first century on. He acquired a collection of more than three thousand of the best Christian books, which included books on church history, biographies and autobiographies of outstanding Christians, and the central messages and commentaries of spiritual writers. When he was twenty-three years of age, his bedroom was nearly filled with books. There were books on the floor and a row of books on either side of his bed, with only a [26] narrow space in the middle to lie down. It was often said that he was buried in books. By reading these books, along with diligently studying the Bible, he not only acquired much learning concerning the content of the Bible; he also became balanced in his views. By such study he was also helped to realize more truths than all his predecessors. This greatly strengthened and enriched his ministry for the Lord\u2019s recovery.

Eventually, this brought about the first division among the so-called Brethren between those under the leadership of Darby and those under the leadership of Newton. I was associated with the Benjamin Newton group for seven and a half years during which time I learned all their teachings. They certainly had a strong ground for saying that the second coming of Christ would be after the great tribulation. If you [52] read the best writings of all the great teachers during the past one hundred fifty years, you will find that some taught that Christ\u2019s coming would be before the tribulation and others taught that it would follow the tribulation.

In describing the facts, however, the authors would often have the divine inspiration to insert a few words that did not match the situation at that time and that even the author himself might not have understood. The background of Isaiah 7:14, for example, is that Jehovah would give the children of Israel a sign. Thus, Isaiah received an inspiration and said, \u201cThe virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.\u201d [330] According to the background and the facts at that time, the Israelites did not understand what the ultimate fulfillment of this sign would be. However, in light of the New Testament and in view of this verse as a prophecy, it is clear that the ultimate fulfillment of this sign was Jesus Christ as God becoming flesh, being born of the virgin Mary, and having both divinity and humanity. Similarly, Psalm 68:18 speaks about the Israelites overcoming and capturing their enemies. At that time when they bore the Ark and ascended Mount Zion, they sang the victory song and distributed the spoils to all the people. The author of the psalm says, \u201cYou have ascended on high; You have led captive those taken captive; / You have received gifts... / That Jehovah God may dwell among them.\u201d This word was understandable to the people at that time, but the one phrase that they could not understand was, \u201cThou hast received gifts in Man, and even for the rebellious\u201d (Darby\u2019s New Translation). What the author expressed through inspiration did not fully match the situation at that time. He did not say that the spoils were distributed to the people. Rather, he prophesied that Christ would receive gifts in man for the rebellious. This is a very special expression, which includes the thought of prophecy, indicating that gifts would be received from God. However, when the apostle Paul quotes this word in Ephesians, he speaks not of receiving gifts but of giving gifts to men.

The lie mentioned in the beginning of this verse comes from the deceit in the old man, because all the elements in the deceit are lies (v. 22).

The book was also regarding the meeting life among us. In the beginning we were strongly influenced by the light of the Brethren. J. N. Darby, the first leader among the Brethren, said in one of his books that the age of the apostles has passed, so after the first century there are no more apostles on the earth. Because there is no apostle on the earth, no one can appoint elders, and because no one can be an official elder, there is no gathering that can be called a church. This is a very important point. Until today this teaching is still held among the Brethren. However, in these Bible-study meetings Brother Nee received some light and could not agree with the Brethren in this matter. Thus, Brother Nee used the term unofficial. He said that even though we are not apostles, as the Lord\u2019s workers, what we are doing is almost the same as what the early apostles did. [57] Hence, we can be called unofficial apostles. Since there are unofficial apostles, they have the authority and the position to appoint unofficial elders, and since there are unofficial elders, there are unofficial churches.

The flow of the Spirit moves on progressively. The book of Acts reveals that the Lord as the Spirit flowed from Jerusalem to Antioch; then from Antioch the Spirit flowed to Asia Minor and to Europe.

In translating the New [296] Testament, the King James translators did not use the personal pronouns He, Him, or His with regard to the Spirit; they still used it, its, and itself. This indicated that they did not consider the Holy Spirit to be a person. According to this concept, the Father in the Trinity is a person, and the Son is also a person, but the Spirit is not. They considered the Spirit just as a means, a channel, or an instrument by which the Father and the Son accomplish something.

Thus, all the churches can have only responsible brothers. However, Brother Nee received new light during those Bible study meetings and no longer considered the view of the Brethren as accurate. Thus, he began to use the term unofficial in referring to the apostles and the elders. He said, \u201cAlthough we do not have the official title of an elder, we can find men in all the localities who resemble elders and who are doing the work of an elder.

During the past five centuries God has opened His Word again and again through many great teachers. In particular, God raised up the British Brethren to interpret His Word in a proper way. During the early part of the nineteenth century, the light in the Word came to the Brethren like a flood. For instance, the seventeenth-century edition of the King James Version of the Bible used the impersonal pronoun it in referring to the Holy Spirit because the translators understood the Holy Spirit as an instrument used by God, not as a person equally ranked with the other two in the Divine Trinity. The Brethren pointed out that the Holy Spirit is a person in the Godhead. As a result, many of the English translations of the Bible published after the nineteenth century adopted the personal pronoun He in referring to the Spirit. The great Bible teachers among the Brethren, such as John Nelson Darby, William Kelly, and C. H. Mackintosh, expounded the types and prophecies in the Word. We in the Lord\u2019s recovery have received much help from the Bible teachers among the Brethren, and much of our interpretation of the Bible is based on their teachings. D. L. Moody said that if all other books in the world were to be burned, he would be satisfied to have a copy of the Bible and a copy of C. H. Mackintosh\u2019s Notes on the Pentateuch. Although Dr. C. I. Scofield rejected the Brethren way of practicing the church life, he adopted nearly all the teachings of the Brethren. Both his reference Bible and correspondence courses are based on the Brethren\u2019s dispensationalist theology.

Without the proper interpretation of the Bible, there would be no recovery among us. The hundreds of missionaries who came from Europe and America brought the Bible to China, translated the Bible into Chinese, and preached from the Bible. These missionaries mainly taught that Jesus is the Son of God who loves us and died on the cross for our sins and that if we believe in Him, we will be saved from the lake of fire. Although this gospel is correct, it is shallow. Among the missionaries there were very few who could expound the Bible in an adequate way by interpreting the various types, prophecies, and dispensations. The Lord raised up Brother Watchman Nee with the help of Sister Margaret E. Barber in order to recover the divine truths in the Bible. Although Sister Barber was not in the Lord\u2019s recovery among us in mainland China, she was very deep in the spiritual life, and she greatly edified and perfected Brother Nee. Through Sister Barber, Brother Nee became familiar with the books of D. M. Panton, Robert Govett, G. H. Pember, Jessie Penn-Lewis, T. Austin-Sparks, and others. He also collected the writings of the Brethren teachers, such as John Nelson Darby, William Kelly, and C. H. Mackintosh. In addition to these writings, he collected many classical Christian writings, including books on church history, biographies and autobiographies of outstanding Christians, and the central messages and commentaries of spiritual writers.

During the 1820s, the Lord raised up a group of brothers in England. Among them were many great teachers. They saw much light in the Bible. [24] The leading one among these brothers was J. N. Darby. By examining the revelation of the whole Bible, he saw that all the churches should be identical. As a result, he suggested that all the churches be unified. This term unified is not very sound doctrinally. The churches should be identical, but the churches cannot be unified. To be identical is one thing; it means that everything is the same. But to be unified has a political sense. When one speaks of unification, there is the sense of a federation like that of the United States of America. This, of course, is wrong for the church. Although to be identical and to be unified are similar terms, in meaning they are totally different.

One was called the Closed Brethren; the other, the Open Brethren. Among the Open Brethren there was one teacher by the name of G. H. Lang. He wrote many books, one of which is called The Churches of God. In that book he claims that every local church should be an autonomy. This [25] would be like the autonomy of every one of the fifty states in the United States. Each is governed by itself. These fifty states then are fifty autonomies. This stirred up a great controversy in truth. Lang condemned Darby\u2019s unification, calling it a federation. In Lang\u2019s book both terms, autonomy and federation, are used. In this respect, neither of the two brothers were clear about the ground of the church. Darby felt that all the assemblies meeting in the city of London should be unified. But Lang argued that such a unification would be a federation. Because of this, Lang proposed that every local church (assembly) should be an isolated autonomy. Each local church (assembly) should be clearly separated from the others. Because of this teaching, great damage was brought in among the Brethren. Today they are divided into pieces.

In a general way, under their hand the prophecies concerning the Lord\u2019s second coming were crystallized. In particular, J. N. Darby made the greatest contribution. However, the logic in his line of thought was somewhat deficient, and the details regarding the Lord\u2019s second coming were not made sufficiently clear. Later, the Lord raised up G. H. Pember, who was well versed in biblical prophecy, especially in the history of the prophecies. He wrote four books concerning the prophecies of the Bible. One of them, entitled The Great Prophecies, covers the prophecies concerning the Jews, the Gentiles, and the church; the other three also cover the prophecies concerning the Jews, the Gentiles, and the church, respectively. These four books may be considered the foundation of the study of biblical prophecy. Everyone who pursues the knowledge of the prophecies in the Bible is helped by these four books. Pember [583] was well versed in the history of the biblical prophecies, and his study in this matter was excellent. For example, concerning the vision of the struggle between the ram and the male goat in Daniel 8, Pember realized that the male goat signifies the Grecian Empire, and the ram, the Persian Empire, because the symbol of ancient Greece was the goat, and the symbol of Persia was the ram.

Today when people read our books and come to see us, they cannot see the model of the revelation that we have received. Therefore, we need a revival in order to become a model of the vision that we have seen. In the entire recovery there must be the practicality that is up to the standard of what we have seen (cf.

He thought that it was logical to leave the Anglican Church and join the Roman Church since there was only one church. After being received as a member of the Roman Church, he was promoted to the position of cardinal over England. A cardinal is next in rank only to the pope. He was not only a bishop but a cardinal. There was only one cardinal in England; he was the archbishop of a large region. When a pope passes away, the new pope is chosen from among the scores of cardinals. Many people have expressed regret for Newman, but in reading his books, I feel that his beginning was consistent with his end. I do not say that he was right, but his behavior matched his doctrine. He believed in only one church; therefore, he went back to Rome. One should not believe in one church and yet remain in the denominations. One should not confess that the church is one and be a pastor in the Anglican Church or an elder in the Presbyterian Church. Newman was thoroughly consistent and uncontradicting.

In addition to the place being dedicated, the person preaching the message had to be ordained; no ordinary person was allowed to preach. This is the reason Darby said that Paul, Peter, and John could not have preached according to this view, because they were not ordained. For the state churches, preaching was serious, location was serious, and [371] setting up new churches was even more serious. Even Luther, during the Reformation, dared not establish a church.

Men who were greatly used by the Lord in the past, such as Luther and Darby, discovered many important truths in the Bible, but they did not uncover all the truths. When we read the Bible, if we limit ourselves to traditional theology and take the Bible students of the past as our model, we will be under a rigid limitation and lose the living light, and we will be able to inherit only the past truths without receiving fresh revelation.

All sicknesses are factors of death. Actually, before resurrection comes, everyone who is healed receives but a temporary healing. Today in times of necessity, God gives us limited healing. He allows us to live a few more years on this earth, but it is not for our health or for our longevity but for His will. "}]}
