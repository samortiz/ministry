   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S SELECTION IN HIS MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For this crucial point we have to read 9:14-18.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By studying these verses along with the Life-study Messages, you will get a clear picture of God s selection in His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 9:16 tells us that it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our concept is that the one who wills will get what he wills to get and that the one who runs will gain what he runs after.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If this were the case, then God s selection would be according to our effort and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But it is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is altogether of God who shows mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not need to will or to run, for God has mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do know God s mercy, we will not put our trust in our efforts; neither will we be disappointed by our failure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The hope for our wretched condition is God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>VESSELS OF MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TO HONOR AND UNTO GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 9:20-24 says that man was made a vessel and that this vessel is a vessel to honor because God is contained in this vessel 2 Cor 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The contents of the vessel is a Person of high honor, so this container is called a vessel to honor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, this vessel will be brought into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, the contents of the vessel will saturate this vessel with Himself who is the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the glory saturates the entire vessel, the vessel will be in glory, so it is unto glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being vessels to honor is not the result of our choice; it originates with God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is of God s sovereignty that He makes His glory known by creating vessels of mercy to contain Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to His sovereign authority, God before prepared us unto glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were predestinated by His sovereignty to be His containers, vessels to honor to express what He is in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That is not only a matter of His mercy, but also of His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>ENJOYING THE RICHES OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BY CALLING ON HIS NAME</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 10:12 and 13 say, For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be saved here means to be brought into the enjoyment of the riches of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord is rich both to the Jews and to the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the rich Lord of all the peoples who call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we call Lord Jesus, we are calling upon the Lord because His name is His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of enjoyment is the filling up of the vessel in Romans 9.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The vessel in chapter nine can only be filled up with the riches of the Lord by our calling on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A GRAFTED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans 11:17 says, But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and became a fellow partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 9, 10, and 11 are on God s selection by His mercy and these three chapters show us that the olive tree refers to God s chosen people, the real children of Israel, not in the physical sense, but in the spiritual sense.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Romans 9:6 says that not all are Israel who are out of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The children of the flesh are not the children of God but the children of the promise 9:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the olive tree refers to the genuine people of God s selection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This tree includes us because we all have been grafted into this tree, of which Christ is the root.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The wild branches are grafted into this cultivated olive tree to partake of Christ as the root of this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Romans 11:17 refers to the root of the fatness of the olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fatness refers to the riches of this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is the root of the riches of this cultivated olive tree which is somewhat like the vine in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The vine is the divine organism for God to dispense Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In John 15, though, we cannot see the grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fact that we Gentiles were grafted into the divine organism of the Triune God is revealed in Romans 11.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We were branches of the wild olive tree, which means that we were born in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But we were transferred into Christ by being grafted into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, we become the cultivated olive tree, which is somewhat like the grapevine in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now we are enjoying Christ as the fatness, the riches, of this divine organism for God to dispense Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Studying the Life-study Messages of Romans and some of the Life-study Messages related to John 15 will help you get into this crucial point of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE BELIEVERS TRIPARTITE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nearly every teacher of the book of Romans knows that chapter twelve is on the practice of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to practice the Body of Christ we first have to consecrate our body v. 1 . Second, we have to be renewed in our mind, which means that our soul has to be renewed v. 2 . Finally, our spirit has to be on fire v. 11 . The three parts of our being all need to be exercised for the practice of the Body of Christ.</S>
