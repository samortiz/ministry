Without the heavenly vision in the spirit we may read through, study, and even research the Bible, yet still not see it
God's grace has an economy called the economy of the grace of God which is to dispense God Himself in Christ into us
They did not know because Paul in Ephesians 3 said that this mystery was not made known to the sons of men in other generations
In the past generations, the generations of Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Elijah, Isaiah, etc
Confucius, Socrates, and Plato were common, but here are some apostles who are holy, not ordinary, regular, or common
They are the separated ones, because they have seen something which human beings and the saints of God have never seen
They only realize the need of God's salvation so that they will not perish in hell but be rescued and brought to heaven
They feel that while on earth they are here just to display good Christian behavior to glorify God and to help people
We need to read, study, and pray over Colossians and Ephesians, for they unveil to us the mystery of God, Christ
Christ is wonderful because He is the mystery, the answer, the definition, the embodiment, and the reality of God
We do know that the whole universe is the mystery of God, this mystery of God is just Christ, and this mystery of Christ is the church
According to our feeling, our conversion might have been an accident, but it was actually part of God's economy
God has given this stewardship to some of His chosen ones, such as the apostles who have been much used by the Lord
As a result, the more that we are in the stewardship, the more we are under the administration to carry out God's mystery
Whenever we meet together we have God's dispensing, we have the stewardship, and we are under the administration
If we would study Genesis chapter one in Hebrew, we could see that the title used for God is not a singular noun
When God came to the point where He was related to man, He revealed Himself in such a triune way, denoting that He is the Triune God
On the eternal side or end, God is the Father, and at this end of the age as the One given to us, He is the Son
He is called the Father of eternity, but for Him to dispense Himself into humanity, He must be a Son given to us
When you receive the Son, you just receive God, and in your prayer you do not call Him Son, but you call Him Father
When we come to the New Testament, the Gospel of John says, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
How wonderful that this very God who was the Word took the initiative to become a man that He might be the Lamb to take away our sins!
In order to dispense Himself into sinners, He must become a man to be the redeeming Lamb to take away our sins
After accomplishing redemption, the last Adam who was the very flesh and the very man became a life-giving Spirit!
Even though the room where the disciples were was closed and no door was open, all of a sudden He was in their midst
After His resurrection He appeared to His disciples, not in the sense of the Lamb, but in the actuality of the breath, the Spirit
In John 14 while the Lord was talking to His disciples, one of the disciples, Philip, asked, 'Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us'
After this clear vision, the Lord Jesus went on to say, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter'
John 14:17 reveals that this other Comforter is the Spirit of reality who came first to be among the disciples and then to abide in them
These two revelations are found in John-one concerning the Son being the Father and the other concerning the Son being the Spirit
Now we all can see that the Father in the Son becoming the Spirit has come into us, and we all have been put into the very Triune God
The second is to become the life-giving Spirit that we may call on Him, that the Spirit may get into us, and that we may be put into Him
Who can deny that this very God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is right now within us, and we are right now in Him?
Paul prayed to the Father that we might be strengthened by the Spirit into our inner man that Christ may make His home in us
He prayed that eventually, we may be able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth
The more we pray to Him, the more we call on His name, the more we feel that He becomes one with us, and we become one with Him!
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
An old man is sitting there with a long beard, a young man is standing there as the Son, and a dove is soaring above as the Spirit
We are no more merely human beings; we are now human beings saturated, immersed, and infused with the Triune God
God also created the hair within our throat upward but all the rest of our hair throughout our whole body downward
Regardless of whether we are old, young, rich, poor, high, or low, with every human being there is the sense of emptiness
While arguing with you that there is no God, deep within they ask, 'Suppose there is a God, what should we do'?
Whether we call that the spirit, the appetite, the receiver, or the hollowness, whatever we call it, there is such a thing
The dust with which our body was formed is a material matter, but the breath which is the very element for our spirit is spiritual
One is the material element, the dust for the body; the other is the spiritual element, the breath of God for our spirit
The Apostle Paul told us clearly in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 that a human being is composed with three parts-the spirit and soul and body
Just as a jacket was designed to fit the physical body, so man was made, not by accident but according to God's design
Man was made according to God's fashion with a soul, and the soul is of three parts: the mind, the emotion, and the will
The emotion, being our inner organ to love, to hate, to be happy or sorrowful, goes along with our mind as well
We used our body in bodily exercise and our mind for education and schooling, but we were never taught to exercise our spirit
The Bible says that the very God is the One who stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man
God is Spirit, and we have a spirit within us as an organ for us to worship God, contact God, commune with God, receive God, and contain God
When the Bible says, 'The Lord be with your spirit,' it means that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is with our spirit
As Christians, if we are honest and faithful to the Lord, we have to walk according to this mingled spirit in everything every day
We are here for the Lord's recovery, and the Lord's recovery is focused on the church which is the mystery of Christ
Now we have to learn how to worship the Spirit in our spirit, learn how to contact Him, learn how to fellowship with Him
The life-giving Spirit as the ultimate expression of the Triune God has entered into our human spirit to make Himself one with our spirit
It is in the spirit that we fully realize that the best, the top portion, of God's blessing is with the church
The King James Version says, 'baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost'
It does not mean baptizing them in the name but baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit
Besides Matthew 28:19, this phrase baptizing into is used in Romans 6:3 where it says that we have been baptized into the death of Christ
We have to baptize people into four things: into the name, into Christ, into the death of Christ, and into the Body
When we baptize people into the water, it denotes that we baptize them into the name, into Christ, into His death, and into His Body
To baptize people is to baptize them into the name, into Christ, into His all-inclusive death, and into His Body
After the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the first mention of baptism is not to baptize people into the water, into the tomb, or into death
After 1942, Brother Nee gave messages telling us that the real experience of Christ's death is not in Romans 6 but in Romans 8
We put them into the name, into the compound Spirit, and into the death of Christ which is one of the compounding elements of the Spirit
When we put them into the name, into Christ, and into His death, at the same time we baptize them into the Body
If this were the case it would be right to immerse people into three names but the name is singular in number that is three with one name
If the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three distinct Persons, how could three distinct Persons have just one name?
We put people into whatever the Father is as the source, whatever the Son is as the course, and whatever the Spirit is as the flow
To baptize people into Christ is equal to baptizing people into the name of the Triune God because Christ is the reality of the Triune God
We are not only enjoying Christ's crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, we are now experiencing His immersion
Our mind has been soaked with the Spirit, and the Spirit, which was separate from our mind, now becomes the spirit of our mind
Our mind, emotion, will-the way we think, the way we love, and the way we make decisions-have all been permeated by this spreading spirit
We can say that we are the church, we are the mystery of Christ, and we are parts of Christ in a mysterious way
When we look into the whole Bible, it may be very hard to find the kernel if we stay with our mentality and do not exercise our spirit
We can see the parts of the physical body such as the skin, the meat, the bone, and the muscle, but we cannot see the physical life
All of these are different aspects of one mystery, and this mystery in the two books to Timothy is called the mystery of godliness
As a young male of the race of Israel you must be circumcised on the eighth day and this is once for your whole life
The kernel of the Bible is this: the mystery of the universe is God, the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church
Paul charged Timothy to take care of some and tell them that they should not teach differently, but speak the same thing
Many other doctrines such as the seventy weeks with the seven last years in Daniel can raise question after question
The Lord's recovery is to bring us back to the beginning, to a beginning without any questions, and to a beginning without any division
We care for a living testimony to our in-laws, our cousins, our neighbors, our classmates, our schoolmates, and our colleagues
We care for the complete gospel of God to be preached to the sinners for the proper church life and for taking Christ as our life and person
Some have missed the goal, thinking that they are teachers who can teach people this doctrine and that doctrine
If we are going to express this mystery, if we are going to practice this mystery, then we all have to exercise our spirit
Let us suppose that while a few single brothers are living together, one comes in and starts to talk about some worldly things
While this brother is talking about worldly things, right away the others have to exercise their spirit not to join that talk
Suppose that after a meeting a married brother goes back home, and his dear wife suddenly becomes unhappy with him
We are drinking all the day of this Triune God in our spirit, and whatever we do, we exercise ourselves unto godliness
Our burden, commission, and mission is to have such a church life upon the earth today in all the major cities
We only care for God's mystery, God's economy, Christ and the church, and the Triune God dispensing Himself into us
The full recovery of the Lord today is just a proper church life in which we live by Christ and exercise ourselves unto godliness
