   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE A SUMMARY OF THE EXHORTATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN CHAPTER FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall present a summary of Paul s exhortation in chapter five, concentrating on love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that firstly we receive God in Christ as grace and realize God in Christ as truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we come to enjoy God as love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Love and light are inward elements, whereas grace and truth are outward elements.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, the exhortation in 5:1-33 is deeper than that in 4:17-32.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Love is the inner substance of God that can be sensed, and light is the expressed element of God that can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the revelation of Ephesians 5, both love and light are to be the inner source of our walk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>BASIC ELEMENTS AND BASIC FACTORS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul s writing in Ephesians is both profound and deep.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As he was writing this Epistle, he drew upon the deep concepts that were within him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These deeper concepts are the basic elements and basic factors in each chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our reading of Ephesians, we must endeavor to determine what these basic elements and basic factors are, for they are the very components of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have pointed out that the basic elements in chapter four are grace and truth and that the basic elements in chapter five are love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Along with these basic elements, there are the basic factors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapters four and five Paul s intention is not simply to give a number of exhortations regarding stealing, putting off falsehood, submission, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, many pay attention to such details, but not to the basic elements and basic factors.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have seen that in chapter four the basic factors, on the positive side, are the life of God and the Spirit of God and, on the negative side, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we must go on to see that the most important basic factor in this chapter is the church as the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the exhortation here is related to this aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The main factor in chapter five is the church as the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, just as Paul s exhortation in chapter four is related to the new man, so his exhortation in chapter five is related to the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE KEY TO CHAPTER FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Remember, the subject of the book of Ephesians is not behavior or virtue; it is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In giving us the long exhortation recorded in chapter four, Paul never loses sight of his main point the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As he presents the principle and the details, he is fully conscious of the church as the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the living described in chapter four must be for the church as the new man; that is, the church as the new man must be according to truth and by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the new man, the church should live a life according to God s standard, according to the truth as it is in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The only way the church as the new man can have such a life is by God s all-sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This grace supplies us so that we may live according to the mold, the model, the pattern, of the life of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the key to chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we apply this key in our reading of this chapter, the entire chapter will be open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Keep in mind that Ephesians 4 deals with the church as the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we would be the church in this aspect, we must live a life according to the standard of the truth as it is in Jesus and by God s all-sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>LOVE AND LIGHT IN CHAPTER FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the same principle, the main point in chapter five is the church as the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The main point is not Paul s exhortation regarding wives submitting to their own husbands or husbands loving their own wives.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the Bride, the church needs something finer and deeper than truth and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is the need for love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Truth is not as fine as light, and grace is not as deep or intimate as love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With respect to the church as the Bride, in chapter five Paul speaks of love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fact that the church as the Bride requires a living in love and in light can be proved by our own experience in married life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a husband and wife live together merely by grace and according to truth, their married life will be very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If my wife were to deal with me according to grace but offer me no love, I would be extremely dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She would feel the same if I dealt with her according to grace without love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Married life is based not upon grace, but upon love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In like manner, married life is based not upon truth, but upon light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How pitiful it would be if a husband and wife were always considering the right way to behave toward each other.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For the intimate relationship between husband and wife, mere truth is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There must be light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, a proper marriage is not merely according to truth and by grace, but is in love and in light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is your married life according to truth and by grace, or is it in love and in light?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose a wife says to her husband, Everything I do for you is according to truth and by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nothing I do is wrong or false.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Furthermore, everything is by the Lord s sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This does not sound like the intimacy of a marriage, but sounds like the coldness of a law court.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In married life the relationship between wife and husband should be fine, bright, and intimate.</S>
