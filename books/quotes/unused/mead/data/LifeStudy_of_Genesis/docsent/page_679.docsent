   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REIGNING ASPECT OF THE MATURED ISRAEL 8</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have pointed out a number of times, in the story of Joseph there are two lines: the line of the type and the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we consider further the line of life, we need to see another point regarding Joseph as a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>17 Reigning</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Joseph was a type of Christ reigning in His kingdom during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we take note of the prophecy in the story of Joseph, we shall see that his record is a picture of Christ's reign in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>a Supplying People with Food</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to this picture, Christ will do four things during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, He will supply people with food, that is, He will satisfy everyone's needs 47:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the whole earth was under a famine, Joseph was able to satisfy everyone's hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today everyone is hungry and no one is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when Christ is reigning during the coming thousand years, He will meet everyone's need and satisfy everyone's hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>b Keeping People Alive</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As Joseph was reigning in Egypt, he kept people alive 47:19, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because Christ will satisfy everyone's needs, He will be able to make everyone alive, to make everyone living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you examine the prophecies regarding Christ's reign in the millennium, you will see that Christ will make everything living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, death is everywhere; everyone and everything is dying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But during the millennial reign of Christ, there will be hardly a sign of death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, everything and everyone will be full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>c Keeping the Land Producing</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Joseph also kept the land producing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He gave the people not only food, but also seed 47:19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the millennium Christ will make everything productive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In today's situation, on the contrary, everything is diminishing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when the millennium comes, everything on earth will be productive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to produce, we must have seed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While food is for satisfaction, seed is for production.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As He reigns in the millennium, Christ will not only afford people food to satisfy them, but supply them with seed to make them productive.</S>
