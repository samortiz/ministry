[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE GOD-MEN AND THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 2:15-16; 4:22-24; Col 3:10-11 OUTLINE The God-men: Born of God to be His sons John 1:12-13; Heb 2:10.
[3]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You that by Your mercy and grace we can be here, gathered together into You.
[4]  The six chapters of this book cover four major topics: the first, the God-men and the new man; the second, the God-men and the Body of Christ; the third, the God-men and the overcomers; and the last, the God-men and the New Jerusalem.
[5]  I. THE GOD-MEN A. Born of God to Be His Sons
[6]  As those who are born of God, the God-men have not only the divine life but also the divine nature.
[7]  Thank God that in the Bible, among the sixty-six books, there is one verse, 2 Peter 1:4, that says that we are partakers of the divine nature, which is the nature of God.
[8]  G. For the Manifestation of God in the Flesh as the New Man
[9]  According to the context of this verse, godliness here refers not only to piety but also to the living of God in the church, that is, to God as life lived out in the church.
[10]  Ephesians 2:15 says, " that He Christ might create the two in Himself into one new man."
[11]  E. To Be the One New Man for the Body of Christ
[12]  To build up the Body, the God-men as the constituents of the new man must be raised up by growing up Eph 4:15 .
[13]  It is to raise up the God-men to grow unto maturity, so that these God-men will do the work of building up the Body of Christ vv.
[14]  THE INTRINSIC CONTENT OF THE TEACHING OF THE BIBLE
[15]  In this chapter we have covered three main things: the God-men, the new man, and the new creation.
[16]  The God-men are the believers in Christ, who are reborn of God to be His sons.
[17]  CHAPTER TWO THE GOD-MEN AND THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 4:2-6, 11-16 OUTLINE The God-men: The God-men as the children of God are the members of the Body of Christ Rom 12:5.
[18]  The God-men as the stewards Luke 12:42; Col 1:25 struggle for the growth and maturity of the Body of Christ Col 1:28-29: Until it becomes a full-grown man with the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Eph 4:13.
[19]  The God-men as the myriads of the multiplied reproduction of the Triune God consummate the Body of Christ as His increase John 3:30 and fullness Eph 1:23 to be the corporate enlargement and fullness as the expression of the processed and consummated Triune God Eph 3:19 .
[20]  In this chapter we will consider the God-men and the Body of Christ.
[21]  The Body of Christ is also a mystical and spiritual Body.
[22]  The organism of the Triune God is consummated also by its building up of itself in love v. 16 . Love is the inner substance of God.
[23]  Thus, the love in which the Body of Christ builds itself up is not our own love but the love of God in Christ, which becomes the love of Christ in us.
[24]  CHAPTER THREE THE GOD-MEN AND THE OVERCOMERS Scripture Reading: Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21 OUTLINE The God-men: Born of God to overcome sin and the world 1 John 3:9; 5:4.
[25]  Destined by God to conquer all the oppositions and persecutions, the hard environments, and the difficult situations Rom 8:31, 36-39.
[26]  The way for the God-men to be the overcomers is first to love Christ and follow Him John 21:15-17, 19b .
[27]  The God-men as the overcomers must also pursue Christ and gain Him Phil 3:12-15 , and they must be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection v. 10 . In everything we need to be conformed to Christ's death.
[28]  V. THE BLESSING OF GOD'S COMPLETE SALVATION, THAT IS, THE ENJOYMENT OF THE ETERNAL LIFE FOR ALL THE GOD-MEN IN THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH
[29]  After being perfected and matured, the defeated believers will join with the overcoming God-men to enjoy the eternal blessing of God's complete salvation in the new heaven and new earth Matt 19:29; Rom 5:21 .
[30]  In the enjoyment of God's complete salvation, the God-men will participate in the holy city the New Jerusalem in its consummated stage as their temple the Triune God Himself for their dwelling in eternity Rev 22:14b; 21:22 .
[31]  They will also participate in the divine and human marriage life of the processed and consummated Triune God and the transformed and glorified tripartite man v. 9 . This is not the wedding, which will be a reward to the overcomers in the millennium; this is the marriage life of the believers with the Triune God for eternity.
[32]  CHAPTER FOUR THE GOD-MEN AND THE NEW JERUSALEM 1 Scripture Reading: Rev 21 22 OUTLINE The God-men: The God-men constitute the new man to be the constituents of the New Jerusalem.
[33]  The God-men build up the Body of Christ for the building of the New Jerusalem.
[34]  An organic constitution constituted with the redeeming processed and consummated Triune God and the redeemed, transformed, and glorified tripartite men as an organism of the consummated Triune God for His eternal enlargement and expression through the glorified tripartite men.
[35]  18-24; Eph 5:22-29: a The wife came out of the husband signifying Christ as a part a rib, signifying the resurrection life of Christ of him taken out of him in his sleep signifying the death of Christ by God, which part God built into a woman signifying the church Gen 2:21-22a. b God brought the woman to the man and made her one flesh with him as her husband to be his counterpart as his increase and expression vv.
[36]  4 The entire city of New Jerusalem being a couple: a The processed and consummated redeeming Triune God in Christ is the Husband. b The chosen and redeemed people of the redeeming Triune God are the wife, produced by the processed and consummated Triune God through Christ's death and resurrection with the divine life of the redeeming God as the element to be His counterpart as His enlargement and expression in eternity 21:2, 9; Eph 1:23; 3:19.
[37]  I. 4. a. 3 . Its gates with its availability 21:12b-13, 21a: The Old Testament saints, signified by the pearls, produced by God the Son through His redeeming and life-releasing death and His life-dispensing resurrection, are the gates: 1 An oyster Christ lives in the salty water the world of death and is wounded by a grain of sand crucified for the sinner to produce a pearl by secreting its life juice dispensing His life element . 2 The gates are in the number of twelve eternal completion and perfection in administration , which is composed of three the Triune God times mingles four man as God's creature , signifying that the Triune God mingles with man as His creature for His administration to accomplish His economy.
[38]  In the previous three chapters we covered mainly the God-men, the new man, the new creation, the Body of Christ, the overcomers, and, in a simple way, the New Jerusalem.
[39]  In this chapter we will begin to consider the New Jerusalem in a detailed way, pointing out the significance of the New Jerusalem and giving a definition and interpretation of the glorious New Jerusalem.
[40]  C. The God-men Becoming the Overcomers to Consummate the New Jerusalem
[41]  D. The Dwelling Place of the Processed and Consummated Triune God
[42]  Revelation 21:3 says clearly that the New Jerusalem, the holy city, is the tabernacle of God.
[43]  a. The Revelation concerning the Garden of Eden, as the Beginning of the Divine Revelation in the Holy Scripture
[44]  The next aspect of this organic building is its gates with its availability 21:12b-13, 21a . a. The Old Testament Saints, Signified by the Pearls, Produced by God the Son through His Redeeming and Life-releasing Death and His Life-dispensing Resurrection, Being the Gates
[45]  CHAPTER FIVE THE GOD-MEN AND THE NEW JERUSALEM 2 Scripture Reading: Rev 21 22 OUTLINE The New Jerusalem: The unique, divine, and organic building in the entire universe: Its wall with its foundations 21:12a, 14, 15b, 17-20: The New Testament believers, signified by the precious stones, consummated by God the Spirit in His transforming and building work, are the wall and its foundations v. 18a: 1 The wall built with jasper separates the organic building from the nations around it.
[46]  2 The wall is the appearance of this organic building, which is the appearance of precious jasper.
[47]  This is also the appearance of God 4:3 , indicating that this organic building is just the expression of God shining as jasper, a most precious stone 21:11.
[48]  Its center with its administration and supply 22:1-2: The center is the throne of God and of the Lamb the redeeming Triune God , which signifies that the administration of this organic building is: 1 Built on the base God the Father's nature as its foundation cf.
[49]  1 The Wall Built with Jasper Separating the Organic Building from the Nations around It
[50]  The wall of the New Jerusalem built with jasper separates the organic building from the nations around it.
[51]  3 Flowing Out the River of Water of Life, on the Two Sides of Which the Tree of Life Grows
[52]  The administration in the New Jerusalem as the divine, organic building flows out the river of water of life the consummated life-giving Spirit, as the consummation of the consummated Triune God John 7:38-39; 4:14 in the middle of the street, and on the two sides of the river grows the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ, as the embodiment of the consummated Triune God Rev 2:7; 22:14 , signifying the supply of this organic building cf. section II.
[53]  In this mutual abode, where both God and His redeemed abide, the redeeming God as the Father with the redeemed as the Father's many sons form a royal household. d.
[54]  CHAPTER SIX THE GOD-MEN AND THE NEW JERUSALEM 3 Scripture Reading: Rev 21 22 OUTLINE The New Jerusalem: The unique, divine, and organic building in the entire universe: Its reign with its subjects 21:24, 26, 3-4; 22:2b: The divine royal household, as kings under the Father as the King of kings, reign within this organic building 22:3b-5 over the nations around it as its subjects 21:24, 26; cf.
[55]  They are the sheep, the righteous of the nations, justified by Christ at His throne of glory in His coming back according to the eternal gospel, not the gospel of grace, preached by an angel during the great tribulation Rev 14:6-7 that they may inherit the kingdom prepared by God for them from the foundation of the world , that is, enter into eternal life to participate in the eternal blessing of the eternal life Matt 25:31-40, 46.
[56]  The more I engage in the crystallization-study of the New Jerusalem as it is unveiled in Revelation 21 and 22, the more I worship God for His revelation.
[57]  Before we consider further aspects of the New Jerusalem, I would like to review the main points we have covered thus far regarding the New Jerusalem as the unique, divine, and organic building in the entire universe.
[58]  In reviewing these matters I am burdened to point out that every aspect of the New Jerusalem as an organic building is nothing other than the Triune God as the redeeming God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people.
[59]  In the New Jerusalem we have God the Father in His nature as the base and the street, God the Son as the Creator through His death and resurrection and with Himself as the element producing the gates, God the Spirit with His transforming and building work building the wall with its foundations, and the Old and New Testament saints as the materials.
[60]  When we put all this together, we have the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people.
[61]  The answer to this question is that we must pass through the death and resurrection of Christ to have our fallen humanity terminated and to have our original, God-created humanity redeemed and recovered so that Christ can use us as the materials.
[62]  These subjects will be God's peoples, among whom is the tabernacle of God.
