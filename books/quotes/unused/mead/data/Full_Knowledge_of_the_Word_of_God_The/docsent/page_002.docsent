   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Beginning this morning we will have five days of training meetings on service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every brother and sister in the church has a part.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not only the elders and co-workers who serve, but every brother and sister in the church is a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before the meeting you received the outline for this message.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the outline there are Scripture verses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before I came downstairs, I told a few of the co-workers not to tell you how to read the verses because I wanted to see how you would do it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I watched carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your prayers were quite good, but you prayed without stopping.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I had no choice, so I asked someone to write two verses on the blackboard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then he said, "Let us pray-read."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After he said this, you began to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You should know that time is limited in a training; therefore, after you have prayed a little while, you should begin to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>EVERYONE BEING ABLE TO PRAY AND TO READ IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever we gather together, we enter into the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have been called out of everything to be gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit is within us, and the Word of the Lord is in our hands; therefore, we can read and we can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not have a pastor, and even though we have elders, they are not elders in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the meetings, everyone is equal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have many co-workers, but they are not co-workers in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their work is to preach the gospel on the campuses, to lead people to be saved, to hold special meetings, and to take care of the saints in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the church gathers together, we all have the Word of the Lord, and we also have the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can use our eyes to read the Lord's Word, our mind to understand the Lord's Word, and our spirit to pray over and receive the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all can do these things, just as everyone can breathe, drink, eat, and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all are living people, not robots.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The God whom we serve is also living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not serving dumb idols.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we come to the meetings, we desire to overturn the way of practice in Christianity, which stifles the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For several decades we have been trying to overturn this way, but sometimes the more we tried the more we fell back into it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I came back to Taiwan in October 1984, I could not tolerate the situation any longer; I made up my mind to overturn all the things related to the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, this morning these things are still with us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My reason for mentioning this to you is to ask you to overturn these old things.</S>
