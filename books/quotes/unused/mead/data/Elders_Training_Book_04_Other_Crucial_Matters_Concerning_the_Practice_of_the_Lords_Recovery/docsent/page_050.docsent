   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE CHINESE-SPEAKING WORK THE IMMIGRATION FACTOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since 1983 we have felt led of the Lord to take care of the Chinese-speaking work in the United States and in Canada.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I first came to the United States, I had a clear feeling that I should not spend much time with the Chinese-speaking work in order to concentrate the work for the recovery among the English-speaking saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all have seen that this work was very much under the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1967, though, the United States immigration law was renewed, giving a quota of twenty thousand immigrants to the Chinese people yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that from 1967 until today, twenty thousand Chinese people have come to the United States every year.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By 1982, approximately three hundred thousand Chinese people had come to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Beginning in 1982, the United States government added another twenty thousand to the quota of Chinese immigrants.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was mainly due to the United States' relationship with Red China.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, from 1982 forty thousand Chinese immigrants have been coming to the United States every year.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some of these Chinese immigrants are students who are studying to attain a high degree.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many of these immigrants already have their master's degree or their Ph.D. and they all have a high rank in their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Other immigrants include the direct relatives of these college graduates such as parents, wives, brothers, or sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Still other immigrants are rich people who could afford to make some investment in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have considered that this situation is an answer of the Lord to the prayers of so many dear saints, including those good missionaries who went to China.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Their prayers for the great race of China are now being answered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>China was closed to the gospel for many, many years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So much prayer has been offered to the Lord by His faithful saints that today on this earth, the Chinese are easy to bring to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is especially true in the educational circles the universities, including the graduate schools.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is true not only in one country, but everywhere on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even the rich Chinese people are easy to bring to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have been observing the situation among the Chinesespeaking people since I came to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Immediately after the new immigration law was put into force in 1967, I noticed something among the Chinese-speaking citizens or residents in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, I still did not have a clear view that I would be spending some time to take care of this part of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then in 1980 a Chinese-speaking meeting was begun in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1983 I began to feel led of the Lord that we should not miss the chance to work on these Chinese students on their campuses and also on the Chinese community.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the present time in the United States, there are approximately one and a half million Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In California the total number of Chinese immigrants is approximately three hundred thousand, which is one-fifth of the total Chinese population in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Approximately one hundred and fifty thousand of these immigrants live around Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Also, a large number of these have settled in the Orange County, California area.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why there are many "Chinese churches" in the Southern California area.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>OUR COOPERATION IN THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Throughout the years, we have not done much work among the Chinese-speaking people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Due to this, we have lost a number of them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Among these Chinese immigrants over the years, a good number were saints who were among us in Taiwan and in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When they came to this country, they got scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we did not do much to take care of them, they were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the young ones among them, who were studying in the schools, became very prevailing factors among the scattered Chinese Christian groups.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must realize that nearly everywhere in the United States on the campuses there are Chinese students and Chinese Christian fellowships which are in the Chinese language.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Wherever there are a number of Chinese on a certain campus, there is a Chinese Christian fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In these fellowships many of the speaking ones and leading ones are products of the churches in Taiwan and of the church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means they went out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A few of these are dissenting, but most of them are still for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This situation led us to reconsider our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Beginning in 1983, we felt that we could not go on any further without paying adequate attention to this part of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Otherwise, we would suffer much.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Within the past year, we have had two Chinese-speaking conferences with about eleven hundred attendants for the first conference and twelve hundred to thirteen hundred attendants for the second conference.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Within one year's time, from 1983 to 1984, twenty-nine Chinese-speaking meetings have been raised up in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The number of people in these Chinese-speaking meetings is also increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A number of the churches can testify how the Lord has blessed this and how this has become a help to the church in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I feel that our cooperation with the Lord in this work is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of course, this is not a direct work with the English-speaking people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, I believe that since most of the young generation of these Chinese immigrants are graduates with master's degrees and Ph.D. degrees, when they get saved, gained by the Lord, and trained with the New Testament economy, the truth of the recovery will be channeled through them to the English-speaking people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The present situation among us is that the Chinese-speaking people, the community at large and the students, are very open to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Also, a number of Chinese Christian fellowships use our materials and have our books.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to follow the Lord's sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This situation is something sovereign of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This does not mean, however, that we are going to establish Chinese churches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that we are establishing the local churches with all races.</S>
