	 <h2 class="head4">The Outer Court</h2>
<p>Those living in the outer court contact the altar and the laver (Exo. 40:29-32). The altar was where offerings were offered to make expiation for the offerer (Lev. 1:4), and the laver was for washing the hands and feet. In type, this matches the experience of a newly saved one. Before a person is saved, in type he is outside the curtains of fine linen and has nothing to do with the tabernacle. Then one day he is convicted of sin and brings an ox or a lamb as a sin offering to present at the altar. Through the offerings, his problem of sin is dealt with. As a priest, he would then need to wash his hands and feet at the laver. This shows that a person begins to have a relationship with the church through expiation and cleansing. Through the experience of expiation for sin and the cleansing of the body, the barrier of sin between the believer and God is completely removed. This is the condition of someone in the outer court.</p>
<p>Although this condition depicts the condition of a newly saved one, there are many brothers and sisters who, despite having been saved for ten or twenty years, still remain in the outer court. When they testify of their experience, their testimony is related to the outer court, being related either to the altar or the laver, that is, concerning the washing away of their sins or concerning their being cleansed of earthly defilements. Their spiritual condition has not progressed beyond that of one who is newly saved.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Holy Place</h2>
<p>The spiritual condition of those in the Holy Place is deeper than that of those in the outer court. In the Holy Place there are three main items: the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar (Exo. 25:23-40; 30:1-6). Each of these three items refers to Christ Himself. The bread of the Presence signifies Christ as the bread of life, the lampstand signifies Christ as the light of life, and the incense altar signifies Christ as our acceptance before God. These three items show how Christ becomes our experience before God.</p>
<p>Those who are in the experience of the Holy Place are deeper and more advanced than those in the outer court. They know Christ as their bread of life, live in Christ as the light of life, and fellowship with God by relying on Christ as their acceptance before God. However, this is still not sufficient. Even though Christ has become their bread of life, light of life, and the means through which they fellowship with God, they spend most of the time in their soul. When they speak of certain matters, they are excited in their soul, sense the sweetness in their feeling, and enjoy testifying and talking to people regarding these matters. This kind of enjoyment and talk proves that their spiritual condition is related to the Holy Place.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Holy of Holies</h2>
<p>The Holy Place typifies the soul, but more specifically it refers to our person. In studying the type of the tabernacle, it is difficult to determine whether the outer court or the Holy Place signifies the outer man. Apparently, the outer court is outside, whereas the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies are on the inside. Nevertheless, according to the record in the Bible, the Holy Place denotes the outer man. Within the tabernacle there was a veil separating the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. Hebrews 10 tells us that the veil typifies the flesh that the Lord Jesus put on in His incarnation (v. 20). This flesh also signifies our person. Hence, in actuality, man, not God, is in the Holy Place.</p>
<p>From one perspective, the Holy Place is located inside the outer court, but from another perspective, the Holy Place is outside the veil. The book of Hebrews does not exhort us to enter the Holy Place but to enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, within the veil (v. 19). To enter within the veil means to enter into God. To leave the Holy Place and enter into the Holy of Holies is to leave man and enter into God. It is true that the bread of the Presence typifies Christ as the bread of life, the lampstand typifies Christ as the light of life, and the incense altar typifies Christ as the acceptance between God and man; however, none of these items typify Christ Himself. Only the Ark, which is in the Holy of Holies, typifies Christ Himself.</p>
<p>The Holy of Holies is the place where God dwelt, because only the Ark in the Holy of Holies typifies Christ Himself. In the Holy Place there was food, light, and God&rsquo;s acceptance, all of which are related to Christ. Christ is able to have an effect on our soul, causing us to be filled and joyful, and enabling us to sense God&rsquo;s acceptance. These are experiences related to the soul. Although Christ is the source of these experiences, He does not dwell in our soul. In the Holy Place, in our soul, Christ can fill us, enlighten us, and cause us to have a sense of harmony, comfort, and acceptance by God; nevertheless, Christ does not dwell in our soul. He is not outside the veil but within the veil.</p>
<p>Some saints may testify regarding how they are filled and enlightened by the Lord. They testify that they are full of joy and have sweet fellowship with the Lord. Such testimonies indicate that these brothers and sisters have entered into the Holy Place. It may seem that they are Christians with some depth of experience, but actually they are still outside the Holy of Holies and have not entered within the veil.</p>
<p>Another saint may testify that he was the topmost sinner but that the Lord Jesus died for him and released him from the burden of his sins. Now that Christ has delivered and released him from bondage, he feels that he must abandon all sinful matters and serve the Lord. From his testimony, we know that he is in the outer court, at the altar and the laver, offering oxen and lambs and washing his hands and feet. He is a Christian in the outer court.</p>
<p>Half a year later, this saint may testify of his sweet fellowship with the Lord and that he is satisfied, enlightened, and inwardly full of light. When he mentions these things, he is excited and has much to say. At this time, he has made progress and entered into the Holy Place. Formerly, he knew only that the Lord Jesus died for him and bore his sins, but now he knows that the Lord is in him as his food and light, enabling him to fellowship with God. Although he may seem to be a Christian who lives within the veil, he has not actually entered within the veil and is still outside of the Holy of Holies. If he is faithful to the Lord, the Holy Spirit will show him that he is still in the process and has not yet reached the destination. He will see that he needs to go deeper, to enter within the veil, that is, into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>There are some in the church who truly live within the Holy of Holies. Their experience is much deeper than those in the Holy Place. They truly live in their inner man. They not only sense the presence of Christ inwardly but have entered the Holy of Holies. Christ does not merely influence them outwardly; they touch Him in their innermost part. This is what it means to enter into the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar are not visible. The bread of the Presence has become the hidden manna within the Ark, the lampstand has become the tablets of the covenant within the Ark, and the incense altar has become the budding rod within the Ark. In the Holy of Holies everything is hidden within the Ark (Heb. 9:3-4).</p>
<p>The Ark typifies Christ Himself. When a person has entered into the depths, he may not speak much and has little excitement or even utterance in his prayer, but one can sense something solid within him. His condition is entirely different from one that is related to being in the Holy Place. A person who lives in the Holy Place prays much, and the sound of his prayer is like the fragrance of the incense altar in the Holy Place. Moreover, he can spend most of his time burning the incense with prayer. A person in the Holy of Holies, however, does not have much excitement, prayer, or outward testimony; nevertheless, when we contact him, we sense that there is a treasure in him, that something great is hidden within him. Although he does not shine forth much light outwardly, something hidden in him is very solid. Everything in the Holy Place is manifested, but everything in the Holy of Holies is hidden. Those who are in the Holy of Holies are not as excited as those in the Holy Place. However, something within them is very solid.</p>
<p>There are a number of people within the church who live in the Holy of Holies. They are weighty people. Their weightiness does not come from rank but from the measure of their spiritual experience and progress. If we apply rank in the church, the church will become Judaistic. In a Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, all the saints come with the same position; we are all priests. However, as soon as a certain saint opens his mouth to pray and praise the Lord, others know whether he is living in the outer court or in the Holy Place. The thanks and praises he renders are related to the Lord&rsquo;s table, but they are also related to the altar. When we hear the thanks and praises of the saints at the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, we should be able to sense the difference in their spiritual progress. Some people do not say much. Their voice is neither high nor loud, and they do not sound excited. Nevertheless, once they open their mouths, we sense that they are in the Holy of Holies. We are able to touch heaven and God through them.</p>
<p>Last November a brother from England came to visit us. In the first few days of these so-called revival meetings, some brothers were very excited when they prayed. It seemed that the roof of the meeting hall was almost lifted off. At that time, many brothers and sisters seemed to touch the presence of Christ and Christ as life, and as a result, they were excited. However, the more I heard their prayers and testimonies, the more my inner being sensed that they were in the Holy Place. Not only were they soulish, but their souls were released.</p>
<p>In the church there are definite differences in the degree of spirituality. According to typology the majority of believers are in the outer court, a few are in the Holy Place, and an even smaller number are in the Holy of Holies. This picture is very fitting. In the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting we often see people coming with lambs and oxen, hustling and bustling to offer sacrifices. This is the condition of those in the outer court.</p>
<p>When it comes to the prayer meeting, there is a little flavor of the Holy Place. Even though the number of people is smaller, the prayer meeting is deeper than the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning message meeting. At the time of prayer, sometimes we are even able to touch Christ directly, touching something deeper in certain saints. This is to be in the Holy of Holies. Hence, in the church there are three levels of spiritual experience among the believers.</p>
