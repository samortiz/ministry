   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Not Lusting for a Woman by Looking at Her and Committing Adultery in the Heart Surpassing Not Committing Adultery</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 5:27 and 28 say, "You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But I say to you, that every one who looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The old law, the commandment not to commit adultery Exo 20:14; Deut 5:18 , is in verse 27.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The new complementing law regarding adultery is in verse 28.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The law of the old dispensation deals with the outward act of adultery, whereas the new law of the kingdom deals with the inward motive of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew 5:21-22 the Lord Jesus speaks about anger, and in 5:27-28, about lust.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our temper and our lust constantly damage us and trouble us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to live up to a moral standard higher than that of the old law, we must overcome our temper and our lust.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to do this, we need Christ, and we need another life the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How we need to stay with Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must contact Him not only day by day but even hour by hour.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of the anger and lust within us, we need to remain in constant fellowship with the Lord, continually experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we shall experience and enjoy the divine life, a life that can fulfill the highest standard and that overcomes our anger and lust.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to be very clear concerning the fact that actually we are not keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, we are walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 8:4 tells us that when we walk according to the spirit, we spontaneously fulfill all the righteous requirements of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are not trying to keep the law, for the more we try to keep it, the more we break it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is fully revealed and recorded in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we are neither under the law nor obliged to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are free from the law, and now we are walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Within the spirit there is Christ, who is our resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we walk according to the spirit, we fulfill the requirements of even the highest law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we do not need to keep the law in the sense of striving in ourselves, but we must walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we walk according to the spirit, we spontaneously fulfill all the requirements of the law, overcoming our anger and our lust, and have the highest standard of morality. c Not Having Divorce Surpassing Putting Away the Wife with a Paper of Divorce</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matthew 5:31 and 32 say, "It was said: Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But I say to you that every one who puts away his wife, except in a case of fornication, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries one that has been put away commits adultery."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What the Lord Jesus decreed in 5:21-30 as the new law of the kingdom complements the law of the old dispensation, whereas what He proclaimed in 5:31-48 as the new law of the kingdom changes the law of the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the old law, a man could divorce his wife simply by giving her a writing of divorcement.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law of the old dispensation concerning divorce was ordained because of the people's hardness of heart; it was not according to God's design in the beginning Matt 19:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord's new decree recovers marriage back to the beginning designed by God Matt 19:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The marriage tie can be broken only by death Rom 7:3 or fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, to have a divorce for any other reason is to commit adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In His original design for marriage, God ordained one wife for one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But due to the weakness and hardness of heart of the children of Israel, when the law was given, Moses gave a man permission to divorce his wife with a writing of divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in Matthew 5:31-32 this law regarding divorce is changed, and the matter of marriage is recovered to God's intention at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now only two things can break the marriage tie: the death of one of the parties or adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, not having divorce surpasses putting away the wife with a paper of divorce.</S>
