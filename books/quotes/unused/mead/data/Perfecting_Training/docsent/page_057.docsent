   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ABIDING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During the years of 1932, 1933, and 1934 I was seeking to abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By reading the Scriptures I realized that John 15 was a most crucial chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abide in Me and I in you John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I even gave message after message telling people that all other teachings were not necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They only needed to do one thing, that is, to abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I spent as much money as I could afford to buy books concerning abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For nearly three years almost every day I was commanding the Lord, Lord, help me to abide in You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the more I told the Lord to help me, the more the Lord didn t do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe all of you who have sought the Lord in that way can also testify that kind of seeking didn t work and that kind of prayer didn t work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It took me a long time to realize this didn t work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Finally, after a certain period of time, I didn t give the Lord the commandment to help me to abide in Him, but I lived a life spontaneously abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose a branch on a tree knows that it has to abide in the tree and let the tree abide in it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more this branch would practice abiding, the more the branch would be off.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The real abiding is a natural thing; it is not a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But for us today to get into the natural condition is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is hard even for me to speak such a message to you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>TRYING TO BE ABSOLUTE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that through these messages you could see something.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of you have checked whether or not you love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have realized that you love the Lord, but you may have considered that you do not love Him so absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes people without experience would say, Yes, you love the Lord, but not absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then you go back home and try to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I did these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, I began to question how absolute is absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some people and even some books would say you are still not absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One even gave an illustration that if on the balance you need a hundred ounces to balance and you only have ninety-nine, you are short until you put on another ounce.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But in our experience if we put on another ounce of absoluteness still it is ninety-nine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Regardless of how many additional ounces of absoluteness I put in, always it is still ninety-nine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So I discovered it is a kind of nonsense to talk about absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How absolute is absolute?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am not a sloppy person, and I really tried to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more I added another ounce of absoluteness, the shorter I was of ninety-nine ounces.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That was a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By trying to be more absolute you get nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I know that you have all practiced to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I don t blame you, because I passed through this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You, too, have to pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You tell others that they need to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You tell others that three years ago we had a cause, and we were so absolute, but now we are not so absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to your sensation you were more absolute three years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, you are more absolute today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But I have not said a word because you have to pass this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I would be foolish to tell you not to pass this stage because you would stop and not go on.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thank the Lord that you have come here to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now you may look back and see that your teachings on absoluteness mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You just need to love the Lord, to seek the Lord, and to stay with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Tell the Lord that you love Him, that you want everything of Him, but that you would not do anything, that the Lord must do it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Tell Him that you love to be one spirit with Him, but that you wouldn t do it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But don t imitate.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Imitating doesn t work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is altogether a matter of growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>ACCORDING TO THE GROWTH OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do believe that now is the time at least some of you have come to the stage where you need this help.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This help will be a rest to you and a release to you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Eventually, from morning to evening, you will just enjoy the Lord living Himself out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Day by day you will not be saving yourself, but you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some of you may say you understand now what I mean, and that you will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you would do it, that is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Don t try not to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you try not to do it, you are performing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Recently, my daughter and her two sons came to visit me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The first is a little over three years of age, and the second is close to two years.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The first one has grown up to a stage that he spoke the best Chinese to me, with the best tone and the proper pronunciation, and the grammar was altogether right.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The second one just followed the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The first one said, Come to my home, and the second one could just say, My home.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You have to realize regardless of how much you endeavor, if your growth is like the first one you will speak a complete sentence: Come to my home and play with me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you don t have much growth you may simply say, Home, play.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How you respond to these Perfecting Messages will be according to your growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the church life we do not have classes or grades.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have only one general grade which includes everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we give a message, some needs will surely be met.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some needs will not be met today, but after six months you would remember what you heard, and you would receive the help.</S>
