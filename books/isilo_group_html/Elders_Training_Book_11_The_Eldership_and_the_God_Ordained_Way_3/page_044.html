In this chapter we want to fellowship concerning the second step of the God-ordained way. The second step is the feeding of the lambs, the new believers (John 21:15). Some may feel that this is an old subject, but I want to fellowship about this matter in a newer way. My thought concerning the way to meet and to serve has been revolutionized. All of us need to be revolutionized in our thinking with the God-ordained way of meeting and serving for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE UNIQUE NEED<br>FOR PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY&#151;<br>VISITING PEOPLE REGULARLY</H2><P>For gospel preaching, for feeding the lambs, and for perfecting the saints&#151;the first three steps of the God-ordained way&#151;the very unique need is to visit people. To visit people is to go to them and stay with them. You have to speak with them face to face. If you were to visit someone every week for ten minutes, you could surely gain that person in a year. The biblical way for us to gain people is to visit them, to spend time with them face to face.</P><P>I hope that you will take my advice. Try to select three persons of your choice, and go to them once a week. Do not put them together to have a small meeting. You may visit the first one on Monday, the second one on Wednesday, and the third one on Saturday. Go to them separately. Just go to visit them and see them one by one every week, spending ten minutes with each of them. You do not need to speak too much. Try to do this for half a year. I assure you that they will be gained by you. They will even follow you to practice the God-ordained way.</P><P>In addition to bringing this God-ordained way to all the churches, we are burdened for the release of the truth. This is why we are looking to the Lord to complete our Life-study of the books of the Old Testament. The practice of the church life, however, must match this study of the Word. In my present training of the elders, I do not want to pass on more teachings. I must stress one thing&#151;the elders have to contact people. You should endeavor to contact three people daily or about twenty people a week. When you contact these people, there is no need for you to talk too much. Just go to see them.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 11: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (3) &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
