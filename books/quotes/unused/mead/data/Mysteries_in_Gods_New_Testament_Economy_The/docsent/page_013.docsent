   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ADDITIONAL WORD 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While I was listening to your pray-reading this morning, I had a feeling within me.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We began to practice pray-reading in 1966.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By now it has been twenty-four years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This does not mean that we have graduated already.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We still have to learn to pray-read better.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In our pray-reading, we did not have an adequate digestion of the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In particular, the rich flavor that is in the Lord's word did not come out through our praying and digestion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Pray-reading is like eating; one cannot do it hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is especially true with rich meals.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to eat slowly before we can sense the taste and assimilate the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to learn to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>RAISING THE LEVEL OF SPIRITUALITY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You who are sitting here can be considered as the cream of the Lord's recovery in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would take this opportunity to fellowship with you a word from my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to my observation, during the past few decades, we seem to have stopped advancing in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our spiritual level has not progressed that much.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seems that we are still at the elementary school age.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We know some basic truths.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But concerning matters such as the mysterious revelations in God's New Testament economy, we still do not know that much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the past forty years, although I have borne the responsibility in the release of the truth, there are few among us who can be considered as university graduates spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this I feel indebted to you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This time I came with an intention to fellowship this matter with you clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At least I should tell you honestly that we are not up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to have the self-realization that we are not up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not talk about the right and wrong things anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are not worth our mentioning at all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is worth mentioning is our knowledge concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to realize that at least fifty percent of our work in the church is in education.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If this aspect is conducted poorly, we come short and have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, from now on, we must strive and pursue toward this point.</S>
