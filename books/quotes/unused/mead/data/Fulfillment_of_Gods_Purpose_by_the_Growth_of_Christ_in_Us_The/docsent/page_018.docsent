   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD BEING RICH TO ALL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHO CALL UPON HIM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 10 also says that the Lord is "rich to all who call upon Him" v. 12 . It does not say that the Lord is rich to all who believe on Him, but to all who call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need the calling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In your home you need the calling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In your kitchen you need the calling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In your office you need the calling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the street you need the calling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you are weak, you need the calling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You can say, "O Lord Jesus, I am weak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you call in this way, you will become stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are going to lose your temper, do not try to restrain it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just call on the name of the Lord: "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This calling on the name of the Lord Jesus will be a kind of power, a kind of authority, and this will chase away all the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In any kind of situation, whether it is one of darkness or weakness, just call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By calling, "O Lord Jesus," you will enjoy the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is rich to all who call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved v. 13 . Now is the age for us to recover the practice of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>CALLED BY GOD TO CALL</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Corinthians 1:2 says that we are the called saints who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have been called to be the calling people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, we have been called.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, we have to be calling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are the called people to be the calling people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not merely believe on Him or pray to Him; we must call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God called us into the fellowship of Christ v. 9 . To us, the called ones, Christ is power and wisdom v. 24 , but how can we enjoy Christ as power and wisdom? It is by calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have been called to enjoy Christ v. 9 . If we want to enjoy Christ, we have to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to be the calling people who call on the Lord all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In some situations you may have the feeling that you are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The best way to chase away the darkness is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have to say, "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes you may feel depressed in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you call on the name of the Lord, you will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not a doctrine but something for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you do not take this and put it into practice, this fellowship will not mean anything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if you put this into practice, you will see that this is the way to breathe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To call on the name of the Lord is to breathe Him, and this includes drinking and eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The drinking and eating are included in the breathing, and breathing is by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is everything to us, and He has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and He has ascended to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He has been glorified and enthroned to reach the highest attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now He is the Spirit within us and the Word outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit within is the pneuma, the breath, and the Word without is also the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to take Him in, we need to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The best way, even the unique way, the only way, to breathe Him is to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just open up yourself all the time and call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then learn how to mingle prayer and the reading of the Word with your breathing, your calling.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You will have the deep sense that whenever you call on the name of the Lord by praying and reading the Word, you are breathing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this breathing, you have the drinking and eating.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All day long you will participate in Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ will be taken into you to become a part of you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You will then be in the rich enjoyment of Christ as life.</S>
