   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING 3 LEARNING, EXERCISING, AND PRACTICING 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:4; Heb 5:12-14; 2 Pet 3:18; 1 Pet 2:2-3; Eph 4:13-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to God's creation, our mouth has many purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our mouth is used for breathing, drinking, and eating, yet the ultimate use of our mouth is for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our speaking can be of three categories.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first category is prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second kind of speaking is that which is proper and upright.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The third kind of speaking is in the category of evil speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This includes gossiping, criticizing, reasoning, quarreling, and expressions of anger.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To prophesy is something from the heavens, to speak in a proper way is something on the earth, and to gossip is something from Gehenna Matt 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In today's society, most of the speaking is not from the earth but from Gehenna.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. LEARNING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Among us, there must be the first category of speaking, the category of speaking from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Prophesying is this kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To speak for God, to speak God forth, and to speak Christ into people, ministering the riches of Christ into another person's being, is the highest speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in order to prophesy, we must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every kind of speaking comes out of learning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Proper speaking requires proper learning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because prophesying is the highest speaking, we also need the highest learning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We cannot carry out the highest speaking without learning the highest language.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, in the training meetings I urge, charge, and encourage all the saints to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But on the other hand, I sympathize with the saints because I know that to prophesy is really not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Prophesying is the highest speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To gossip or to lose one's temper is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no need of preparation to gossip or lose one's temper.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But prophesying requires preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In society to be a very good speaker requires much learning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a person speaks, his educational level can be discerned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a person were thirty years of age and had only finished junior high school, his ability would be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is a difference between ability and capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Capacity is something by birth; but ability is something by birth plus learning, training, and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A. The Truths</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this message, I want to point out twenty-two major points of the truths which we need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Concerning the Person of God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first item we all must learn is the truth concerning the person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the most puzzling truth in the Bible.</S>
