<h2 class="head3">1. Laodicea Being the Result of<br />Philadelphia's Degradation</h2><p>This is where the issue lies today. Once Philadelphia fails, it becomes Laodicea. Do not think that Protestantism is Laodicea. It is altogether wrong to think this way. Protestantism is Sardis, not Laodicea. Protestantism can only be Sardis today; it cannot be Laodicea. No Bible reader should be so foolish as to think that Protestantism is Laodicea. No, Protestantism is Sardis. After Philadelphia has fallen, it becomes Laodicea. Sardis came out of Thyatira, and it was one step beyond Thyatira. Philadelphia came out of Sardis, and it was one step beyond Sardis. Laodicea, however, comes out of Philadelphia, but it is one step behind Philadelphia. These four churches will remain until the Lord Jesus comes again.</p><p>Laodicea is a distorted Philadelphia. When brotherly love is gone, Philadelphia immediately turns into the opinions of many. This is the meaning of the word Laodicea. Laodicea was a city whose name came from a Roman prince, Entiochus. He had a wife whose name was Laodios. He took his wife's name, dropped the os and added sea or cea to become Laodisea or Laodicea. Lao in Greek means "many people" and sea or cea means "opinion."</p><p>As soon as Philadelphia becomes degraded, the "brothers" become the "many people," and its "brotherly love" becomes "the opinions of the many." Love has degenerated into opinion. Brotherly love is something living, but the opinion of many people is something dead. When brotherly love is lost, the Body relationship is lost. The fellowship of life is cut off as well, leaving only the opinion of men. The opinion of the Lord is lost, and the only things left are the vote of the majority, ballots, and the show of hands. Once Philadelphia falls, it becomes Laodicea.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Lukewarmness and Spiritual Pride</h2><p>Revelation 3:15 says, "I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot." This is the characteristic of Laodicea. Verse 17 says, "Because you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked." These are the characteristics of Laodicea. In the eyes of the Lord, the characteristics of Laodicea are lukewarmness and spiritual pride. It is bad enough for it to say, "I am wealthy," but it continues, saying, "and have become rich." The two statements are evil enough, yet it goes on to say that it has "need of nothing." In the eyes of the Lord it is "wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked." Where does spiritual pride come from? It comes from history. Some were once rich and they think that they are still rich. The Lord was once merciful to them, and they remember their history. But now they have lost that reality.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Life That Was Present Being Lost Today</h2><p>There is hardly any person in Protestantism today who boasts of his own spiritual riches. I have met many Protestant leaders overseas as well as Protestant pastors in China. They all say, "We are poor! We are poor!" It is hard to find a proud person in Sardis. There is only one group of proud people&mdash;those who were Philadelphia and who had once kept God's word and not denied His name. Yet the life which they once had is lost. They still remember their history, but they have lost their former life! They remember that they were once wealthy and had become rich and had need of nothing. But they are now poor and blind! There is only one group of people who can boast of their riches&mdash;fallen Philadelphia, the Philadelphia which has lost its power and life.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Learning to Humble Ourselves before God</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, if you want to continue in the way of Philadelphia, remember to humble yourselves before God. Sometimes I hear some brothers say, "God's blessing is with us." God's blessing is with us, but we must be careful when we say this. As soon as we are not careful, we have the flavor of Laodicea: "We are wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing." Let me say that the day we take this position, we have become Laodicea.</p><p>Please bear in mind that we have nothing that we have not received. Those around us may be full of death, but we do not need to be conscious of the fact that we are full of life. Those around us may be poor, but we do not need to be conscious of the fact that we are rich. Those who live before the Lord will not be conscious of their own riches. May the Lord be merciful to us that we may learn to live before Him. May we be rich and yet not know that we are rich. It was better for Moses not to know that his face was shining, even though it did shine! Once a person knows himself, he becomes Laodicea, and the result is lukewarmness. Laodicea means to know everything, but in reality to be fervent about nothing. In name it has everything, but it cannot sacrifice its life for anything. It remembers its former glory but forgets its present condition before God. Formerly, it was Philadelphia; today it is Laodicea.</p>
