   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Creating a Thirst within Man for God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Tonight I have a word specifically for the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to know why God has put us in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has put us in the world so that our presence would create a hunger and thirst for righteousness in sinners, believers, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our work, we have to create a hunger within others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There must be an enigmatic freshness, power, nourishment, and supply within us that will drive others to seek after God by our presence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Others should have a desire to seek after God as a result of meeting us and speaking to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we always see others and communicate with them without creating a desire within them for God, it means that we have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If our reading of the Bible, prayer, service, and gospel preaching do not produce such a powerful hunger within man, our work has failed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many who know Miss Barber can testify that she was very different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever someone went to her and sat in front of her, spontaneously he would realize how much he was off.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He would realize that he did not have what she had and would aspire for what she had.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fifteen years ago 1921 when I first became a Christian, I was very proud.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I thought highly of myself because I was able to read one or two chapters of the Bible a day with some understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Very few people are proud outwardly; most people are proud inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I went to her to tell her about this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After I prayed a few words with her, I saw my pride before she even opened her mouth to rebuke me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I knew that I did not have what she had.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My feet were washed by her presence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I met God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Prior to that I was living outside of God, and I was old and dark.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But once I came to her, I was refreshed and enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I often felt that I was washed by her presence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We often have the same sensation we feel that we are washed after talking to certain brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our spiritual energy is revived; we can touch and feel God once more.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A few days ago, I felt that my feet were defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At first I thought that I had sinned, and I proceeded to deal with my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But God was still very far from me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I felt that there was a separation between myself and God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I could do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While I was praying I was secretly saying to myself, "You are just composing your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not something from your heart."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later, I saw a sister who had been saved for only two or three months.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She told me of her salvation experience and told me how she was persecuted by her family.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She hoped that I would give her some help.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I heard this, I said, "Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I came, my feet were defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when I leave, my feet will be clean because your testimony has washed away the oldness in my experiences."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The book of Titus mentions the renewing of the Spirit 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a very precious expression.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need the renewing of the Spirit so that we can always be spiritually fresh and invigorated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A bronze flower vase needs constant polishing to make it shine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there is no polishing, there may not be any rust, but there will be a coating of dust and the vase will not shine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The same is true with us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may not be sinful, but we may have a coating of dust that prevents us from shining.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord said to Peter, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me" John 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Having no part with the Lord does not mean perdition; it means having no part in the fresh fellowship of the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If our feet are not washed, there will be a separation between us and the Lord, and we will not be able to enjoy the freshness of His life and the freshness of His supply.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the meaning of having no part in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord wants to wash our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore we must be willing to be washed and renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Aspiring to Wash Others' Feet</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the same time, we have to aspire to wash others' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we cannot wash others' feet unless we have the overcoming life and the Spirit's help to live out such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some can wash others' feet, while others cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You may live with some for over a year and yet still not have your feet washed once.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Washing requires that we live an overcoming life before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to be fresh all the time before we can wash others' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Who are the ones who need washing, and who are the ones who have to wash others' feet?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord said, "You also ought to wash one another's feet" John 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This tells us that we all need the washing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who were spiritually fresh but who have lost their freshness need the washing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every one of us needs our feet washed, and every one of us needs to be prepared to wash others' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord said, "If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Among all the services that Christians minister to one another, nothing is more crucial or more precious than foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them" v. 17 . I love what Brother Yu has said many times: "The Bible today is more precious than the Bible yesterday." May we have fresh spiritual experiences every day.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Romans 15:32 says, "I may refresh myself and rest with you."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the result of foot-washing.</S>
