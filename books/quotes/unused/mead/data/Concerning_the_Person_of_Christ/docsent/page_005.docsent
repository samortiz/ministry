   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REVELATION OF THE SCRIPTURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the Person of Christ is a great mystery, the Bible speaks very clearly regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This matter which is revealed in the Scripture is a mystery, but the words which the Bible uses in unveiling it are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, though we cannot completely understand such a mystery, we can comprehend and receive the words which the Bible speaks concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ Is God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both in the Old and New Testaments, the Bible many times and in many ways clearly says that Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. In the Old Testament</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hebrews 1:5 tells us that the word spoken by God in 2 Samuel 7:14, I will be his father, and he shall be my son, refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is His Father, and He is God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such a designation, according to the biblical sense, shows equality with God John 5:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Beginning with Genesis, there are many places in the Old Testament which speak concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, it is not until here in 2 Samuel 7 that it says God is His Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is God's Son, has the Godhead, and is equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He came as the Son of God with the Godhead to be the Christ of God to accomplish God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout the Psalms, Christ is repeatedly referred to as God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Psalm 2:7 says, The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word refers to God raising the Lord Jesus from the dead Acts 13:33 and declaring Him to be the Son of God who possesses the divine essence of the Godhead Rom 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although He became the Son of Man, and put on human nature and a human body, God raised Him up from the dead, declaring Him to be the Son of God, who has the divinity and the Godhead, being so much better than the angels Heb 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a Psalm praising Christ the Psalmist declares, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre Psa 45:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, O God in this verse is directed to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Psalmist plainly addressed Him as God and praised Him as such.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is not only the fairest One among the children of men v. 2 , but also God who has the throne forever and the scepter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He who is the fairest Man is simply God, the very God who reigns on the throne in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Psalm 102 the Psalmist declares, O my God thy years are throughout all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of old hadst thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end Psa 102:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a word of praise to God, saying that God is both the Creator and Ruler of the heavens and earth, and that He is ever unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Hebrews 1:8-12 this word speaks of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here again, the Bible clearly says that Christ is God, and praises Him as the Lord who creates and rules the heavens and earth, who is the same, and whose years shall have no end.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>David declared, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand Psa 110:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Matthew 22:42-45, the Lord pointed out that here David called Him Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This proves that He is God; otherwise, how could David call Him Lord since according to the flesh He is the Son of David?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although He became flesh and was made the Son of David, as God He is David's Lord, the One who sits in heaven and is equal with God.</S>
