<h2 class="head3">3. Man's Fall and Rebellion</h2><p>Though only two persons rebelled in this catastrophe, it was in effect a rebellion of the whole world. Not only was the authority of man over man overthrown, but even the authority of God over man was overthrown. Satan said that in the day they ate thereof, they would be as God, and that God had forbidden them to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so that they would not become as Him. There were two rebellions: One was man's rebellion against God's appointed authority among men. The other was man's rebellion against God's own authority. In other words, God's direct authority was overturned, and His deputy authority was overturned as well. Man did not submit to God. He thought he could become God by doing what he did. God's authority was overthrown in this way. Man wanted to be God himself; he wanted to overthrow God's authority.</p><p>Eve should have submitted to Adam. She should have consulted with Adam about everything, but she did not check with him. Instead, she considered and made the decision. She took the lead to sin. Please bear in mind that independence in thought is the first step toward sin. If a man refuses to learn from God's appointed deputy authority and if he never presents things to God but cultivates his own independent thought, considering only what is pleasant to the eyes, what is good for food, and what is desirous to make one wise, he is rebelling not only against God but also against His appointed authority on the earth. The single act of transgression in the garden of Eden overthrew two authorities at the same time: God's deputy authority and His direct authority.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Man Following Satan to Live in Disobedience</h2><p>The story in the garden of Eden was a repetition of Satan's history. Satan wanted to uplift himself to be equal with God. He also tempted man to uplift himself to be equal with God. In the first paradise, the bright cherub rebelled. In the second paradise, man rebelled. Since that day man has been walking in the way of disobedience. Romans 5 says that through one offense, condemnation came to all men (v. 18), and through the disobedience of one man, the many were constituted sinners (v. 19). Please bear in mind that in God's eyes, what happened in the garden of Eden was not only an offense but an act of disobedience. Do not think that there was only sin in the garden of Eden; there was disobedience as well. Sin entered the world through the disobedience of one man. Since that day, man has been living under the principle of disobedience.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Rebellion of Mankind after the Flood</h2><h2 class="head3">1. God's Arrangement for Human Government<br />after the Flood</h2><p>At the time of the flood, God appointed men to be rulers. This was the beginning of human government. From the time of Adam to the time of the flood, there were families, not government. Government was instituted 1,656 years after the creation. After the emergence of government, we find authority resting not only with the family but also with government. "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed" (Gen. 9:6). This was the beginning of government.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Rebellion of the Nations</h2><p>After the flood, Ham rebelled against his father's authority (Gen. 9:20-27). Then God established the nations. But the people of the nations united together and built the tower of Babel for themselves. Though they did not rebel against each other, they united to rebel against God. In the garden the individual and the family rebelled against God. But at the tower of Babel, the nations rebelled against Him. Man's intention was to build a tower to go to heaven and to climb to the top to stand in God's place. God prepared stones on earth. But man prepared bricks as a counterfeit of God's stones. Mankind prepared bricks and built a tower for itself. Man tried to be like God. After the flood, the nations united to rebel against God.</p>
