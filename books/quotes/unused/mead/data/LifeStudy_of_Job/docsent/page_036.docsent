   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The regenerated ones, who are divinely human and humanly divine, spontaneously become an organism, the Body of Christ, which is the church of God as the new man in God's new creation to carry out God's new "career," that is, to build up the Body of Christ for the fullness, the expression, of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This fullness as the organism of the Triune God will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible begins with God in His creation as the initiation and ends with the New Jerusalem, which is the mingling of the Triune God and all His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Jerusalem is thus a constitution of God with man to express God for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To see this is to have an overview of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our reading of the Bible, we need to focus our attention on God's eternal economy for the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Unless we know God's economy we will not understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is not only the center of the Bible but also the centrality and universality of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was in this economy that Christ became incarnated, that He went to the cross to pass through crucifixion, that He came out from death and entered into resurrection, and that in resurrection He was begotten of God to be God's firstborn Son and as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit to regenerate all His believers to make them the same as He is in life and nature that they might become His brothers and the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These sons plus the Firstborn all become a new man, with Him as the Head and with the church as His Body, to carry out God's eternal purpose to consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we see this revelation concerning God's economy, then we will be able to understand the book of Job Job suffered God's stripping and consuming, but he did not understand what was happening to him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Job could say, "You have hidden these things in Your heart;/I know that this is with You" 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He knew that God had a purpose, but he did not know what God's purpose was.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Job and his three friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, were in the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even though Job was on a somewhat higher level than his friends, he and they were still in the same realm.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God was trying to rescue them from that realm and put them into the realm of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first thing God had to do was to strip Job, consume him, and tear him down so that he would become nothing as a person under suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This became the base for God to rebuild Job with the Divine Trinity, that Job could be a new man, a part of God's new creation, to fulfill God's eternal economy for God's expression.</S>
