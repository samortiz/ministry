   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR HELPING NEW BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO HAVE THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will consider the first item to shepherd a new believer into immediately after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to help every new believer to have the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After a person is genuinely saved by believing in the Lord and calling on His name, we should not rejoice and walk away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This can be compared to wrapping a package with rope without tying a knot.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After two or three days, the rope will loosen and the packaging will fall off.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to tie a tight and secure knot for someone who is newly saved, we need to help him have the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can also use the example of purchasing a house.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After purchasing a house, you must be sure that you have a legal document, the title deed, in your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The title deed is the evidence of possession.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You know that you own the house and the land because you have the title deed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The assurance of salvation is the title deed to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After leading a person to salvation, we must immediately help him to obtain the title deed to his salvation, that is, the sure proof of his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This proof, or title deed, is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION The Outward Proof</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>the Word of God 1 John 5:13</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us consider some appropriate verses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A brother said that Ephesians 1:13 is a good verse: In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although this is a word of assurance, this verse should not be used too early when speaking to new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Others have suggested Ephesians 2:8: By grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God ; Acts 16:31: Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household ; and John 3:16: God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These verses are words of assurance, but they are not the most appropriate, effective, and explicit statements regarding the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 10:28-29 says, I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two verses do not speak of the assurance of salvation but of the security of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to these verses, there are two hands the hand of the Lord and the hand of the Father holding us; hence, our salvation is secure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hebrews 1:3 says that the Lord upholds and bears all things by the word of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s hand upholds the earth, and this same hand upholds all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, every saved one is secure in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The best verse to use for the proof, the title deed, of salvation is 1 John 5:13, which says, I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The phrase these things refers to what is written in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>An example is verse 12, which says, He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After reading verse 12 with a new believer, we can ask whether he has the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He might say that he does not know.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At which point we should read both verses 12 and 13 to him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we should tell him that he has believed in the Lord and called on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord s name is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since he has called on the Lord and is saved, he has the Lord, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can ask him again whether he has the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After listening to what we say, he will know that he has the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we should read verse 12 with him again and ask him whether he has the life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He might answer that he does not feel that he has it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should tell him that it is not a matter of feeling but of fact.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Using the purchase of a house as an example, we can say that after a person receives the title deed for a house, that house is his regardless of whether he feels it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It does not matter how he feels.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What matters is that he has the title deed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the title deed of a house there are official statements that are approved by government agencies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These statements prove the ownership of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Bible there are many such official statements.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can read these statements to a new believer and tell him that these words are written for us so that we may know that we have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One official statement is Romans 10:13, which says, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Another is John 1:12: As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can tell him that by these words he knows that he has the life of God, and he also has the authority to become a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, God s word is the greatest proof that we have for the assurance of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are many words concerning the assurance of our salvation in chapters 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the Gospel of John as well as in Paul s Epistles.</S>
