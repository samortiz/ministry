   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BECOMING AS OUR TEACHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 6:40 the Lord continues, A disciple is not above his teacher; but everyone who has been perfected will be as his teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The teacher here is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we, the disciples, are perfected, we shall be as our teacher, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TAKING THE LOG OUT OF OUR OWN EYE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 6:41 and 42 the Lord says, And why do you look at the speck in your brother s eye, but the log in your own eye you do not consider?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can you say to your brother, Brother, allow me to take out the speck in your eye, not seeing the log that is in your own eye?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hypocrite, first take the log out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck in your brother s eye.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As children of God living in a humble spirit, we should first take the log out of our own eye whenever we look at the speck in our brother s eye.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The speck in our brother s eye should remind us of the log in our own eye.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As long as the log remains in our eye, our sight is blurred, and we shall not see clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>FURTHER WORDS OF WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 6:43 and 44 the Lord says, For there is no good tree producing rotten fruit, nor again a rotten tree producing good fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For each tree is known by its own fruit; for they do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a thornbush.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This word also is quite simple, but it indicates that the Man-Savior was full of divine wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord s sayings concerning the blind guiding the blind, the speck in our brother s eye and the log in our own eye, and each tree being known by its own fruit express His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 45 the Lord says that the good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of the heart brings forth what is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the Lord explains that the mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Following this, the Lord asks, And why do you call Me, Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say? v. 46 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>DOING THE LORD S WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 6:47-49 the Lord Jesus says, Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and does them, I will show you whom he is like.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when a flood came, the river broke against that house and was not strong enough to shake it, because it was well built.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But he who hears and does not do is like a man building a house upon the earth without a foundation, against which the river broke, and immediately it collapsed; and the crash of that house was great.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here the house refers both to our being and to our work, our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If our being is according to the Lord s word, it will have a proper foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, if our work is based on the Lord s word, it will have a solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If our being and our work are based upon the Lord s word, they will be able to withstand any kind of test, any flood or river.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if our being and our work are not founded on the Lord s word, the river will carry them away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The rock in 6:48 does not refer to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, it refers to the Lord s wise word, the word that reveals the will of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our being and work must be founded on the word of the Man-Savior for the accomplishment of the will of our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The house that is built on the rock and that is not shaken by the river is like the building work of gold, silver, and precious stones, which can stand the testing fire 1 Cor 3:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the house built upon the earth without a foundation and that collapses when the river breaks against it is like the building work of wood, hay, and stubble, which will be burned by the testing fire.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the builder himself will be saved 1 Cor 3:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A CLEAR VIEW OF</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF MORALITY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord s teaching in 6:17-49 gives us a clear view of the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As one who has studied the writings of Confucius, I can say that the teachings of Confucius do not present such a standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The topmost teaching on morality is that of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He Himself as the God-man lived a life that is the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His life, work, and saving power are all in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord conveyed His saving grace in His human virtues with His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the highest standard of morality, and we all need to pay careful attention to it.</S>
