<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. PEOPLE OF THE FLESH PERSECUTING<br>THOSE OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Galatians 4:29 says, "But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now." The children according to the flesh, like Ishmael, persecuted the children according to the Spirit, like Isaac. Paul said that now it is also the same. The people of the flesh always persecute those of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. NOTHING GOOD DWELLING IN THE FLESH</H2><P>In Romans 7:18a Paul said, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells." We should not say that we have something good in our flesh. We may think that we have bad flesh and good flesh, but there is no such thing as "good flesh." Nothing good dwells in our flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE FLESH BEING ENMITY AGAINST GOD</H2><P>Romans 8:7a says that the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God. This is because the flesh itself is enmity against God. When the mind is set on the flesh, it also becomes enmity against God. We have to develop this point when we share it with the saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE FLESH NOT BEING SUBJECT<br>TO THE LAW OF GOD</H2><P>Romans 8:7b says that the flesh is not subject to the law of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE FLESH BEING UNABLE<br>TO SUBJECT ITSELF TO THE LAW OF GOD</H2><P>Romans 8:7c goes on to say that the flesh is unable to subject itself to the law of God. Even if it wanted to be subject to the law, it would be unable to do so. Romans 8:7 is the strongest verse in the Bible describing the flesh. The flesh is enmity against God, the flesh is not subject to God's law, and the flesh is not able to subject itself to God's law. It does not have the ability. To expect the flesh to keep the law of God is like expecting a cat to fly. Paul was very strong to say that we should not expect that our flesh can keep the law or can subject itself to the law. It does not have the ability.</P>
