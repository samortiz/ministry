The strange thing is that we may never have heard a message in Christianity telling us that the Bible speaks about eating
After God created man, He put man in a garden, and He placed man before the tree of life, telling him in effect, 'Eat!
Brothers and sisters, this word is clearly in the Bible, yet we did not see it even after reading the Bible many times
Honestly speaking, even without Joshua 24, according to your mentality you would always say, 'I and my household will serve Jehovah'
One day when you come to Ephesians 5 concerning wives submitting to their husbands and husbands loving their wives you are quick to see this
If we want to know the proper relationship between God and man, we have to see what God wanted man to do after He created him
After Adam was created, God placed him in front of the tree of life and told him to freely eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden
After being poisoned, man died; after his death, he was placed in a coffin; after being placed in a coffin, he remained in Egypt
When many Christians and non-Christians talk about Christ, they expect that Christ will either till the ground or be shorn
Whenever fundamental Christianity speaks about the Feast of Passover, the blood of the lamb is invariably regarded with utmost importance
Many in Christianity speak clearly about the blood, but the focus of the Passover lamb is not on the blood but on the flesh
In the book of Deuteronomy, you see all kinds of produce as different kinds of offerings for the people of Israel to bring before God
Finally, at the end of Revelation you see the New Jerusalem with a river of water and the tree of life growing on both sides of the river
God ordained even before the foundation of the world that our destiny, our future, would be to daily eat the Lord
Recently when the church in Los Angeles has met, the chairs were not neatly arranged in single rows but rather in many small circles
When the brothers and sisters come together and occupy the benches row by row, it looks like a 'Sunday worship service'
To have small round tables here, each with five or six chairs, and to sit around them gives the atmosphere of feasting
The concepts and points of emphasis in the Bible are often beyond what we can think and are even contrary to our natural concepts
If you examine them closely, you will discover that most of them are concepts that already existed in your mind
We can almost say that you cannot get any concept out of your reading of the Bible unless that concept was already there in your mind
Their outward shape and color are not something only external; they are the growth and expression of the life within the flowers
Matthew 15 speaks about the Lord leaving the land of Judea and withdrawing to the Gentile region of Tyre and Sidon
Although she was a Gentile woman, she addressed the Lord Jesus as the Son of David according to the traditional concept of Judaism
You would dare not declare that you are greater because of the influence of the traditional concepts in religion
When the Lord Jesus withdrew to Tyre and Sidon, there appeared a Canaanite woman who was pitiful, lowly, and base
On that day the Holy Spirit worked in the Canaanite woman so that her understanding was opened immediately after hearing the Lord's word
Since the creation of man, God has always revealed Himself to man and placed Himself before man as the tree of life
If the fruit trees were several hundred feet high with fruit hanging from them, at such a height how could we get the fruit to eat?
Some Bible scholars suggest that the tree of life is a grapevine because the Lord Jesus once declared, 'I am the true vine'
Hallelujah, when God appeared to man the first time, He did not appear as a great One but rather as a tree placed before man!
If you dare not praise the Lord in this manner, it proves that you are still being influenced by your religious concepts
By this we understand that we do not need the Lord Jesus to do anything for us; instead, we need to eat the Lord Jesus
The more you pray, the less effective your prayers are; the more you pray, the more disobedient your children are
Do not ask the Lord to help you take good care of the churches; you have to turn to take a few bites of the Lord Jesus
It is wrong to ask the Lord to till the ground for you like an ox; it is also wrong to shear the Lord of wool for your beauty
When the wives eat Jesus, the husbands change for the better; when the husbands eat Jesus, the wives change for the better
You need to take the Lord Jesus into you and let Him become your life, your food, and your everything; then your circumstances will change
When the prodigal son returned home, outwardly he was clothed with the best robe prepared by his father, but inwardly he was still hungry
If it were not for the fact that this matter is recorded in the Bible, we would never have this concept in our natural thinking
In the New Testament the word feast is carried over from the Old Testament in 1 Corinthians 5: 'Let us keep the feast'
The messages we previously heard when we were in Christianity were mostly under the influence of natural concepts
Is there one who, after he was saved, joyfully said that he was invited to a feast and that he is attending the marriage feast of the Lamb?
Every item has two sides-a white side and a black side, a bright side and a dark side, a happy side and a sad side
People on the earth see the dark side and the sad side of things, but God in the heavens sees the bright side and the happy side
When we have tasted Christ and have eaten Him to the full, we no longer want the world even if others offer it to us
In this unleavened bread there are all kinds of elements, such as love, truth, enlightenment, holiness, power, and patience
Rather, it is to open up our spirit and exhibit once again for the angels and Satan to see how we receive Christ into us
Before he comes to the meeting, he examines himself to see if he has offended anyone or if he has committed any sin
On the other hand, the well-behaved brother is like a crawling insect on earth; he is still climbing the mountain
If your private life is not the same as what you declare, then what you do at the meeting is not a declaration but a performance, a show
If your private life is not a life of enjoying Christ and you come just to perform at the meeting, that is false
Our Lord's table is not a performance or a show; it is a testimony, a declaration, telling the whole universe that this is the way we live
When the Lord's Day comes, we all come together to make a declaration once again that this is the way we spend our days
You were at the feast when you were first saved, but you abandoned the feast and fell into degraded Christianity
According to the revelation in Deuteronomy, there are many particular points in the matter of eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord
You enjoy the Lord simply by opening up yourself, by using your spirit to call on His name, and by pray-reading His Word
Whenever we call on the name of the Lord and pray-read His word, we receive a portion of the Lord as a seed into us
According to my own observation, the enjoyment of the brothers and sisters is mostly in the enjoyment of sowing
You may begin to question the practice of calling on the name of the Lord to such an extent that you do not want to call any longer
When you call, 'O Lord' again, He comes to point out that your hair is not cut properly and that you have to take care of this matter
True, manna is good; but it is not good enough because it is the diet of those who wander about in the wilderness
Previously, her husband attended two meetings a week; after her calling and pray-reading, her husband would not go even for half a meeting
Later you will thank and praise the Lord that because you were willing to be dealt with in that way, the life in you grew a little
You may begin to feel good about dealings such as these when the life in you grows a little today and a little more tomorrow
At the same time you can bring the top tenth, the firstfruits, of the produce to the meetings to eat and enjoy with the saints
Without recovering this, it is difficult for the church to mature, for the bride to be made ready, and for the Lord to return
When you have an abundant harvest, you have enough not only to feed yourself but also for inviting brothers and sisters to eat with you
We all offer Christ before God, and we enjoy Christ together with the brothers and sisters after God has been satisfied
The church life, the testimony of the church, is a matter of eating the Lord as the seed and allowing this seed to grow
You are full of Christ, and you bring in your topmost portion before God to enjoy with the saints in the meeting
We cannot gain substance in our testimonies in only a few days; we need to labor for an extended period of time
Since many are devoid of things to present, they have to resort to some amusing activities to make people laugh
Subsequently, the crops in the field, the trees on the mountains, the bulls, sheep, and pigeons on the farm will all grow
