   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CASES IN 1 CORINTHIANS The Problem of Divisions</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With these three main principles in view, we can now consider each of the cases.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first case is the problem of division and sects 1:10 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some in Corinth said that they were of Paul, others were of Apollos, others were of Cephas, and others even claimed that they were of Christ 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These were divisions or sects which arose from the flesh, because their flesh had not been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their flesh lacked the real working of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To say, "I am of Paul" proves that a person is fleshly, that there is no mark of the cross on this person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the cross is applied to our flesh, we will never say that we are of Paul or of anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the negative side, the flesh has to be dealt with, while on the positive side, we must know that Christ is not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 13 asks, "Is Christ divided?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we know Christ, apply Christ, and experience Christ, we will realize that He is one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only so, but because the Head is one, the Body is also one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is one, and the church is one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be sure, if we know Christ, we will know the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why are there many divisions today?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is simply due to the fact that people do not know Christ on the positive side and do not experience the cross on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we know Christ and apply the cross to our flesh, there will be no divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Spontaneously we will realize the reality of the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the principle that governs the first case is Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Problem of a Fleshy Brother</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second case is that of a person who was not only fleshly but fleshy 5:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the record of chapters five and six, the fleshy cases were of several shameful kinds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although they are mentioned in the Word of God, they are not pleasant to read.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No doubt, people can be so fleshy because they neglect the experience of Christ, and they forfeit the experience of applying the cross to their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot be fleshy if we are truly under the work of the cross and experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Problem of Lawsuits among Believers</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The next case recorded in this book concerns a lawsuit, in which brothers took one another to the law 6:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a shame for brothers to go to court to sue one another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 7 says, "Already then it is altogether a defeat to you that you have lawsuits with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why not rather be wronged?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why not rather be defrauded?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the teaching of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if a brother defrauds us, we should be willing to suffer loss and take the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not lose the experience of the cross by filing a lawsuit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may win the case and gain some material things, but we will lose the precious experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should choose to suffer and experience the cross rather than to gain from a lawsuit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the practical experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may talk about the cross, but one day a brother may defraud us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Should we go to court and sue him?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The proper way is to suffer the loss by being defrauded.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although we may suffer the loss of material things, we experience the cross and gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is more precious, and in this way we give glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, if we go to court, that is a real shame to the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those Corinthian brothers went to the law because they neglected the experience of Christ and His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If they had applied the first principle, the principle of Christ and the cross, there would have been no lawsuit.</S>
