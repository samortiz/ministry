   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OLD TESTAMENT TYPES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Old Testament contains many types of the spiritual things revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In fact, nearly every spiritual thing in the New Testament has its type in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The greatest and most all-inclusive type in the Old Testament is the history of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The nation of Israel as a type begins with the first chapter of Exodus and ends with the last book of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First the nation of Israel experienced the passover in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We know that the passover in Exodus 12 is a type.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is actually our passover.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The passover lamb was slain for them and its blood sprinkled on the house.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then they passed through the Red Sea and went into the wilderness where they ate manna and drank the water out of the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All of these different experiences are types.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The passover lamb and even all the aspects of the passover are just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The manna is Christ, and the rock which flowed with water is also Christ flowing as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, even the produce of the land of Canaan is a rich type of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In addition, the whole land of Canaan is an all-inclusive type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The book of Hebrews does not tell us that the good land is Christ; instead it tells us that the good land is a rest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Hebrews 3 and 4 the good land is revealed as the rest to God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They left Egypt, went through the wilderness, passed through the Jordan River, and entered into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Deuteronomy 12:9 calls the good land the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the good land was not merely a rest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's intention in bringing His people, Israel, into Canaan was not only for rest, but for the building up of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only did God's people need rest, but God Himself wanted a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's purpose in bringing His people into the good land of Canaan was to establish His kingdom on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There in the good land God built up a kingdom through, with, and among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was the kingdom of God upon earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before that time, God was the God of heaven Neh 1:4 , and He was anxious and desirous to come down to earth to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, there was a great lack of human coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, He was working, waiting, and expecting to have a group of people who would cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, He brought His people out from the dominion of Satan, out of Egypt, and through the wilderness into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ultimately, He defeated all the enemies in the good land through His people, who built the temple and a city.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the city and the temple were built, that was the building of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the temple was completed and at the time it was being dedicated, God's glory filled it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's glory is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God Himself came down from the heavens to get into His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But He obtained not only a house to inhabit, but also a city to contain the house.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of the city, His habitation was accessible and preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The city, protecting His dwelling place, signifies the kingdom and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God finally had a house upon earth within a city as a symbol of the kingdom in which He could dwell and express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>So the good land was not only a type of Christ as rest to God's people, but also a type of Christ as the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The kingdom is simply the maturity of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is the consummation of our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First we enjoy Christ as the land, and eventually what we enjoy of Christ will become the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we were first saved, we simply enjoyed the Lord Jesus as a little lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At that time we probably ate only a small portion of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From that time we began to eat more and more of the Lord Jesus until eventually we enjoy Him to the full all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The ultimate consummation of the enjoyment of Christ is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We receive Christ into us as our life, and this life rules in us gradually a little today and a little more tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is so patient.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are growing with Him and His life is growing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One day we will have the maturity of His life, which will be the kingdom.</S>
