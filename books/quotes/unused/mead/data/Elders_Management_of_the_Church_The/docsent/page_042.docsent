   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The principle is the same in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the reality of the church and the presence of the Lord are truly among us, authority will definitely be present.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you ask me what this authority is, I cannot tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is just like a nation; as long as there is a government, there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sooner or later you will touch the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once you offend the authority, you will not be able to live a normal life before God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You can still pray, read the Word, and serve the Lord, but the taste within will not be the same; in no way will you have peace any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Oh, brothers, there is something in the church and among God's people that is called authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sooner or later you will confront this thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Never think that it is a certain person who has become your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may say that an officer has become your authority in a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Strictly speaking, however, this is not true either, because officers can change, but the authority still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is difficult to explain what is meant by touching authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not a mere knowledge of a common truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we follow the Lord faithfully and if we really want to walk in the way of the Lord, sooner or later we will encounter something called authority in the Lord's house and in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you do not wish to be confronted with this matter, it is best for you to take the way of Catholicism or to be a nominal member in Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In such a case you will never touch authority, because there is no such thing and no such understanding in those places.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Forgive me for saying this, for I was a member of a denominational church for quite a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I know quite well what goes on in a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There you will never encounter such a thing as authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But soon after I took this way, I touched something that I could never offend, something that, if I tried to offend it, would cause me to find myself unable to live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be unable to live does not mean that I would die.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It means that I would be like that smuggler I could still eat and dress myself, but my life would become unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers, let me say a serious word: if the church in your locality cannot cause others to encounter authority, I can say absolutely that it is not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If that church is truly established by God, surely you will meet such a thing called authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have heard people contending: "Are you saying that you are the church and others are not?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers, there is no need to contend; you can try it yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When you go to some places, you will not encounter authority, whereas in other places you will encounter it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You will touch something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may not be able to explain it, but gradually you will understand that it is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is something that you cannot afford to offend.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you submit to it, you will live, and you will have peace, blessing, and God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, if you oppose it, offend it, and rebel against it, you may still be able to pray, to read the Bible, and to be a Christian, but yet you yourself know what kind of taste there is within you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You have touched something.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is what we mean by knowing authority.</S>
