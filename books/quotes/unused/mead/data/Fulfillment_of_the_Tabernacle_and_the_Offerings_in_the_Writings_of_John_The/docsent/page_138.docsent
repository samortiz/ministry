   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN 3 Scripture Reading: John 14:2-3; 2:16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we covered three illustrations related to the Father's house: Bethel, the tabernacle, and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 1:51 the Lord Jesus refers to Bethel: "Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse indicates that Christ as the Son of Man, with His humanity, is the ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven, joining earth to heaven for the house of God, Bethel Gen 28:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was at Bethel that Jacob poured oil upon the stone so that it might be the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In chapter one of the Gospel of John we have not only the ladder in verse 51, but also the stone in verse 42: "Looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas which translated means a stone ."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, in John 1 there is a strong emphasis on the Spirit, signified by the dove v. 32 , and also on the Lamb vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>29, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lamb produces the stone, and the Spirit is the oil poured upon the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The result is Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, in John 1 we can see Bethel, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, in John 1:14 we have the tabernacle, and in 2:14-16, the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, Bethel, the tabernacle, and the temple in the Old Testament are all fulfilled in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this message we shall consider three other illustrations of the Father's house, all of which are found in the New Testament: the incarnated Word as the tabernacle John 1:14 , the resurrected temple John 2:19-21 , and the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE REAL TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John 1:14 we see that the incarnated Word, God in the flesh, is the real tabernacle: "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This tabernacle is God's dwelling place and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A particular dwelling place is always the expression of the person who dwells there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, the home of a German person will have a German expression.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just as our home is our expression, so God's dwelling place is His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The real tabernacle, God incarnate, is God's dwelling place and also our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John 1 God incarnate, the incarnated Word as God's dwelling place on earth and His expression, had purposed for His chosen people to enter into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter one the real tabernacle was present, expressing God and containing God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jesus was God incarnate, God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was the real tabernacle, God's dwelling place and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As such a tabernacle, He was eager for the disciples to enter into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the disciples were not ready, and there was no way for them to enter into the Lord as the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the picture in the Old Testament, the way to enter into the tabernacle was through the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Unless someone offered something to God on the altar for his sins, an Israelite could not have an entrance into God's tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Likewise, our sin and sins are great obstacles standing between us and the door of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of these obstacles, we do not have a way to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we need Christ as our unique offering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was necessary for Him to die on the cross for us and for our sins in order to cut the way and to make an entrance for us to come into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tabernacle is God incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For us to enter the tabernacle is for us to enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yes, in John 1 the tabernacle was present, indicating that God had come and was abiding among the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, these disciples were not yet in God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although God was among them, they were still outside of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before the incarnation, God was far away from them, dwelling in unapproachable light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But through incarnation He came to dwell among the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way, God became approachable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nevertheless, there was still no way for the disciples to enter into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When He went to the cross as the Lamb of God to die, He removed the obstacles sin, sins, the world, and Satan and He paved the way, and opened the entrance for us sinners to have a free entry into God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we can see what the Father's house is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Father's house in the New Testament was first the tabernacle, God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, this tabernacle was destroyed when Christ was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in resurrection, the Son of God, who Himself is resurrection, not only raised up Himself, but also raised up all those who would believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God, and all His believers became God's many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that through and in Christ's resurrection the many sons of God have been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is the firstborn Son of God, and we, the many sons of God, are stones for the building up of the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This house is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, today's church is the Father's house, the house of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Where are we today?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are not in the tabernacle portrayed in John 1:14.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, we are in the church, which is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church in the New Testament is the second stage of the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The first stage of this house was God incarnate, God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The second stage is Christ resurrected with all His believers, the many sons built up together to be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eventually, this church, the second stage of the Father's house, will consummate in the coming New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation, the last stage, of the Father's house in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today we are neither in the first stage nor in the third, but in the second.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As those who are in the second stage, we are on our way to the third stage.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is of vital importance that we see what the Father's house is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Father's house is a matter of the Triune God through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection working Himself into His believers in order to be fully mingled with them that He may build them up as an organism for His dwelling place and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is also for their dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, the sign of the Father's house points to the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people to produce a mutual dwelling place, a dwelling place for both God and His chosen and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have seen that the incarnated Word as the tabernacle is God's expression John 1:1-2, 14, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This tabernacle is the Father's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The tabernacle, the Father's dwelling place, is full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Grace is God in the Son as our enjoyment; reality is God realized by us in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>John 1:18 says, "No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The incarnated Word, the tabernacle, as God's expression is for the declaration of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The only begotten Son of God declares God with the glory of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, with Christ as the tabernacle we have grace and reality with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>On the mount of transfiguration, in particular, three of the Lord's disciples saw His glory.</S>
