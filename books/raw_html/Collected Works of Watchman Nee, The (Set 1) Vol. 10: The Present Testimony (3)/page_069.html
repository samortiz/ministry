<P>It was the same with Paul. He said, "For I could wish that I myself were a curse, separated from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh" (Rom. 9:3). If Israel could not be saved, he would rather lose his own salvation. These were not just words on his lips, nor were they an outburst of his emotion. The pressure of a need gave him such a feeling. Many times people imitate the prayers of others, but there is no power, and the prayers are useless. This is because there is no pressure. Has anyone ever prayed, "God, if You will not answer me, I will not rise up"? If you have such feelings, and you utter such words, God will surely answer. Perhaps some will go home and say the same words. That is not what is important; what is important is to feel the pressure.</P><P>There was a very good believer in Tsinan. He had a brother who always opposed and ridiculed him in his school class. Last year when I was working at his school, I talked with the unbelieving brother, but he would not believe. His brother used to testify about the Lord very often on the campus and help many others. But one time he stopped testifying and the smile left his face. Another believer told me about his situation when I was there. They were afraid that he was discouraged and backslidden, and they hoped that I could render him some help. Although I met with him several times, he would quickly walk away after we exchanged a few words. I was surprised that he was trying to avoid me. In a conversation with another believer, I was told that there was nothing wrong with him except that his brother had not yet been saved. He would no longer testify unless his brother was saved. The conversation was concluded with the comment: "Although this is what he said, I wonder if there is some other hidden reason." After our last meeting, I talked with the discouraged brother again. I asked him what was the reason for his recent behavior. He answered, "If God will not save my brother, I will never testify of the Lord again." Then I realized that he had a special burden for his brother and was greatly pressured. There could be only two reasons for his situation: either the enemy had deceived and discouraged him from working and advancing, or God intended to save his brother. If God had given him this pressure and was causing him to pray in such a desperate way, his brother would surely be saved. But the pressure on him was too great; he could not get through. That is why he had this kind of reaction. Immediately after I returned home, I received a letter from another brother at that school, telling me that this person's brother was saved. Not long after I left, the unbelieving brother had become very sick. Then he decided to receive the Lord, and he recovered from his illness.</P><P>We can realize a principle from this brother's experience. Before God listens to our prayer, He always puts a great pressure on us so that we have to pray. At first we did not have the power to pray. But with pressure, we can pray. The stronger the pressure is from God, the more powerful our prayers will become. Therefore, let us learn the lesson that pressure produces power. The purpose of pressure is not to oppress us, but to afford us the opportunity to turn it into power. Now we can understand why God listens to some prayers, but not to others. We can understand why God listens to prayers concerning big things, but not to prayers concerning small things. Why does God listen to your oppressed prayer when someone you love, either a friend or co-worker, is very sick? Why does God not immediately answer your prayer when you have a headache, flu, or cut? As I have said before, every prayer that does not touch you can never touch God. This is altogether a problem of power, and power is always determined by pressure.</P><P>Why does God allow difficult things, unsolvable things, and unavoidable things to happen to us? The only reason that God allows these things to come to us is so that we will use the pressure to gain the power to seek for God. Our failure lies in the fact that we do not know how to turn our pressure into power. We know that all pressures have a purpose. We do not have to wait until we are pressed beyond measure before we begin to pray. We have to learn to pray with pressure and without pressure. However, if there is pressure, we should turn it into power. If we turn every pressure into power, we will see that pressure comes for the purpose of manifesting God's power of resurrection. No power is greater than the power of resurrection. If we are pressed, and things are hopeless on all sides, we will clearly feel the power of resurrection rising up within us. If I were to ask how many times our prayers were answered during our lifetime, every one of us could recall at least some prayers that have been answered. Why were those prayers answered? Is it not because the pressure was too great, that we were not able to get through, and that we poured out our hearts to God and He listened? Perhaps we had never fasted before that time. But on that day we found that we had to fast. We felt that we were forced to come to God. We found that prayer was no longer a burden, but the removal of a burden.</P>
