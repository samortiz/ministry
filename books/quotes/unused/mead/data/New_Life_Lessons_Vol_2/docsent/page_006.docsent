   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 Thessalonians 5:23</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The above passage points out strongly that man has three distinct parts: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are three different realms in the universe: physical, psychological, and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because man has three distinct parts, he can contact the things in these three realms.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The body: This is our outer part, which has five senses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is in this part that we have world-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The soul: This is our self, which is the ego, the personality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is between the body and the spirit, and includes our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is here that we have self-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The spirit: This is the deepest part of our being, where we have God-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we can contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE KEY TO CONTACTING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John 4:23</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the teaching of the Bible, and based on the believers experience, there are three functions of the human spirit:</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Conscience: This is the discerning faculty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It discerns right and wrong, and consequently condemns or justifies Rom 9:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Intuition: This is the faculty by which we have the direct sense of God and receive knowledge from God 1 Cor 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fellowship: This is the faculty by which we worship, contact, and communicate with God 1 Cor 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These three parts work constantly together, and their functions are deeply related.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit is the coming of the Triune God to His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to accomplish this divine economy, Christ passed through four major steps: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through such a process, the Spirit of God, who formerly possessed only divinity, is now compounded with the elements of Christ s humanity, His human living, the effectiveness and fragrance of His death, and the power and effectiveness of His resurrection, to become an all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>IV.</S>

   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>John 7:39</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means that before the Lord was glorified, the compound Spirit was not yet in existence.</S>
