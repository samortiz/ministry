I was very happy to hear that you had gone to Szechuan. I used to live in Feng-Jieh and Wan County, which are far away from Chungking. If you follow the Yangtze River upstream, you will pass through them. I asked the Lord to send some of you there to bring them the message of the full gospel of Christ, the perfect position that God has given Him, the revelation of the cross, and the revelation concerning the Body of Christ (the church). I want God's saved children in Szechuan to know about these things. I really would like to go with you. I will continue to pray for the places you will visit and the messages you will give. May God cause rich life to flow into His church through the messages you will preach. I will never forget you and the sisters and will pray for you diligently. I will lift my heart and seek after His will and the path He has chosen for me. As soon as I am clear, I hope I will obey. I am now living in a believer-friend's house in Vancouver. There are many brothers and sisters here. There is a doctor who believes in the Lord who read Mr. Nee's letter and felt that it was so full of light and life that he had to pass it on to other brothers and sisters. They are amazed that the Lord has done such a marvelous work among the believers in China and that He is using them. I am so happy! Greet the sisters that I know. We have the same life and the same hope. May the Lord bless you!</p><p>Your sister,<br />Lena Clarke<br />April 14<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</h2><p>(1) Sister Sung Tien-le's illness has improved. Brother Chao Bi-chen is still in his country home. He has written a letter to the brothers saying that he can ride a bike for forty miles. Thank the Lord! Chefoo cannot communicate with him at present. May the Lord remember him! (from Brother Witness Lee's letter of April 21).</p><p>(2) Sister Chen Bi-kun went to K'un-ming on March 30.</p><p>(3) Brother Zhang Ji-wu's mailing address in Kuei-yang is: 39 Yuan Nei Fu, 157 Chunghua North Road, Kuei-yang, Kweichow.</p><p>(4) Sister Sun Zhu Ming-seng's mailing address is: 13 Pei-Jeng-Dong Street, Floor 2, Dong-Shan, Canton City.</p><p>(5) Sister Yeh Chui-chung and her family have returned from Mo-Gan-Shan to Shanghai. The Sun and Yu families are still there.</p><p>(6) Brother Guan En-chiu's mailing address is: Jesus Chapel, Jin-Ching-Gang, Hai-Men, Chekiang.</p><p>(7) Brother Dai En-tsao has gone to Jiu-Jiang. He still plans to go to Nan-ch'ang.</p><p>(8) Brother Wang Ching-shan has become the director of the Pu-Ai Hospital Pharmacy in Hankow.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>(1) Some brothers have written saying that using an X in place of the name of the receiver of a letter can cause misunderstanding in some instances. Therefore, we have stopped using an X in place of a recipient's name beginning with this issue, with the exception of some official letters for which we have deleted the addresses altogether. Our purpose was to cause our readers to pay attention to the news itself.</p><p>(2) The Sun family and the Yu family in Mo-Gan-Shan and Brother Ruan Chi-yu's family in Hangchow are all safe. We thank God for this! Communication with the churches in northern Kiangsu, Chou County, and Tsingtao is still possible, but money cannot be wired to them. We have not had any letters for a long time from the brothers in Su County. Brother James Chen's letter in this issue tells us the general condition of the region near Amoy. We still need to pray for these places.</p><p>(3) With regard to the offerings for the brothers and sisters in need through the war, Brother Tsi-yi and the editor can only send money to the localities that can receive wires. We will do our best to distribute the offerings. May God lead us to be faithful in all things and accomplish them without making errors. Thank God! Many brothers and sisters are able to care for others because of the grace of God, not because they have an excess. Many of the localities that cared for others have become war zones themselves. Some are in great turmoil. We can only ask God to protect and remember them. We ask the brothers and sisters who are in safe places to open up and remember those brothers and sisters in distress. We must say that in all aspects the grace of God is sufficient for us in these days. Our hearts are full of praise to Him!</p><p>(4) The editor cannot answer many letters individually or quickly. Although we remember many brothers and sisters, we are unable to send each one a letter asking how they are. Our hearts are very sorry about this. Please forgive us.</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />May 29</p><p>In the mountainous countryside of Wan County, Szechuan</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_151.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_153.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 152</div><br></body></html>
