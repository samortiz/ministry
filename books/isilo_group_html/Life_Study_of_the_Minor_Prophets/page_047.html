<h1 class="title">ON OBADIAH</h1>
<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S DEALING WITH ESAU<br />
AND<br />
JACOB&rsquo;S VICTORY FOR THE KINGDOM OF JEHOVAH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Obad. 1-21</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider the prophecy of Obadiah.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Obadiah</h2>
<p>In Hebrew the name Obadiah means &ldquo;the servant of Jehovah.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Obadiah&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Obadiah&rsquo;s ministry was about 880 or 587 B.C. It is hard to determine which date is correct.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of Obadiah&rsquo;s ministry was the southern kingdom of Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of Obadiah&rsquo;s ministry also was the southern kingdom of Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of the book of Obadiah is Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with Esau and Jacob&rsquo;s victory for the kingdom of Jehovah, which is the manifestation of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of Obadiah is that Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with Esau issues in Jacob&rsquo;s victory and possession for the kingdom of God in the age of restoration.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Obadiah has five sections: the introductory word (v. 1a); Jehovah&rsquo;s dealings with Edom (vv. 1b-9); the evils of Edom (vv. 10-14); the day of Jehovah upon all the nations (vv. 15-16); and the issue of Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing (vv. 17-21).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S DEALINGS WITH EDOM</h2>
<p>Verses 1b through 9 are concerned with Jehovah&rsquo;s dealings with Edom. Whereas Esau is the name of a person, the twin brother of Jacob, Edom is the name of a country.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Stirring Up the Nations<br />
to Rise Up against It for Battle</h2>
<p>Jehovah dealt with Edom by stirring up the nations to rise up against it for battle (v. 1b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Having Made Edom Small among the Nations</h2>
<p>God purposely dealt with Edom by making him small among the nations and very much despised (v. 2). As a result, Edom was a lowly nation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Bringing Edom Down from Its Dwelling<br />
in the Lofty Clefts of the Rock to the Ground</h2>
<p>Because of its arrogance Jehovah will bring Edom from its dwelling in the lofty clefts of the rock to the ground (vv. 3-4). The people of Edom were proud of their lofty dwelling and thought that they were higher and more lofty than others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Edom&rsquo;s Being Plundered<br />
by the Thieves and Spoilers</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with Edom included their being plundered by the thieves and spoilers (vv. 5-6). Although they lived in the lofty places, the thieves and spoilers still visited them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Edom&rsquo;s Being Deceived by Its Confederacy</h2>
<p>Edom was also deceived by its confederacy (v. 7). Some nations formed a confederacy with Edom, but eventually they were unfaithful to Edom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Destroying Its Wise Men,<br />
Dismaying Its Mighty Men, and<br />
Cutting Off Each One from the Mountain of Esau</h2>
<p>Jehovah dealt with Edom further by destroying its wise men, dismaying its mighty men, and cutting off each one from the mountain of Esau (vv. 8-9).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of the Minor Prophets &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
