   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST S DEATH A. For Sins, the Righteous</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>on Behalf of the Unrighteous,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That He Might Bring His Believers to God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Peter 3:18 says, For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is true that Christ died on the cross for our sins that we might be forgiven and redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But here Peter said that Christ died for the purpose of bringing His believers to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He not only brought us to God but also into God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. On the One Hand, Crucified in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, Christ was put to death in the flesh, so He was crucified on the cross in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>C. On the Other Hand, Made Alive in the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the other hand, Christ was made alive in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man put Him to death in the flesh, but God made Him alive in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One death was going on, but two things were happening.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is what happens to a grain of wheat which has been sown into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, the grain dies, but there is another element in the grain, the life element.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the grain is dying, its life element grows.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John 12:24 says clearly that Christ was the grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was dying on the cross, on the one hand, in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the other hand, He was growing in the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, He was dying a dying death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, He was dying a living death.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the cross Christ was made alive by God to accomplish God s purpose and even to proclaim God s victory over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Peter 3:18 shows that in Christ s resurrection, His divine part was made alive to impart divinity into His humanity, making His humanity divine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way God, in Christ s resurrection, begot Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 13:33 says that on the day of resurrection God said, Today I have begotten You.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That begetting equals our regenerating.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ was begotten and we were regenerated in the same resurrection, at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This resurrection was a big birth, a big delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Among the human race, no one has ever had twelve children at once.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in the universe there was a divine birth, a divine delivery, in which millions of children were born together with Christ as their firstborn Brother.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>B. In His Resurrection,</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His Humanity Being Designated</S>
