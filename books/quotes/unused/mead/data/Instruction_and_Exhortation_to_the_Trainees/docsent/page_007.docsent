   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRAINING IN LIFE, TRUTH, CAPACITY,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, the full-time training helps us to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, it enables us to grow in the knowledge of the truth concerning God and His eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is to grow in life and in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition, the trainees will grow in their capacity and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This includes the skill, the gifts, and the function to do things for God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the training did not help us to obtain our capacity, it is helping us to grow in our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To grow indicates that we have something already.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But what we have has to be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although we do already have an amount of spiritual, divine capacity, we have grown to some extent in our spiritual capacity since the training began less than a year ago.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must believe that we have made some growth in life, in truth, and in capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fourth thing that the training affords us is to be transformed in our being, our character.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must be transformed in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must grow in three things life, truth, and capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must be transformed in one item character.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A TRANSFORMED CHARACTER TO SERVE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must receive some amount of transformation in what we are in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Humanly speaking, our character may have been very much improved, but that is something false.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What we need is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How much have we been transformed in our character?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The transformation of our character implies a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether we are too slow or too quick, humble or proud, patient or impatient is not a matter of conduct, but of what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What we are today becomes our character.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We who love the Lord must be trained in the growth in life, the growth in truth, the growth in capacity, and in the transformation of our character.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to be transformed, for we cannot serve the Lord as Chinese, Japanese, Americans, or Europeans.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No human beings can serve the Lord except those who have been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just to be regenerated is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need regeneration plus transformation in order to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How much transformation have we received?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may have picked up a lot of knowledge concerning what the Spirit is and what life is, but what about our being?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may have received a lot of knowledge from the training, but no transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may have a great deal of knowledge and a certain amount of growth in life, yet without transformation we will surely cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All of the troubles come from our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Turmoils and rebellion arise from our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to my knowledge and experience, every eight to ten years there is some kind of turmoil within the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every turmoil comes from the natural life, the natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only those who are transformed in what they are do not cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If there were no Chinese, there would be no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With the Japanese it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the Japanese, the Chinese, the Americans, and the Koreans are troublemakers in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As long as we are American, we will cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Californians and the Texans are all troublemakers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The white, the black, the brown, the yellow, and the red all make trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They have to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If this training is successful in life, in truth, and in enlarging our capacity, yet a failure in transforming our character, this training will have accomplished little.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we return to our locality, we may be troublemakers if our natural being has not been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My main concern for this training is that eventually it may not have a good name.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some would say that every trainee that comes out of the full-time training is not that useful because they received a lot of knowledge and life but no transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They would argue that the knowledge and growth in life of the trainees merely equips them to make trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope that our future would not be as in the past in giving people the impression that whoever comes out of the training is qualified and equipped to make trouble.</S>
