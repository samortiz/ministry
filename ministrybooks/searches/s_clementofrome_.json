There are spiritual and godly words in this epistle that have helped many people. However, Clement also mentions the Judaic law with its system of organization. We cannot say that Clement was the first to bring this system into the church, but his epistle does mention it. This shows that the church was already taking the Jewish religion as a model for the organization and administration of the church. Therefore, the transmutation of the organization and administration of the church had begun by the time of Clement.

In his epistles Ignatius separates the overseers and the elders into two groups of people. In Acts 20:17 Paul sent word from Miletus to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him. Verse 28 says that the Holy Spirit had placed these elders among the flock as overseers. Elders in verse 17 is equivalent to overseers in verse 28. The elders are the overseers. Elder refers to the person, and overseer refers to the function. The elders are those who are mature in life, and their function is that of overseeing. When Paul called for them to come, he referred to them as elders, but when he spoke of their function, he referred to them as overseers. Thus, elders and overseers are the same group of people; they are not two groups.

This seed of corruption and error operated within the church until approximately A.D. 250, when Cyprian was bishop of Carthage. Cyprian promoted a hierarchy dividing the bishops from the other clergy beneath them. This hierarchical organization was formed into a unified church called the catholic church. This catholic church was not yet the Roman Catholic Church. When the government of the Roman Empire was mixed with the catholic church, the catholic church began to look more like the Roman Catholic Church. The formal beginning of the Roman Catholic Church dates from when the highest bishop was designated as the pope. At that juncture the church had a pope and archbishops; under the archbishops were the bishops, and under [352] the bishops were the priests. Each locality had priests, several localities were combined into a district under a bishop, and several districts were combined into a large district under an archbishop.

One of them was Clement, who is mentioned in Philippians 4:3; another one was Polycarp, who was a disciple of the aged John and was martyred for the Lord. They suffered a terrible persecution, the persecution by the Roman Empire. The church was persecuted by the Jews soon after it was raised up, but when the church went to the land of the Gentiles, it was persecuted not only by the Jewish religion but also by the Roman Empire. Apparently, there were several reasons for the persecution. First, it was because the gospel preached by Christians was different from the Roman customs. Second, the gospel which they preached caused people to love the Lord, to love God, and to not care for the world; it was a gospel that was focused on pursuing something in the future, something eternal. Such a gospel was altogether contrary to the culture of the Roman Empire and thus gave rise to conflicts. The third reason, which was also the most serious one, was that the Caesar, the Roman emperor, wanted to be worshipped as God by the people.

Although the sisters may have discovered the resurrection, I have discovered something concerning the sisters. The biggest problem for the sisters in the church life is that they are not thinking the same thing. It is very easy for the sisters not to be of one mind. Because of this, many of the divisions in Christianity were caused by the sisters. They have often been the source of division. This is a very serious matter. On the one hand, the sisters are greatly needed. Without the sisters the church is barren.
