   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REGENERATED BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE REALITY OF THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another organic process in the Spirit is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Regeneration is by the Spirit as the reality of the resurrected Christ John 3:6b; 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By the resurrected Christ as life we are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reality of this resurrected Christ is the regenerating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Baptism puts us into the consummated Triune God, and regeneration puts the embodiment of the consummated God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Baptism puts us into Him, and regeneration puts Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a union of life, an organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the time that we believed into Jesus and we were baptized into the consummated God, we got into Him and He got into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He and we were united together organically.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>SEALED WITH THE SPIRIT AS THE ESSENCE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another organic process in the Spirit that we experience is that we are sealed with the Spirit as the essence of God Eph 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are sealed with the Spirit as a living seal, this seal remains.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, the sealing of the Spirit in the New Testament is an ongoing process.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is going on continuously to infuse us with the very essence of God as the ink.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I put a seal full of ink on a piece of paper and kept it there for ten minutes, it would saturate through the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The ink would be transfused into the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit as the essence of God seals us with Himself as the ink in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sealing ink of the Spirit s sealing is the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit s sealing us is to transfuse all that God is into our being, to saturate our being with the very essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such sealing makes us divine and brings our inward parts into an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may say that being baptized into the Spirit, regenerated by the Spirit, and sealed with the Spirit form one group of the organic processes in the Spirit that we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>INDWELT BY THE RESURRECTING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sealing Spirit is now indwelling us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are indwelt by the resurrecting Spirit Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that He remains in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we have the very indwelling presence of the consummated God remaining in our being so that we can enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This One now dwells in us to do a wonderful work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in us to make our spirit life 8:10b , to make our mind life 8:6b , and to give life to our mortal body 8:11b .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>DRINKING OF THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now that we are indwelt by the resurrecting Spirit, we can drink of the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 12:13b .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Spirit left us after He sealed us, we would not be able to drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But He remains in us as a fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can drink of Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and have our being saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>ENJOYING THE SPIRIT AS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE FIRSTFRUIT OF GOD AS OUR PORTION</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are also enjoying the Spirit as the firstfruit of God as our portion Rom 8:23a .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has allotted Himself to us as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that He has given Himself to us as our lot.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The indwelling, remaining Spirit is the lot within us today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we can enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every believer, to one degree or another, has experienced drinking of the remaining Spirit and enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our favorite foods are very tasty, rich, and satisfying to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same way that we enjoy our favorite foods, we need to enjoy the indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We drink of Him and we enjoy Him as the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The firstfruit means the first taste, and our enjoying of the first taste indicates that the full taste is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are now in the stage of enjoying the firstfruit, which is the fresh Spirit, the fresh consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Triune God was consummated, He became the firstfruit to us, and now we are enjoying the fresh consummated God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many of the Jews will believe in the Lord Jesus when He returns Zech 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But by that time the firstfruit will have become the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These Jews will have missed the firstfruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By the Lord s mercy, we are all tasting the fresh, consummated Triune God today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our being indwelt by the resurrecting Spirit, drinking of the life-giving Spirit, and enjoying the Spirit as the firstfruit form another group of the organic processes in the Spirit that we experience.</S>
