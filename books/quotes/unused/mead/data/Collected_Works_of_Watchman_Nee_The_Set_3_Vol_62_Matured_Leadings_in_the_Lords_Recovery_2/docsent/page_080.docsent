   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Purpose of Having a Good Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the result of having a sterling spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If all the brothers and sisters in the church have a pure and noble spirit, they will mutually supply one another, and the church will be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I became a Christian at the end of 1919.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the beginning of 1920 I met a sister, Miss M. E. Barber, from whom I received much help.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This help did not come merely from her words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through meeting with her, staying or walking with her, my spirit was nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With some people one receives the supply only when they speak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With Miss Barber this was not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She only needed to sit in front of you, and you would receive nourishment and the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the genuine spiritual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not a matter of doing something or saying something.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whoever learns more lessons has more spiritual deposit and can render more supply to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>IN ORDER TO SERVE, WE MUST FIRST LEARN</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are learning to serve as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must have proper spiritual feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must contact the spirit all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise, all the so-called services to God will be nothing but self-deceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our service to God must be the result of our spiritual response to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When spirit touches spirit, there is a spiritual response.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order for our spirit to be touched, others' spirit must first touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A man's joy, tears, or words cannot touch our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only spirit can touch spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to serve God and to receive His leading, we must open our spirit to God to touch His Spirit and others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every service that is void of the spirit carries no value before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order for the whole church to have a service that is spiritual, we must have a right spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When my spirit opens up and the spirits of all the brothers and sisters open up, and when all of us touch God and serve Him in our spirit, we have the service of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we serve according to our mind, wisdom, and emotion, our spirit will be closed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The exercise of the spirit is a great matter in our meeting and service.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must all learn to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How do we know if something is done correctly in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It depends on how our spirit reacts and judges it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our judgment and fellowship are based on the spirit, not on the preponderance of opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In preaching the gospel, if our speaking only issues from our "wonderful" mind, we will only touch others' mind; we will not touch their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to touch man's spirit, we have to learn to not use words from our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not use words that the spirit does not use.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we continue to reject what the spirit rejects, our spirit will be high.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the coming days, our judgment of a co-worker's message, our evaluation of the brothers' and sisters' testimonies, and our assessment of the sermons of the revivalists should be based on the spirit of the speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should ask if there is a supply of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once a blind man sees, he will exercise his other faculties less and use his eyes more.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can say the same thing about our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to learn to use our spirit more and our mind less.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we use the organs in our body, such as our arm and muscles, the stronger they become.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The same is true with our spirit; the more we use it, the stronger it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Let me say this to the young brothers and sisters: If you sense much prompting in your spirit while you pray, you can pray more.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if there is little prompting in your spirit, your prayer should be short.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can learn by checking with the older brothers and sisters every time after we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After we have learned this a few times, we will know the true condition of our spirit, and we can pray according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we pray and hear many "amens" around us, it does not mean that we are necessarily right.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of course, if there is no "amen," we should put a question mark on our prayer and should try to determine whether or not it was of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Short prayer is not necessarily right; neither is long prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Much noise may not be right, and silence may not be right either.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If our speaking and silence are not under the control of the Holy Spirit, they are both an offense to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The young brothers and sisters are inexperienced in their learning.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, they must learn to humble themselves and ask.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the saints feel that someone's prayer or speaking is out of place, they should point this out to the speaker in an honest way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If they do not tell the speaker, but "send telegraphs" by glancing around behind his back, they are forming parties in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must not coordinate together in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our spirit must be weighty and excellent in its quality.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May God be merciful to us so that we may learn more lessons this way.</S>
