Even the life element (the entire meal made of the grains produced by the wheat), of which the church is constituted, is leavened. This disease of the church is in its constituents. Such a disease of being corrupted by being leavened is incurable.</P></ol><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
