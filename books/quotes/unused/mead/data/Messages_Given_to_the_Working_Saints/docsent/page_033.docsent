   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Found in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only did Paul suffer the loss of all things and count them refuse, but he pursued to be found in Christ Phil 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He desired to be seen by others as a man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In all things, great or small, and especially in his daily living, he was seen by others to be a man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we love the world and pursue after it, others will surely not recognize us as Christians, because our goals, inclinations, and tastes are all worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is not manifested that much in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul desired earnestly for Christ to be manifested in him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only was he free from sin and the world, but he was full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was what he was pursuing after.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>REWARDS FROM GAINING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The rewards received from gaining Christ are twofold.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One is in this life, to be gained while one is alive on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The other is in the coming life, to be gained in the kingdom when the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moses Becoming the One to Usher in the Old Testament Ministry Establishing the Law a Testimony of God among Men</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moses was made a person to usher in the Old Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although Abraham was noble, he did not bring in the Old Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is the Old Testament ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, it is the establishing of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today, we are too familiar with grace and have therefore overlooked the law and have even despised the value of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, the law is not only the Ten Commandments with their many regulations and ordinances for man to keep; the law is a description depicting the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before Moses brought in the law, not one patriarch could describe God in a way that could compare with the way the law did.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In God's laws, especially in the Ten Commandments, God's characteristics are fully depicted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Ten Commandments depicted God as the One who is love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today, the whole world bases its laws on the Roman law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the Roman law has as its basis the Ten Commandments of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, the reward of Moses was a tremendous one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was the one who brought in the Old Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first thing this ministry did was to bring the law of God to man, as a testimony of God among men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Building the Tabernacle a Habitation of God among His People</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second item in the Old Testament ministry was the building up of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>None of the patriarchs, including Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, brought God's habitation to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was Moses who built a habitation for God on earth among the Israelites, making it possible for God to dwell with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the second great reward which Moses obtained in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moses Being Qualified to Enter the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moses may have been the first one to enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord said in Matthew 16:28: "There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After six days, the Lord took Peter, James, and John to a high mountain, and He was transfigured before their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There He unveiled His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moses and Elijah were also there conversing with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was a miniature of the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There was the law represented by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, Moses took the lead to enter into the kingdom.</S>
