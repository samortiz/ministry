<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>We are impotent people who are dead in sin and cannot be saved or healed by any method, effort, or religion. Only the living Savior, Jesus Christ, with His powerful life can save us from death and impotence. But how does one receive His salvation?</p>
<p>You first need to hear His word, the gospel of life, which is also His voice. He said, &ldquo;He who hears My word and believes...has eternal life and...has passed out of death into life&rdquo; (John 5:24). He also said, &ldquo;The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live&rdquo; (v. 25). These verses show that in order to receive His salvation of life and pass out of death into life, you must hear His word. His word is the gospel of life, which is His voice. His word comes out of Him as the Lord of life; hence, it contains His life. When you hear His life-containing word, His life will enter into you and save you, and you will pass out of death into life.</p>
<p>That day the man who had been sick for thirty-eight years was saved by hearing the word of the Lord Jesus. This man began to hear the voice of the Lord Jesus when the Lord asked, &ldquo;Do you want to get well?&rdquo; (v. 6). This was the voice of the Lord&rsquo;s gospel. When the Lord said, &ldquo;Rise, take up your mat and walk&rdquo; (v. 8), this man heard more of the Lord&rsquo;s word. The word of the Lord&rsquo;s gospel, His voice of life, touched the impotent man&rsquo;s inward being, which was full of death, and caused him to have the vitality of life. Therefore, he was able to rise, take up his mat, and walk. He passed out of death into life and was made alive by hearing the Lord&rsquo;s word. As soon as he heard the Lord&rsquo;s word, he lived. Hence, people can be made alive and have the Lord&rsquo;s life by hearing His word, His voice. This is how to receive living salvation.</p>
<p>After hearing the Lord&rsquo;s word, you need to believe in His word in order to receive the Lord. When you hear the Lord&rsquo;s word, you must believe and receive it so that His word can manifest its power. You must believe and receive the Lord&rsquo;s word so that it can enter into you to save you. The Lord&rsquo;s word contains His life. Therefore, when you believe and receive His word, His word enters into you, enabling you to receive the life contained in His word. This life is the Lord Himself; hence, it is divine and eternal, and it possesses the power of resurrection and unlimited strength. When this life enters into you, it will raise you from the dead, changing your weakness into strength and turning your sorrow into joy.</p>
<p>The man who had been sick for thirty-eight years received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation of life by believing and receiving the Lord&rsquo;s word. When he heard the Lord say, &ldquo;Rise, take up your mat and walk,&rdquo; he believed and received the Lord&rsquo;s word. As a result, the life and power in the Lord&rsquo;s word enabled him to rise, take up his mat, and walk. This was the Lord&rsquo;s life entering into him through the Lord&rsquo;s word in order to be his power for his salvation.</p>
<p>Examples of the Lord&rsquo;s word of the gospel in the Bible include: &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life&rdquo; (3:36); &ldquo;He who believes into Him is not condemned&rdquo; (v. 18); &ldquo;With the heart there is believing unto righteousness&rdquo; (Rom. 10:10); &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rdquo; (v. 13). As long as you are willing to believe and receive His word, you will receive the Lord&rsquo;s life and His salvation.</p>
<p>You must believe in the Lord&rsquo;s word in order to receive His salvation. The Bible is the Lord&rsquo;s word. Therefore, if you want to receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, you must believe in the Bible. If you do not believe in the Bible, you cannot believe in the Lord&rsquo;s word or in the Lord, because the Bible testifies concerning the Lord (John 5:39-40). The Lord spoke many words, and many portions in the Bible refer to the Lord. Nevertheless, to believe in the Bible but not believe in the Lord is not possible. The Bible and the Lord are inseparable. We cannot be saved if we separate the Bible from the Lord. The Jews separated the Scriptures from the Lord. They believed in the Scriptures, but they would not believe in the Lord. They searched the Scriptures, but they would not come to the Lord to receive life; they would not receive the Lord as their life. As a result, they could not receive the salvation of the Scriptures, which is the salvation of the Lord. Many people are like this. They study the Bible, appreciate the Bible, agree with the Bible, and even believe in the Bible, but they are not willing to come to the Lord, to call on Him, to believe in Him from their heart, or to receive Him as their Savior. They contact the Bible without contacting the Lord. They contact the Bible of letters but do not contact the living Lord. As a result, they receive only doctrines and letter; they do not receive a living salvation, the salvation of life.</p>
<p>The Bible of letters cannot save you; only the living Lord can save you. This living Lord is revealed through the Bible in order for you to receive Him. He put Himself in the words of the Bible in order for you to receive Him. Therefore, if you want to receive the Lord, you must receive the words of the Bible, and if you want to receive the words of the Bible, you must also receive Him. If you believe and receive the words of the Bible in such a way, you will receive the Lord into your being and have His life for your salvation.</p>
<p>You may say, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus is far away from me in space and in time. How can He come into me?&rdquo; You need to realize that the Lord Jesus is God and the Spirit; He is eternal and omnipresent. Therefore, as long as you believe in His word and receive Him as your Savior, regardless of the time and the place, He, as the Spirit, will enter into you and give you His life for your salvation. This is not superstition. Many things that we encounter in our daily life are according to this principle. For example, many people have radios in their homes. They only need to turn on the power and tune to the right channel in order for the radio waves in the air to be transmitted into the radio. This is not superstition. The radio waves are everywhere in the air. As long as a radio has a corresponding channel and the power is on, the radio waves will be transmitted into the radio, and there will be sound. Likewise, the Lord Jesus is the Spirit, and He is everywhere in the universe; He is not limited by time. Your heart is like a radio, and repenting, believing, and receiving Him are the way to turn on the radio of your heart and tune it to the right channel. Then He will enter into you, and His life will begin to operate, giving you a living salvation from within. This is not superstition; this is reality. This is as real as radio waves being transmitted into a radio and producing sound. The Lord Jesus is real, the Spirit is real, and His life is also real. It is also real that today He is the Spirit who comes into people in order for them to receive His life. If you repent and believe, that is, open to Him, receive Him as your Savior, and call upon Him, He will enter into you, and you will receive His life and be made alive. Then you will know how effective and real He is.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>A person who believes and receives the Lord into his being receives the Lord&rsquo;s life; he receives the eternal, uncreated, divine life of God. This life has the power of resurrection. A person who receives this life will be made alive inwardly and will pass out of death into life. The life of God will become the vitality in his being, motivating him to do what he is unable to do in himself, just as electricity enters into an electrical fan and makes it turn.</p>
<p>Formerly we were dead and impotent, powerless within. Then the Lord&rsquo;s life entered into us. This life is vitality, a power that motivates us. It is like electricity. The impotent man had been sick for thirty-eight years; he was lying on a mat and had no strength to move. But as soon as he received the Lord&rsquo;s word, the power of the Lord&rsquo;s life enabled him not only to rise and walk but also to take up his mat. Formerly the mat carried him; now he took up the mat and walked. The Lord&rsquo;s life is able to strengthen an impotent man to such an extent.</p>
<p>Some people were unable to live without mah-jongg, without smoking and drinking, without dancing, or without watching movies. Movies were their &ldquo;bed,&rdquo; and mah-jongg was their &ldquo;mat&rdquo; from which they could not rise. After they believed in the Lord and His life entered into them, they were empowered to overcome and rule over these sinful things, taking up the sinful &ldquo;mats&rdquo; that used to carry them and walking away.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the living Savior. His life is powerful, and He can enliven the dead, strengthen the impotent, and deliver people from what binds them. May you receive Him as your Savior so that you may receive His salvation of life.</p>
