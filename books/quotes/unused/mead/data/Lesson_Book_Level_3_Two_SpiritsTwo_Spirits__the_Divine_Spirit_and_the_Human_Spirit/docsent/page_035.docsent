   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Adding the Divine Element</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the Triune God reaches us today, He comes as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The moving of this Spirit is the anointing within 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Triune God dwells in us as the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the ointment moving within....He is not dormant within us; rather, He is living, moving, acting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the anointing, which is the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit moving in us to saturate us with God's essence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This anointing adds to us the very essence of God, the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is similar to the process of painting a table.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As you paint the table, the element of the paint is added to the table.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, as the ointment runs through us, it brings the divine element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Lord's recovery we have the assurance that day by day something is running through us, doing an inward "painting" work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more this ointment moves, the more it paints us with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hallelujah, the divine element is being added to us in the Lord's recovery!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not a matter of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Something is running over us and through us, and the divine element is being accumulated within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we enjoy the flowing of the inner life and the more we enjoy the Lord together in the meetings, the more we have God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we may still feel that we are weak, we nevertheless have God within, for the anointing is constantly adding the divine element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE SEALING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After the anointing comes the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sealing is rather easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Any kind of painting is also a sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A. Indicating Ownership</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 1:13-14 says, "You were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise...unto the redemption of the acquired possession."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have been made God's inheritance v. 11 . At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God's image signified by the seal, thus making us like God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose a brother puts a seal on his Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he does so, his Bible bears the image of the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This seal indicates that the Bible belongs to him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the seal signifies ownership.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God sealed us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This signifies that God is our owner and that we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>B. Bearing the Image of God</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every seal has an image.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the seal is square, then the image is also square.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit as the seal of God upon us bears the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This implies that the seal of the Holy Spirit is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you bear the Holy Spirit as the seal of God upon you, you bear the image of God and the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet, if you check your daily living you must admit that you have very little expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you are quarreling with your parents do you bear the image of God?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many of us can testify from experience that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, we realized that we had been sealed in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, in our mind, emotion, and will there was no sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the time we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit came into our spirit and sealed us there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason the Bible says that we were sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, not every part of our being was sealed, but just one part, our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For a long time after we were saved, there continued to be no sealing in our mind, emotion, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But Ephesians 1 says that we were sealed unto redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not our initial redemption but the redemption or glorification of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word "unto" means "resulting in" or "with a view to."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the sealing in our spirit is with a view to the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This implies that the sealing is spreading within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It begins in our spirit and it is spreading into our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have a living seal in us; it is constantly moving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After the Spirit seals one part of us, He desires to seal another part and then another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He wants to seal every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Until this is completed, the spreading of the sealing will continue.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Are you under the Spirit's sealing today?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Is it still going on within you?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to have the assurance that the sealing of the Spirit is spreading in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When our whole being has been sealed, we shall be ready for the redemption of the body.</S>
