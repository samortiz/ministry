   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Eating Things Strangled</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Leviticus 17, as well as in other portions of the Old Testament, there is also an ordinance against eating strangled animals.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Acts 15 says that anything strangled should not be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is also related to the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The blood of a strangled animal is not separated from the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not take other blood because we maintain that there is only one salvation in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the reason that God s children should reject all other blood; they should not eat it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>C. There Being No Difference</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>between the Clean and the Unclean Today 1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Unclean Animal Being Forbidden</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>in the Old Testament</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Leviticus 11 God gave the Israelites a list of clean beasts which they could eat and a list of unclean beasts, such as creeping things, which they could not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some fish in the sea are edible, while others are not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Similarly, some fowls in the air are edible, while others are not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Carnivorous birds are not edible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fish that have fins and scales are edible, while those that do not have fins and scales are not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Leviticus contains a list of ordinances regarding what is clean and what is unclean, and what can be eaten and what cannot be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This list encompasses fish in the sea, birds in the air, creeping things, and beasts on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many have pondered on the significance of the regulations in Leviticus 11.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Should the New Testament believers keep the same regulations?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us turn to Acts 10.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As Peter was praying on the housetop, a trance came upon him and he saw heaven opened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A certain vessel like a great sheet descended, being let down by four corners onto the earth, in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These were all forbidden by God in Leviticus 11.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God said to Peter, Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Acts 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter was a Jew; he had kept the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said to the Lord, By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean v. 14 . Then a voice came to him the second time, saying, The things that God has cleansed, do not make common v. 15 . This occurred three times.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Afterward, the vessel was immediately taken up into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Matter of Choice in the Old Testament</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to realize that the ordinances in Leviticus 11 give us a hint of the teaching in Acts 10.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s mind is not on what kind of fish one can eat; His mind is not on what kind of animal one can eat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Did God not think of such things when He gave all the living creatures to Noah for food?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Noah s time there was no distinction between clean and unclean; everything could be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why then was there a distinction of the clean and unclean in Leviticus 11?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During Noah s time God had not made a choice concerning His own people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By the time of Leviticus, however, God had made a choice He had chosen Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Israelites came out of Egypt and were chosen to be God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, there was a separation between God s people and those who were not His people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God did not raise the matter of choice during the time of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The matter of clean and unclean only occurred at the time of the exodus when there was a separation between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The question of who were God s people and who were not became an issue at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From that time forward, there was a distinction between clean things which were edible and unclean things which were not edible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One group of people could enter the fellowship, while the other group could not.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God was pleased with one group of people but not with the other.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Food became a symbol of this distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Food is not merely food; it is something that shows a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Edible things indicate things that are pleasing to God, while forbidden things indicate things that are not pleasing to God.</S>
