<h2 class="head1">A LETTER ABOUT THE CONDITION<br />OF THE WORK IN SOUTHEAST ASIA</h2><p>Peace to my brother in the Lord, T'eng Ming:</p><p>Yesterday, Brother P'ei Jan passed your letter on to me, and I got to know that you have placed me in the Lord's love and remember me continually. I really thank the Lord for His grace, and I thank you for your love. I sent a letter to you previously with some old letters that Brothers Wang and Chang of Singapore had sent to me. I think you must have received and read them. The Lord has led the brothers meeting in Singapore to break through the difficult situation caused by problems they have encountered. They have withdrawn from the Gospel Hall, and the Lord has established His table in Brother Kai Sen's home. Before they held their first table meeting, I was led by the Lord to go to Singapore in June and have some deep prayer with Brothers Wang and Chang to seek the Lord's will concerning our future. Our brothers are of the same mind, which is that they really cannot join together with the Gospel Hall. Although the door is the same (referring to the first step of salvation), the way is very different. We take the Lord Himself as our center, not the Lord's truth. The Gospel Hall takes another name apart from the Lord's name; therefore, we are not satisfied and dare not go along with them. Our brothers had some disagreements with the brothers from the Gospel Hall concerning the interpretation of the Bible. If they came out from them immediately, we were afraid they would misunderstand and think that our brothers were dividing the Lord's Body over the interpretation of the truth. They might have placed the burden for division onto our brothers' shoulders. Therefore, we first cleared up the dispute over the truth and then began the table meeting. We continue on by following the leading of the Holy Spirit, lest we fall into error once again. May the brothers and sisters who have the same mind in China pray much for the assemblies in Southeast Asia.</p><p>If the Lord is willing, I will probably take Brother Cheng Kai Hao from Jou Pu to visit my brothers and sisters in Sitiawan with me. We want to combine the work in the three localities of Shir Li, Bi Nun, and Sitiawan, making Sitiawan the center of the work. We hope that a gifted brother could come to Sitiawan and serve the brothers full-time so that the brothers in all the localities could receive the Lord's edification. We are placing this matter in prayer and asking the Lord to do it. The brothers and sisters with the same mind in Bi Nun still meet in the Gospel Hall because some of the brothers have not seen that the Gospel Hall is a sect; therefore, they do not want to divide from them. We still need to wait for the Lord's time. My responsibility in the leper colony is not binding. I can go ahead with all work according to the light the Lord gives me. I am now learning the lesson of serving the Lord. It suits me to live on this quiet sea island. The Lord has already begun a good work in Southeast Asia. It will be impossible to avoid battles in the future, but we few brothers in Southeast Asia have not been edified deeply. I am afraid that we will not be able to handle the oppression of our environment. If the Lord does not send someone to bear the responsibility in Southeast Asia, we entreat Him to open the way for one of the brothers among us to go to Shanghai and be trained by the Lord in Brother Nee's place. We hope that the shameful would leave their shamefulness to become holy and useful to the Lord. Please bear the burden to pray for us. Brother Chang Nai Tsung is working in Singapore. If it is the Lord's will, he will live there for some time and serve the brothers. The Lord recently established His table in Jou Fu. A few brothers there testified to His grace. They are now very much alone because they are too far from me. I cannot visit them often. They often go to Singapore and receive comfort and encouragement from Brothers Chang and Wang. The work here really needs your prayers. May our gracious Lord support us in finishing the course He has appointed us. May all the glory be given to His name.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Yang Chien Hsiung<br />August 19, 1934</p>
