   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE GOD'S DEALING WITH MAN'S FIRST FALL 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we need to consider some further points on the way God deals with man's first fall.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Discipline of Man by Suffering</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we have seen, after man fell God did not come to condemn him, but to seek him and to judge the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His condemnation on the serpent God proclaimed the promise regarding the seed of the woman Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, that was not the end. Although God had proclaimed the promise of His salvation, man still remained in a troubled situation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only was man in a difficult situation, but a sinful element had been injected into his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, man is both sinful outwardly and also corrupted inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God had no intention of condemning man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All that God had in His heart toward man was love, and man was fully under God's loving care.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, God ordained some suffering for man's benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although we do not like suffering, God has ordained it nonetheless.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1 The Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the purpose of the sufferings ordained by God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The primary purpose is to restrict man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sufferings appointed by God are actually our security and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Never forget that as a result of the fall man has a corrupted and corrupting element in his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God loves man and exercises a loving concern over him, but man still has a satanic element in his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Immediately after the fall man probably did not realize his true condition; however, God understood the problem and thus He ordained sufferings for the purpose of restricting fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Young people throughout the world want freedom; they desire to have their liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, we must realize that too much freedom removes the restrictions that God, in His love, has placed upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As fallen men with a corrupted nature, we definitely need restrictions as a protection and safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose a mother has a naughty boy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If she does not exercise any restrictions over him, that child would not live for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He would kill himself as a result of having too much freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No mother is so foolish as to give complete liberty to a naughty child.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All children need restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Restrictions are good for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As an older person I need to be and I love to be restricted by my dear brothers in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am restricted even more by the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually I have very little freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you were to offer me freedom, I would say, "No thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You take your freedom home with you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I need restriction."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How I thank the Lord that in all the past years I have been protected by restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have not suffered under the restriction of the saints, but have rather enjoyed it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the limitations rendered to me by my brothers and sisters in the Lord have been my protection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although, at present, you may not think that restrictions are pleasant, after the passing of years I believe that you will worship the Lord and say, "Thank the Lord for restrictions!"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let me say a word about husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No woman likes to be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The dear sisters may be holy and seek after spirituality, but I do not believe that they are fond of being restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A wife does not like to accept any restraint from her husband or mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have learned from history and from experience that not many daughters-in-law like their mothers-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It seems that this comes from God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God ordained that the mother-in-law be a restriction to the daughter-in-law and that the daughter-in-law be a problem to the mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Humanly speaking, this does not sound pleasant, but actually it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Any sister who is willing to accept restrictions from her husband, children, and mother-in-law will be protected.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now I turn to the husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We brothers certainly need the restrictions that come from our wives.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I thank the Lord for my dear wife.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I can testify that the best help which she has given me has been her restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She even restricts my eating.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although my stomach belongs to me, she determines how much I eat.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Day after day I tell her, "I'm still hungry," but she answers, "It is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no more."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually, however, as a result of accepting her limitations, my stomach trouble was cured.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have learned that if you have stomach trouble or a stomach ulcer the best way to deal with it is to be restricted in your eating.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, any restriction is truly a great help.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all need restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, God ordained suffering to man to restrict him, to rescue him by discipline, and to guard him.</S>
