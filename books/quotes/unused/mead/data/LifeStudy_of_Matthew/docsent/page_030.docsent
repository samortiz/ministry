   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 LED AGAIN BY THE STAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO FIND AND WORSHIP CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the magi saw the star again, the star led them to the place where Christ was vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The star led them not only to the city of Bethlehem, but to the exact spot where Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christians often say that to know the Lord it is sufficient to have only the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a sense, I agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, in another sense I say this carefully I do not agree fully.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although we have the Bible, we still need a living vision.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible does say that Christ will be born in Bethlehem, but it does not say where, on what street, or in which house.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The living star led the wise men to the city of Bethlehem and also to the exact street and the house where the child was.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that place, the star stopped v. 9 . The magi did not need to knock on any doors; they knew where Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This proves that we all need a clear, up-to-date vision that leads us directly to the place where Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The magi not only found Christ; they also worshipped Him v. 11 . Among the Israelites, no one was allowed to receive worship from others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That was considered an insult to God, a blasphemy against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to them, only God was worthy of people s worship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the wise men worshipped a child, and that child was God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Isaiah 9:6 says, Unto us a child is born...and his name shall be called...The mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The child found by the magi was called the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The wise men worshipped Him and they offered to Him gold, frankincense, and myrrh v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to know the meaning of the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the typology of the Bible, gold signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that the child Jesus had the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was divine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Frankincense signifies the fragrance of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to our naturally religious mentality, the resurrection of Jesus came only after His death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, before He died, Jesus told Mary and Martha that He was the resurrection and the life John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, even before He died, He was the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The life Christ lived on this earth was a life of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Luke 2:52 tells us that even in His childhood He found favor with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That was not something natural; it was the life of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The record in Luke 2 reveals that the child was an extraordinary child.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was a unique child because He was a child in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In His entire human life and living there was the fragrance, the sweetness of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Death could not hold Him or even touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only was He the life He was resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Myrrh signifies death and also the fragrance of death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Among the human race, death has no fragrance; however, with Jesus there was the fragrance of death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the wise men presented the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh, I do not believe they knew the meaning of the gifts they offered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They surely offered their gifts under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They presented gold, frankincense, and myrrh, signifying that the child Jesus had the divine nature; that His life would be a life of resurrection, full of the fragrance of frankincense; and that His life would be full of the fragrance of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Jesus was twelve years old, He went to Jerusalem with His parents Luke 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because He was burdened to see what people were doing in His Father s house, the temple, He stayed in Jerusalem after the feast Luke 2:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mary and Joseph did not understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They looked for Him and eventually found Him in the temple vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>44-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In a sense, Mary rebuked Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If I had been Jesus, I would have rebuked her.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I would have fought back and said, Don t you know what I m doing here?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why do you come to bother Me?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we read Luke s account, we shall see that Jesus did say something to them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said, Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father? v. 49 . After He said this, He went along with them and returned with them to Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That was a real killing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His intention was killed, and in that killing we can smell myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That was not the fragrance of frankincense; it was the sweet aroma of myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we read the four Gospels, the biographies of Jesus, we shall see that in the life of Jesus the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh were very prevalent.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was always living the resurrection life, and He was constantly under the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He did not wait until thirty-three and a half years had passed before He went to the cross to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Throughout His whole life He was continually being crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, He had not only the fragrance of resurrection, but also the sweet myrrh of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The wise men found the kingly child Jesus in Bethlehem, which Micah 5:2 tells us is little among the thousands of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was born in such a humble town in such lowly circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, due to the vision that came through the star, the wise men paid their full respect to the kingly child, not caring about the place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, they offered to Him the three precious items.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Each of these items signifies some precious element of the Lord Jesus nature and life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In nearly every page of the four Gospels, we see the preciousness of the Lord s humanity, the fragrance of His resurrection life, and the sweet aroma of His sacrificial death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even in the early days, soon after the Lord s birth, the wise men did such an appropriate thing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It exactly suited the Lord s nature and life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Their offering was certainly presented under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It may be that these precious treasures offered by the magi provided for the Lord s trip from Judea to Egypt and from Egypt to Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The worship and offering of the wise men truly accomplished something.</S>
