<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH AS THE GARDEN OF GOD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING A GARDEN<br />
FULL OF ORGANIC FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>The church is like a garden. As Paul said, our work in the church is that of planting and watering while God alone causes the growth (1 Cor. 3:6-7). Furthermore, the church is not an organization but a living organism. The past condition of a church in a locality cannot be compared with its present condition because the church is an organism with organic functions and the ability to grow.</p>
<p>What is it to have an organic function? Suppose there is a table here with a chair next to it and with a cup on top of it. These three things would never generate any kind of organic function. They would remain in the same position after one year, three years, or even ten years. Nothing would grow from them; rather, they would become dirtier, older, more faded, and less attractive. This is because the table, the chair, and the cup do not have any organic function. However, suppose there is an orchard that has just been planted with tree seedlings. At first these seedlings may seem quite small and unsightly, almost ready to wither, yet after exposure to the sun and the rain, these unsightly fruit trees start to grow and even bring forth fruit. This is the inherent organic function of fruit trees.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, organic functions need to be developed. The seedlings may not be very evident in the first couple of years, but they will be manifested by the third year. After a while the formerly unsightly, small tree seedlings will grow quite big and tall and will begin to produce fruit. Even though initially they might have looked like they were about to die, eventually they will be so living and exuberant. Initially there might not have been even a single leaf, but eventually they will be full of green leaves. This kind of situation fills us with joy. The reason for our joy is that the manifestation of the organic functions fills us with hope.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A HISTORY OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY IN MANILA</h2>
<p>When I came to Manila thirty years ago, the situation was completely different from the present situation. At that time the church life was not very active. I could not see much fruit being produced, nor could I see the organic functions being manifested in the services. Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, He arranged for me to come here and to have three groups of people contact me. The first group was a group of eight to nine elders. One brother took the lead to tell me that both the church and the work had not been built up. Therefore, he said that they would like to hand over the church completely to me for me to take the lead.</p>
<p>The second group was a group of eight to nine co-workers, who were represented by a senior co-worker. He told me that the work here had never been built up and that they were ashamed of this. Therefore, he was representing the co-workers in their desire to place the work under my leadership. On the same night, all the deacons and deaconesses gathered at a sister&rsquo;s home. They sent a brother as their representative to tell me that they had not been serving properly in the church and that they too would like to hand over to me the service of the church for me to take the lead. These three groups of people, in three separate places and times, expressed the same desire.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks on December 31, the end of that year, I called for a meeting and gathered these three groups of people together. In the meeting I said to them, &ldquo;I have been here for one and a half months. The elders, co-workers, and deacons have all said to me that they want to hand over to me the church, the work, and the service here for me to take the lead. When we are sent by the Lord to a certain place, there are two ways to carry out the work. One way is to help the church in that locality in the carrying out of its work. The other way is to assume full leadership in the church in that locality after the church has handed itself over to us. Since we are all before the Lord, we must be honest about our situation. Now all of you are willing to let me take the lead; I wish to know from you what kind of leadership you are expecting from me. In other words, do you want me to come here just to help you, or do you want me to assume full leadership?&rdquo;</p>
 <p>I remember very clearly that after I said this the leading elder stood up to say that, as the representative of the elders, he would like to hand the church entirely to me and would ask me to assume full leadership. After a while, a senior co-worker also stood up to say that, as the representative of the co-workers, he would like to hand over the work and would ask me to assume full leadership. Following that, the deacons, represented by one of the brothers, also indicated to me that they were willing to put themselves fully under my leadership. Therefore, I said, &ldquo;Thank the Lord that all of you co-workers, elders, and deacons have expressed the same desire. Therefore, I accept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time I told them, &ldquo;First, I hope that there would not be any change in personnel in both the work and the service in the church. The elders will still be elders, the co-workers will still be co-workers, and the deacons will remain as deacons. The former practices, however, must all be stopped tonight and should exist no more. Starting tomorrow morning, all of the practices must be new. The first thing to be done is to set up the deacons&rsquo; office for the deacons to serve there. Everything is to be done in a new way; the old way definitely must not be used.&rdquo; Then I asked two sisters to be in the deacons&rsquo; office to establish principles for all the services. Due to the limitation in time, I intended to gradually rearrange the services of the elders and of the deacons, as well as the work of the co-workers.</p>
<p>Later two things happened. First, the senior co-worker who had represented all the co-workers in handing themselves over actually had not really handed himself over. Shortly after he did this, the two sisters that I had designated to be in charge of the deacons&rsquo; office told me that whenever I returned to Taiwan, that brother would come in to tell them to do differently from whatever I had arranged. I told them, &ldquo;It does not matter. While I am here, just do according to what I have arranged. When I am gone, if that brother does not want it, then just forget it.&rdquo; Therefore, there was a problem that occurred in 1961 in the church in Manila which did not happen suddenly. Instead, the cause had been hidden there from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Second, when I arrived in the Philippines in the spring of 1954, the elders came to meet with me. At that time one of the leading brothers said he realized that under my leadership the elders could no longer be elders in name only but had to give all of their strength and time. He felt that he could not give himself fully and that he also did not have the adequate time. Therefore, in the presence of everyone he wanted to resign his eldership. His word was very honest and very sincere. All of the other elders followed him, wanting to resign from the eldership. At this time the dissenting senior co-worker said that he too wanted to resign from the eldership and asked me to appoint some new elders. So I responded by saying that I needed to pray and seek the leading of the Lord and that before I appointed new elders, the original elders must continue their responsibilities.</p>
<p>After four weeks had passed, they urged me again and again to appoint the elders quickly. However, the more they urged me, the more I felt that I needed to slow down. During this period of seeking and waiting, I continually contacted the older saints, especially the serving sisters and the co-workers, inquiring about their feelings. They gave me their feelings as to which elders ought to remain in the eldership and which brothers should also be added as elders.</p>
<p>One afternoon, that dissenting senior co-worker came to the place where I lived and came directly into my room to urge me to get the matter of the eldership resolved. At that time, I sensed that he really did not want to give up his eldership but was merely trying to retreat in order to advance. He was trying to do this because in the past the elders had not always listened to him. He wanted me to make a new arrangement in the hope that I would openly declare him to be the number one elder. Then others would have to listen to him in the future. Because I had such a sense in my spirit, I immediately told him in all frankness not to try to use me. Then I went back to pray. I inwardly sensed the Lord telling me not to be maneuvered by others but to make the new and proper arrangements according to my real sense derived through the fellowship with all of the saints.</p>
 <p>After another week, the elders invited me to be with them, asking me what final decisions I had made. I then fellowshipped with them my feeling, saying, &ldquo;Of all the elders, only two will remain whereas another four new ones will be added.&rdquo; The ones retained did not include that senior co-worker; the ones added also did not include him. At that time whether they agreed or not, they had to comply because they had begged me to make the arrangements.</p>
<p>After the transfer of the eldership, something immediately happened to test the newly established elders. At that time there was a certain brother who was coming to Manila. Due to his relationship with the church in Manila in the early days, the brothers wondered whether they ought to invite him to preach the gospel. The two original elders did not necessarily agree with inviting him, but since they did not wish to offend him, they wanted to act in a diplomatic way. The four newly added elders, being serious in their undertaking, definitely did not agree. Unable to settle the issue among themselves, they came to ask me. I told them that I was not an elder in the church in Manila. The church in Manila had been given to the service of the six of them, so they should pray earnestly to see how things should be handled. This was their business; they had to make the decision before the Lord.</p>
<p>The original elders said that since this brother was a popular evangelist and the church in Manila needed to preach the gospel, it would be all right to invite him just to do the work of preaching the gospel. The new elders said that since this brother was not taking the same path as we were but was a traveling evangelist, it would not be proper to invite him to carry out his ministry. They also said that though the church needed to preach the gospel, the church more urgently needed the building up. For the building up of the church it would not be absolutely necessary to invite this brother to preach the gospel. Moreover, they felt that since the church in Manila had already been handed over to me to be built up under my leadership, they should set aside this matter for the time being. Since the original elders felt that they did not have a more convincing or stronger argument, they finally agreed not to invite this brother.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth, Life, the Church, and the Gospel-The Four Great Pillars in the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
