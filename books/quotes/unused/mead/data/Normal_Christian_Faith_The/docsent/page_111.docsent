   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING STONES FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are many big revelations in the book of Ephesians which relate to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter two we see one of them the church is the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What God has been desiring for a long time is a habitation, or a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapter two reveals that God's habitation is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church can be God's habitation because as individual Christians we are living stones 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if the living stones are not built up together, there is still no habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An individual Christian may not be a dead stone; he may be quite living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But he is only an isolated stone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is of no use in God's habitation; God can never dwell there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The new life within us urges us constantly to be built up with other stones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It will never be at ease or feel useful until we are built up into a spiritual house for God to dwell in. If we do not do this, we will feel that we are a piece of waste.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have to put myself into God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of me a gap is filled.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I am being built, I become part of the glory and majesty of this house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>MEMBERS OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 4 tells us that Christians are the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It also tells us that there is but "one Body."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is only one church in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Corinthians 12 says that "the body is one and has many members."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows us even more clearly that we cannot be isolated or independent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have been fully redeemed by the Lord and received the full grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no doubt that I am a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in this huge Body, I am just a member.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I may be a big member, a very useful one, yet I am still only a member.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am merely a part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I must depend on the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Together we become the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, my body has eyes, a mouth, hands, and feet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these are individual members.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My eyes are useful only when they are in my head.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I leave them at home, they will become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My hands can only function when they are attached to my arms.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If they are locked in a safe they are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The members can never be detached from the body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they are detached, they become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a very crucial relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only are the detached members useless, but they are ugly as well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If there was a human leg lying beneath this table, or if you picked up an arm on the road, how would you feel?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is impossible for you to be detached from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The members cannot be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They must be attached together.</S>
