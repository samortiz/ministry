   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. IN THE FALL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now go on to consider the believers life in the second stage in the stage of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A Life Mingled with the Devilish Life</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible reveals that due to the fall of man, besides the human life, there is also in man the life of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, Romans 7:18, 20 says that in man, that is, in the flesh of man, sin also dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sin here refers to the life of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This flesh, which contains the life of Satan, according to Galatians 5:17, continues to remain within man after he is saved, and often lusts against the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, after a person is saved, he still has Satan s life in him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Adam we all became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fall caused a great change in our life, for in the fall our life was mingled with the devilish life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Eve accepted the satanic proposal to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, Satan s element entered her soul and polluted it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the first result of the fall was that the soul of man was contaminated through Eve s receiving the Devil s thought and word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eve should not have spoken to the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While she was talking with him, his evil thought entered her mind and corrupted it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that even before she partook of the tree of knowledge, her mind had been polluted by the enemy s concept.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The satanic proposal poisoned man s soul, causing it to be mingled with the life of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, when Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, his body, as well as his soul, was poisoned by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then his spirit was deadened in the sense of being cut off from contact with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Due to the fall, man s mind and body were poisoned, and his spirit, the organ created for the purpose of contacting God and receiving Him, was deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the real picture of man s life in the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both God and Satan want man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God desires man for the accomplishment of His will, and Satan wants man for the fulfillment of his evil desire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The method of both Satan and God in gaining man is through life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s intention was for man to eat the fruit of the tree of life and thus obtain His uncreated life and be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, Satan enticed man to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thus causing man to obtain his fallen life and be mingled with him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan s life entered into him, causing him to become corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, besides his own original created life, man also obtained the fallen life of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After Adam sinned and fell, man not only offended God in behavior, which resulted in a sinful situation, but, worse still, he was poisoned by Satan in life, which caused his life to become defiled and corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Adam had not only disobeyed God s prohibition but also had taken Satan s life into himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Henceforth, man has become inwardly complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has the original upright and good life of man and also the evil and corrupted life of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan s life, filled as it is with all kinds of sins, contains the seed of all corruption and factors of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan lives within man and causes him to have lusts John 8:44 and commit sins 1 John 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, his life is the root of sins, which causes man to live out sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The various sins committed by man are derived from the life of Satan within him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ever since this devilish life entered into man, though at times he is still able to live out a little human goodness according to his human life, he lives out the devilish evils most of the time according to the devilish life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First John 3:8 says, He who practices sin is of the Devil, because the Devil sins from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man s fallen life is of the Devil, whose life is one of sin and who sins habitually from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sin is his nature, and sinning is his character.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First John 3:10a goes on to say, In this the children of God and the children of the Devil are manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To practice sin or not, that is, to live in sin or not, is not a matter of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is a matter of whose children we are the children of God or the children of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Men, as fallen descendants of Adam, are born children of the Devil, the evil one, possessing his life and living in sin automatically and habitually.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Practicing sin is their life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John 8:44 says, You are of your father the Devil, and it is your will to do the desires of your father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because truth is not in him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When he speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own self; for he is a liar and the father of it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because the Devil is the father of sinners, the sinners are children of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Devil is the old serpent Rev 12:9; 20:2 , and the sinners are also the serpents, the brood of vipers Matt 23:33; 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, they need the Lord Jesus to be lifted up for them in the form of the serpent on the cross John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Devil is the evil father who has brought forth sinful children.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These sinful children are all followers of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The evil life of the Devil, working as sin within man, enslaves man to sin.</S>
