   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The cross has to deal with our flesh, with our mentality, with our thinking, and with our likes and dislikes, that we may be fully walking by the Spirit who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 12:11 says we need to be "burning in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to be on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that first you are burned and then you burn others.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be on fire!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then you serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Apollos in Acts 18:24 is an example of this.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He knew the Bible, yet still he was not so clear about God's New Testament economy, about God's way.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>DEMONSTRATING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Corinthians 2:4 says that when Paul came to Corinth the first time his speech and preaching were "not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The apostle's speech and preaching were not from his mind with words of speculation, but from his spirit with the release and exhibition of the Spirit, hence of power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever we do, we have to demonstrate the Spirit, not our wisdom, eloquence, learning, or attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should demonstrate the Spirit through our spirit in a simple way.</S>
