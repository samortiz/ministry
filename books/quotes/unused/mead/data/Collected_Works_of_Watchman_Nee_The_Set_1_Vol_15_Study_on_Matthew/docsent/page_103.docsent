   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They thought that the four Gospels, the Acts, etc. were not written for the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scofield said that the Sermon on the Mount is exclusively for the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, he forgot Matthew 28:20: "Teaching them the nations to observe all that I have commanded you," and John 14:26: "And remind you of all the things which I have said to you."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They use only Paul's word as the ground of their teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But please read Colossians 3:16, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>F. "This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth...and then the end will come" Matt 24:14 . They say that there is a difference between the gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To them, the time to preach the gospel of the kingdom was restricted to the time the Lord was on the earth and to the time before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But our salvation is through the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They think that the gospel of grace does not need to be preached in all the world before one is raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The gospel of the kingdom of the heavens is equal to the gospel of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Acts 20:24-25 mentions the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word of the kingdom of God in verse 25 is the gospel of grace mentioned previously in verse 24.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Acts 1:3 the Lord was teaching concerning the things of the kingdom of God, which would come in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>G. These maintain that when Christ was on the earth, He was a minister to the circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is it not true that what He said was said against the background of the Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Surely, it was.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the age of grace began also with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Please see the following verses: Matthew 11:13-14; Luke 16:16, "from that time," that is, from Christ's time; Acts 10:36-37; Acts 13:25-27, "the word of this salvation" began from John's time; Mark 1:1, "the gospel of Jesus Christ" began from John the Baptist; and Luke 4:17-19, which records that the gospel of grace is "today...fulfilled" Luke 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 4:23 says that from the time of Jesus, another age began.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the age of the law man approached God in the flesh and by ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If anyone touched a carcass, he was unclean and had to offer sacrifices to God; these are the fleshly ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To come to God in the age of grace is to come in spirit and truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John 5:24-25 says, "And it is now."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two verses speak of the gospel of grace, which "is now."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>TO SHOW THAT THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>WILL PASS THROUGH THE TRIBULATION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We shall consider a few references:</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A. Second Thessalonians 2:1-9.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Read carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first verse is the subject: the coming of Christ and the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It does not speak only of Christ's coming; neither does it speak only of the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the rapture must be to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are hints to show that it will occur after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 2 the word "us" includes Paul, and the word "spirit" refers to another spirit, not the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"Word" means rumors.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"The day of the Lord" is the day of the Lord's coming and the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first school regards the day of the Lord as the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although the day of the Lord in the Old Testament always refers to the great tribulation, it is not necessarily so in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, in 2 Peter 3:10 the day of the Lord refers to the things after the great tribulation and after the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since this is so, we must look at the context.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First Thessalonians 2:1 very naturally refers to the second coming and the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time there were people who tried to deceive the Thessalonians by saying that the Lord had already come and that they were left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 3 "it" is "the day of the Lord," and "deceive" means to threaten or intimidate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before the rapture, however, there must be two signs: 1 the appearing of the man of lawlessness, the son of perdition, that is, the Antichrist, and 2 the falling away, or the apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that the man of lawlessness must be revealed before the rapture of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When will the man of lawlessness be revealed?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of course, he will be revealed during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, the rapture must be after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Based on this, at least a part of the church must pass through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>B. First Corinthians 15:50-55 and 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17: The first passage refers to the resurrection and the transfiguration; the second passage refers to the resurrection and the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These two sections are parallel sections.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everyone agrees that the things mentioned in these passages occur at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Are there any hints that point to the time?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is the blowing of the last trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We know this must be after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The first school says that the last trumpet is blown before the tribulation, but there is no ground for this, not even one verse in the Bible that shows this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The blowing of the last trumpet will take place after the tribulation; this last trumpet is the seventh trumpet of the seven trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the last trumpet was blown before the tribulation, this would be absurd because there would then be seven more trumpets after the last trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is like saying that after the last son there remain seven more sons.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Mr. Janning ? and others say that the trumpet here refers to the church's trumpet, not the trumpet of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Where does the Bible mention anything about the first or the last trumpet of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some among the Brethren say that this refers to the last trumpet in Roman military terminology, which was sounded before the whole legion marched, and that Paul borrowed it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But the Holy Spirit does not borrow from the Roman military terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Also, this is God's trumpet and not the church's trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Certainly this is the last trumpet of the seven trumpets in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Moreover in Revelation 10:7, when the seventh trumpet is sounded, God's mystery is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This mystery refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>C. Miscellaneous evidences: 1 The consummation of the age: Matthew 24:3; 13:40; 28:20; "the age" equals aeon.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The great tribulation is at the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If the rapture occurs before the tribulation, then this age will be three and a half years short.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>2 The putting of the enemies under Christ's feet: 1 Corinthians 15:25; Acts 2:35.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This event actually occurs after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>First Timothy 6:14 says, "Keep...until after the tribulation the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In Revelation no verse indicates that the Lord will leave the throne to come to the air before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is only after the tribulation begins that He leaves the throne Rev 14:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If Christ will come to the air before the tribulation, then we do not need to wait, be sober, and be watchful.</S>
