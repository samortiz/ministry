   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING WHO HE IS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet" v. 19 . Because Christ told her everything that she ever did, she perceived that this was no ordinary man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He must be a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jesus said something more to show her that He was not merely a prophet: "Believe Me" v. 21 . The woman said, "I know that Messiah is coming He who is called Christ ; when He comes, He will declare all things to us" v. 25 . What did Jesus answer her? He said, "I, who speak to you, am He" v. 26 . The first thing that a sinner needs to do is not to repent and change his behavior, but to realize who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All will be well if he realizes who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later the woman returned to the city and told the people, "Come, see a man who told me all that I have done.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is this not the Christ?" v. 29 . I do not like the words, "Is this not." Since she knew that this man was the Christ, why did she say, "Is this not"? At any rate, she believed and went to tell others that Christ had come.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You can see clearly that the whole issue is not about doctrine but about a person!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our basic concern is not doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, it is seeing who Jesus is!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once we have the Lord Jesus, we will have real satisfaction; we will be filled with the sense of having acquired everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will see a little more from John 5.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems that in chapter five the Lord Jesus spoke some doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But actually not much was expounded.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was once again an invitation to receive the knowledge of who Jesus of Nazareth is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He spoke some words, but they were to lead us to believe into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus said that the Jews searched the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Scriptures, the Lord pointed out, are a witness to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is written there concerns Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is important to know the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But more important than that is the knowledge of who Jesus of Nazareth is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The question is not what kind of teaching He teaches, but what kind of a person He is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I AM</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we come to John 6, the matter is brought out in an even clearer way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst" v. 35 . He did not preach any doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He just said, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Have you seen the implication here?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If I say that I am your bread of life and that he who eats me shall never hunger, you will surely say that Mr. Nee is a madman from Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Religious leaders can only give doctrines to others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They cannot give themselves to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But Jesus is different.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is also the thirst-quenching water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem is in the people's unbelief in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When anyone believes in Him, everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"I am the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>48-50 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These are words that no other can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only Jesus can say this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is neither a madman nor a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And whatever He says always points back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This man is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He who eats of Him shall not die!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, our Christian faith is based on the issue of who Jesus of Nazareth is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not spending time merely to study His teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are only asked to answer one question: who is He?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What Christ proclaimed persistently on the earth was not His doctrines but Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The focus is not on the doctrines but on the person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As far as doctrines go, the books of Confucius and Mencius are filled with philosophies, ethics, and morality; they far exceed those in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But there is only one issue: who is Jesus of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do you know?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Who is this Jesus of Nazareth?</S>
