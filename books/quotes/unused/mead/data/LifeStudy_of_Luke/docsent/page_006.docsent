   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHRIST WHO LIVES IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today the very Christ who lives in us is still the One who possesses the human virtues strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While He was on earth, He lived a life in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such a life was a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, the Lord Jesus lived this kind of life outside the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But from the time of His resurrection He has been living this kind of life within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that within us today the Man-Savior is still living a life in the highest standard of morality, a life that is a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we see this, we shall say with Paul, It is no longer I, but Christ lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Have you ever realized that the Christ who lives in you is a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kind of life He lived on earth He is now seeking to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE VIEW OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>AND HIS SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have seen that the Lord spoke in parables to illustrate a life in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have also seen this life displayed in different gospel cases.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose you had been the criminal who asked the Lord to save him, and He immediately gave you more than you had asked without any terms or conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps you would say, Oh, what love this is!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, it is not adequate to call this love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose you had been the one wounded by robbers and left to die without anyone to care for you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then this good Samaritan came, was moved with compassion, and did everything necessary to save you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This also is something more than love it is the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that we all shall see this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The subject of the Gospel of Luke is the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have this view in our reading of this Gospel, it will become a new book to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we read chapter after chapter of the Gospel of Luke, we need to have the view of the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>CONTENTS Presenting the Savior</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>as a Genuine, Moral, and Perfect Man</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Gospel of Luke presents the Savior as a genuine, moral, and perfect Man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This Man revealed God among men in His saving grace to fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I like the expression saving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Gospel of Luke God is revealed in a Man who saves sinners by His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this book we have a picture of a Man who is genuine, moral, and perfect, a Man who reveals God in His saving grace to fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This Man did not reveal Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, He revealed God in His saving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Impressing Us with the Completeness</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>and Perfection of the Man-Savior s Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The contents of the Gospel of Luke impress us with the completeness and perfection of the Man-Savior s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we read this Gospel, the more we are impressed that it is the record of a Man, a full, whole, complete, perfect, and real Man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this Man God is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, this Man is God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In all He did and said, He was a genuine, complete, moral, and perfect Man who revealed not Himself, but God primarily in the aspect of His saving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not Emphasizing the Dispensational Aspect</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>or the Jewish Background</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The contents of this Gospel do not emphasize the dispensational aspect or the Jewish background.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is in contrast to the Gospel of Matthew, which does stress both the dispensational aspect and the Jewish background.</S>
