   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SOLVING ALL OUR PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many of our problems can be solved by taking Christ as the solution to our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Often when people come to talk to me, they tell me only the negative side of their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some have come to me, saying, Brother Lee, I cannot control my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I lose my temper so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Others have told me, Brother Lee, my experience with the Lord is not very stable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes I am very much with the Lord, but later I fall away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No doubt it is difficult to overcome sin, give up the world, and forsake the worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are many matters like these on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, I have discovered that there is no need to talk about these negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have pointed this out to many of the Lord s children, saying, Brothers and sisters, forget about the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us go on positively by taking Christ, experiencing Christ, applying Christ, and exercising to appropriate Christ moment by moment in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not eat and drink enough, we may eventually be infected with germs and may cause ourselves much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, instead of paying attention to the germs on the negative side, we should forget about them and focus on eating and drinking properly on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then all the negative troubles will be solved by our positive enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must enjoy Christ in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is strange that although we have such a rich supply, most of the time we do not enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, we spend our time and energy trying to deal with the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have met many sisters who told me that they were very frustrated because they were unable to be patient with their children or their husband.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I told them that there was no need for them to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you realize that the Lord is not asking us to be patient?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, He is asking us to enjoy Him and apply Him in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we take Christ as our life and eat and drink Him, we will realize that it is easy to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may even be patient without knowing it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is our understanding and our wisdom 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is our release and our limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is our kingdom, our home, and our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is a sphere and a realm to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Day by day we are walking in Christ Col 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, we must not be satisfied with simply knowing these things as doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do we truly know how to enjoy Christ as our daily bread and our living water?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do we have the experience of appropriating Christ in all our daily affairs?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do we truly realize that Christ is our dwelling place, our way, our clothing, our rest, our joy, and our wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the problem with most Christians today; they have many teachings but too little experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today there are many doctrines and teachings among the Lord s children, yet when you ask them how to experience Christ in a real way, very few are able to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am very burdened by this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is such an urgent need that the Lord s children know Christ in a practical and experiential way, not a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In these messages I am not teaching mere doctrine, because many of us may know that Christ is our life, the bread of life, the living water, and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What I am pointing out is our need for practical experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to ask ourselves how much we experience Christ in our daily living and apply Him in our daily situations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord told us that He is the bread of life and the living water John 6:48; 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Bread and water are simple matters, but they are also very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not take these things as mere doctrines; rather, we should practice them day by day in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is to be a real Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A Christian is one who enjoys and applies Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope that we all would spend some time to consider this matter and to tell the Lord, Lord, I realize that You are everything to me, but I want to prove this in my daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I do not want to tell people what You are by merely giving them teachings and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I want to be able to testify how You are everything to me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I want to apply You to all the affairs in my daily life moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE WAY TO APPLY CHRIST AS OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are going to apply Christ as our life, we must know what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When some people heard that Christ was the bread of life and that He could be their food, they said, This word is hard; who can hear it?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>6:60 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They could not understand how this man could give Himself as bread to them and be eaten by them, so they left Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, the Lord told the disciples, It is the Spirit who gives life;...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life v. 63 . In order to apply Christ as our life, we must understand the relationship between the word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have the written Word, the Bible, in our hand and Christ as the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, we have the Holy Scriptures outwardly and the Holy Spirit inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever we contact the written Word not merely with our mind but with our spirit, the word spoken to us by the Lord becomes the Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Outwardly, the written Word is still the Word, but when we receive the written Word with our spirit, the word received by us becomes the Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we speak what we have received to someone else, the Spirit in us becomes the word again, and when that person receives the word, the word becomes the Spirit in him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must always contact the Word by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we contact the Word with our spirit, we receive the word, and the word becomes the Spirit in us Eph 6:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because this very Spirit is life to us, we feel living, refreshed, satisfied, and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We sense that we are alive because we have the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This life also becomes light to us John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because we not only have the life but are also in the light, we sense that we are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we have the word, we have the Spirit; when we have the Spirit, we enjoy life; and when we enjoy life, we experience the light.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the way to walk in Christ, live by Christ, and apply Christ in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must not merely listen to messages and learn doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Instead, we must learn how to contact the written Word with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we contact the Word with our spirit, we receive the word into us, and the word becomes the living Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This living Spirit then becomes life to us, and we sense that we are satisfied, strengthened, refreshed, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We also sense that our whole being is in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christ is a sphere, a realm, in which we can walk, live, work, and have our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this realm we can experience and enjoy Christ as the allotted portion of the saints in the light Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This light is a sphere or realm, just as darkness is also a sphere or realm.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This light is a kingdom of light; when we walk within this kingdom of light, we are controlled and ruled by the light.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This light is the life, this life is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Thus, we must take Christ as the living word.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we take the word, it becomes the Spirit within us, and this very Spirit is the life supply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As we enjoy the life supply, the life becomes light to us a realm, sphere, and kingdom of light in which we may walk, work, and live.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We need to realize our need to apply Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We need to practice contacting Christ and applying Christ day by day and moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we are going to be real Christians, we must exercise to experience, apply, appropriate, and enjoy Christ as our spiritual portion all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we have this kind of experience, we will become the increase of Christ, and when we become the increase of Christ, we will see the oneness of the increase of Christ John 3:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the Gospel of John there are three main points life, the increase, and the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Christ as the embodiment of God is life to us, and when we enjoy and experience Him as our life, we become His increase, which must be one.</S>
