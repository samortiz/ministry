In order to coordinate with other Christians, we need to pass through the experience of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum to become living creatures bearing a human image and, in the grace of the Lord, manifesting Christ in four aspects as a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. Having the wings of an eagle, we must deny the self and rely on the grace and power of God. We also need the man&rsquo;s hands and the calf&rsquo;s hoofs. These are the prerequisites of coordination.</p><p>Suppose a certain person has not passed through the experience of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, yet he is a nominal Christian. Such a person cannot participate in the coordination of the four living creatures.</p><h2 class="head2">Allowing the Lord to Continue His Work on Us and Experiencing the Dealing of the Cross</h2><p>Suppose another person, a genuine believer in Christ, has experienced the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum and thus has become a living creature. However, he is not willing to allow the Lord to continue His work on him. As a result, he does not manifest the expression of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle, and therefore he cannot coordinate with others for God&rsquo;s expression, move, and administration. Because he stays in himself and because he expresses himself in every word and action, it is impossible for him to coordinate with others.</p><p>We should not think that it is easy for us to express, to live out, the faces of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. This requires much experience of the dealing of the cross. Today, although many brothers and sisters have passed through the experience of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, they are not willing to allow the cross to work in them. Therefore, they do not have the expression of the four living creatures.</p><p>Instead of having the expression of an eagle in their daily living, some believers may have the expression of a creeping thing. Ephesians 4:26 says, &ldquo;Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation.&rdquo; To be angry is not a sin, but with it there is the possibility of committing sin. We should not continue in anger but should relinquish it before the sun sets. However, when certain brothers and sisters get angry, they do not let go of it. Because they do not overcome their anger and do not let it go, they have the expression of a creeping thing, not of an eagle.</p><p>The situation is the same with believers who are unwilling to forgive those who have offended them. Once certain brothers and sisters are offended by what is spoken to them or what is spoken concerning them, they will refuse to forgive that offense. They may go through their whole life without forgiving the ones who have offended them. Believers who lack the willingness to forgive offenses surely do not have the eagle&rsquo;s wings, and they certainly cannot coordinate with other saints. Those who do not accept the dealing of the cross and enjoy grace are not able to share in the coordination of the four living creatures.</p><p>There are some brothers and sisters who are reluctant to part with and forget such things as their education, money, and career. Therefore, they also have the expression not of an eagle but of a creeping thing. However, one who enjoys grace will count his career or education as loss (Phil. 3:7). Even if he has a doctoral degree, he will count it as refuse (v. 8). Because he is willing to receive the dealing of the cross and because he enjoys grace, he has the eagle&rsquo;s wings and he can coordinate with others.</p><p>Brothers and sisters who do not understand God&rsquo;s grace and power but do everything in themselves and with their cleverness and natural ability cannot coordinate with others. Those who can coordinate are those who deny themselves, reject themselves, regard themselves as nothing, and trust in God&rsquo;s grace, power, and work in everything and for everything. These ones can easily coordinate with others. Actually, there is no need for them to endeavor to coordinate; they coordinate spontaneously and effortlessly because they are in God, not in themselves. Those who are in themselves cannot coordinate, but those who are in God can coordinate with ease.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
