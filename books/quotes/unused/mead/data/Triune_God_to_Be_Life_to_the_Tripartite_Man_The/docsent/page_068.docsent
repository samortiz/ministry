   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WE CHRISTIANS LIVING IN RESURRECTION,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT BY OURSELVES BUT BY CHRIST REPLACING US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We live in resurrection, not by ourselves but by Christ replacing us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have been "fired," that is, we have been removed from our former post and replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are in the transit of Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are always in transit from death to resurrection; we are living to die.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To live to die is to go through death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To die to live is to remain in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then while remaining in resurrection, we live to die.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The secret to this experience of living to die and dying to live is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's economy according to the divine revelation in the holy Word is to get the new creation out of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way God gains the new creation is to first put the old creation to death, that is, to terminate the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then God injects Himself into this terminated old creation in order to gain the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without the injection of the divine element into God's creation, God has no way to get the new creation out of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As Christians, we are God's new creation 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On one side of the cross, we were the old creation, but on the other side of the cross, we are the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On one side of the cross, the old creation was terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the other side of the cross, the divine element has come in to enliven the old creation, making it the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The old creation, after being terminated and injected with the divine element, came out of death into resurrection as the new creation with the divine element within it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The new creation is in a new condition with the divine element within it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The point of transit is the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ's death together with His resurrection is a big place of transit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we are still in the transit of Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All day long we are dying to live and living to die.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The cross is the center of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every day, every moment, we have to go to the cross and remain on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Often we leave the place of transit, but we have to come back again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are living to die and dying to live.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Living to die is to enter into death, and dying to live is to leave death to enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a part of God's old creation, we have been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now as Christians we are in the transit of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, we live to die in Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Christ's death does not leave us in death; His death brings us into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, we die to live.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are brought into a cycle of living to die and of dying to live.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Christ's death we live to die, and in His resurrection we die to live.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ Himself was born to die.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then He came forth from death in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He died in order to live.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As Christians we follow the same course.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We were regenerated to die, and this death brings us into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, we live to die and we die to live.</S>
