   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT IS RESURRECTION?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now my question is: What is resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Resurrection is everything that is not out of our natural life, not out of ourselves, and not based on our ability.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Resurrection speaks of the things that are beyond us, which we cannot do in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Any rod can be engraved with flowers or painted with colors, but no one can make it bud.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have never heard of a rod which can still bud and blossom after being used for decades.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No woman in the world has ever given birth after her womb has been closed, but Sarah bore Isaac Rom 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was God's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, Sarah typifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Resurrection means that one cannot do anything by himself, that he can only do it through God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It means that it is not by oneself, but by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Resurrection means that one ignores what he is and trusts only in what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It matters little whether or not you are smarter than others or more eloquent than others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you have any spirituality, this spirituality is not based on yourself, but on God's work in you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose Aaron had been foolish enough to say to others, "My rod is different from your rod.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My rod is smoother, brighter, and straighter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why it budded."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How foolish and silly that would have been!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we think for a moment that we are different from others, that is the most foolish thought.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if there is something different in us, it is the result of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Resurrection means that everything is out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The name Isaac means "laughter.''</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why did Abraham call his son "laughter"?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He called him Isaac for two reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, God promised Abraham that Sarah would give birth to a son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Sarah heard, she laughed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was natural for her to laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When she looked at herself, she could not help but laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Her time of childbearing was past, and her womb was closed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How could she ever bear a child?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She thought that this was impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, when God told Abraham that she would have a child, she laughed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second, when Sarah brought forth a son a year later, she was indeed laughing for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, God called the child's name Isaac Gen 18:10-15; 21:1-3, 6-7 , which means "laughter."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first time she laughed because of the impossibility of the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The second time she laughed because she discovered to her surprise that it was possible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a man has never experienced the first laughing, he can never experience the second laughing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a man has never realized his own inability, he can never experience God's ability.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sarah knew herself; she had full knowledge of herself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She knew that she could not make it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But as soon as she looked to God's work, she was able to laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Resurrection means that God has given us something that we did not have in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible testifies again and again that man cannot make it by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But many people think that they can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the matter of service, if some would truly laugh at themselves, saying, "I cannot make it," they would find themselves laughing again, saying, "I did not make it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have seen through myself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord has made it for me."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If there is any manifestation of authority in us, we should say to the Lord, "You are the One who has done it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is none of my business."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Resurrection means that you cannot make it and that God is the One who has done everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>RESURRECTION BEING THE ETERNAL PRINCIPLE OF SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The principle to every service lies in the budding rod.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God returned all the eleven rods to the leaders, but kept Aaron's rod inside the ark as an eternal memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This means that resurrection is an eternal principle in our service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A servant of the Lord is one who has died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God testifies again and again to His people that authority to serve God lies in resurrection, not in a person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All services to the Lord must pass through death and resurrection before they will be acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Resurrection means that everything is of God and not of us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It means that God alone is able and that we are not able.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Resurrection means that everything is done by God, not by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All those who think highly of themselves and who hold a misguided judgment of themselves have never realized what resurrection is.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No one should be mistaken to think that he can do anything by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If a man continues to think that he is able, that he can do something, and that he is useful, he does not know resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He may know the doctrine of resurrection, the reason for resurrection, or the result of resurrection, but he does not know resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All those who know resurrection have given up hope in themselves; they know that they cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As long as the natural strength remains, the power of resurrection has no ground for manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As long as Sarah could beget a child, Isaac would not come.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What we can do belongs to the natural realm, and what is impossible for us to do belongs to the realm of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's ability is not manifested in His creation but in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God's greatest power is manifested not through creation but through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When God's power is manifested in creation, it does not need to be preceded by death.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But when His power is manifested in resurrection, there is the need for it to be preceded by death.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Every created thing needs no precedence for its creation, but everything in resurrection has its precedence.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If a man can survive by what he possessed in the first place, he has not experienced any resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If a man's ability is according to what he had in the first place, he does not have resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If he is what he was in the first place, he does not have resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If what he has is what he possessed in the first place, he does not have resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must acknowledge that we can do nothing, are nothing, and have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We are like a dead dog.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we acknowledge this, and we find that something is still alive in us, that is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Creation does not require the knowledge of death, but resurrection requires that we fall down, prostrate before God, and confess to Him, "I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I am nothing, and I have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If I can give anything to others, it is because You have given it to me.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If I can do anything, it is because You have done it through me."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Once we prostrate before the Lord in this way, everything we have will become God's work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Henceforth, we will never be mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We will realize that everything that is dead belongs to us and everything that is living belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have to separate ourselves from the Lord clearly; everything that has to do with death belongs to us, and everything that has to do with life belongs to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord is never confused, but we are often confused.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>A man must come to the end of himself before he will be convinced of his utter uselessness.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>After Sarah gave birth to Isaac, she would never be foolish enough to think that her own strength was responsible for it.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The colt would not be mistaken to think that the hosannas were directed at it.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God has to bring us to the point where we will no longer be confused about what is of God and what is of us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Everyone who is an authority should know this; he should not be mistaken in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>There must be no misunderstanding with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Authority is of God and not of us; we are only those who keep custody of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Only those who have seen this are qualified to be a deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Brothers and sisters, when you set out for your work, I hope that none of you would be foolish enough to think that you have any authority in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>As soon as you offend the principle of resurrection, you lose authority, and as soon as you try to exhibit your authority, you instantly lose authority.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>A dry rod can exhibit nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But when you have resurrection, you have authority, because authority rests with resurrection, not with the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Everything that we have is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Hence authority does not rest in us but in the Lord.</S>
