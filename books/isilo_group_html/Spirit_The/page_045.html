<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being the Essence<br />
of Christ&rsquo;s Divine Being</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the essence of Christ&rsquo;s divine being. In Romans 1:3-4 Paul said that Christ &ldquo;came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, and was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.&rdquo; According to the flesh, Christ came out of the seed of David. But according to the Spirit of holiness, He was designated the Son of God in resurrection. The Spirit of holiness here is in contrast with Christ&rsquo;s flesh. As the flesh refers to the human essence of Christ, the Spirit of holiness refers to the divine essence of Christ. The Spirit of holiness is the very essence of Christ&rsquo;s divine person, His divine being.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being the Realization of Christ</h2>
<p>John 14:16-20 presents a revelation of the Spirit as the realization of Christ. The Lord said that He would pray to the Father to give the disciples another Comforter, and this other Comforter is the Spirit of reality. Eventually, this Spirit of reality is the realization of Christ. After His resurrection, the Lord as the Spirit lives in His disciples that they may live Him (v. 19). He told the disciples that in the day of resurrection, they would know that He was in the Father, that they were in Him, and that He was in them.</p>
<p>In John 14:16-20 the Triune God is greatly defined. The Lord&rsquo;s word here covers the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in a way to help us see that the Spirit of reality is the realization of Christ. Christ the Son is the Father&rsquo;s embodiment, and the Spirit is the Son&rsquo;s realization. In other words, the Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being the Reality of Christ</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the reality of Christ. The Spirit is the realization of the Son because the Spirit is the reality of the Son. First John 5:6b says, &ldquo;The Spirit is the truth.&rdquo; The truth is the reality, and the reality is Christ. The Spirit who is the truth, the reality (John 14:16-17; 15:26), testifies that Jesus is the Son of God, in whom is the eternal life. By thus testifying, He imparts the Son of God into us to be our life (Col. 3:4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being the Witness of Christ</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the witness of Christ (John 15:26; 1 John 5:6-7). Whatever the Father is and has is the Son&rsquo;s, whatever the Son is and has is received by the Spirit, and the Spirit discloses to us all that He receives (John 16:13-15). This means that the Spirit is the witness of Christ. All the riches of the Triune God reach us in the Spirit. Therefore, everything of the Triune God is ours. Whenever the Spirit speaks, He speaks Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. He speaks all of what Christ is and has. This is a kind of witnessing. The Spirit witnesses Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being<br />
Christ as the Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>The Spirit is Christ as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In redeeming us on the cross, He was Jesus in the flesh. But in giving life to us, He is the life-giving Spirit. As the Lamb, He redeemed us on the cross. As the life-giving Spirit, He gives us life within.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being Christ as the Lord&mdash;<br />
the Lord Spirit</h2>
<p>The Spirit is Christ as the Lord&mdash;the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17-18). The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ. This expression strongly proves and confirms that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ. Christ is the Lamb, the life-giving Spirit, and eventually, the Lord Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being Christ as Life to Man</h2>
<p>The Spirit is Christ as life to man (Rom. 8:2). The New Testament reveals that Christ is life (John 11:25), even our life (Col. 3:4). However, Christ can be life to us only in the reality of the Spirit. Hence, it is actually the Spirit of life who is life to God&rsquo;s chosen people. The Triune God as the Spirit of life makes sinners into sons of God who become the living members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>According to the New Testament revelation, the Spirit of God is the very essence of both God and Christ. This Spirit, as the essence of God and Christ, is God&rsquo;s reaching of man and Christ&rsquo;s realization to us. It is through this Spirit that we receive God. It is also by the Spirit that we realize Christ. Hence, our experience of God and of Christ is altogether a matter of this Spirit. Such a Spirit today is dwelling in our spirit. So we have to learn how to exercise our spirit that the Spirit within our spirit may be able to make God and Christ real to us for our experience and enjoyment.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Spirit &nbsp; pg 45</div><br></body></html>
