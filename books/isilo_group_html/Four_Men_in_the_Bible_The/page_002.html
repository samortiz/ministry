<h1 class="title">THE FOUR MEN IN THE BIBLE&mdash;<br />
ADAM, CHRIST, THE NEW MAN,<br />
AND THE MAN-CHILD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 8, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:45, 47; Eph. 2:15; Rev. 12:5; Gen. 1:26; Matt. 18:3; Gen. 2:7-9; Prov. 20:27; Job 32:8; John 4:24; 2 Cor. 4:6</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING A BOOK ON MAN</h2>
<p>The Bible is rich and all-inclusive. Some say that the Bible is a book on God, and this is true. But if we read the Bible carefully, we will see that the Bible is also a book on man. The Bible speaks very clearly and accurately about man. Numerous books have been written about the origin of man, but most of these writings are merely doctrines and theories. Based on Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution, for example, many people believe that man evolved from apes and monkeys. The theory of evolution, however, is an unverified deduction that does not explain the real origin of man. There was even a report that Darwin expressed regret on his deathbed for advocating the theory of evolution and that he repented to believe in the true God who created all things. The only book in the whole world that thoroughly and accurately explains man is the Bible. If we want to know man, that is, to know ourselves, we must know the Bible. The Bible is a book about man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN</h2>
<p>Although the Bible speaks of countless men, in one sense it speaks only of four men. The Bible begins by speaking of Adam. According to the revelation of the Scriptures, Adam is the first man, and the Lord Jesus is the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45). The first man is Adam, and the last Adam, who is also the second man, is the Lord Jesus (v. 47). <em>The second man</em> is an expression full of significance. Adam is the first man, and the Lord Jesus is the second man. Hence, in God&rsquo;s eyes there are only two men, Adam and the Lord Jesus; there are no other men in between these two.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that all men are in Adam and that all men are a part of Adam. Hence, even though many men were born between Adam and the Lord Jesus, such as Cain, Abel, Enosh, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Solomon, Jeremiah, and many others, they all were part of Adam, the first man. This is like our arms, hands, ears, and eyes being a part of us. Because we all are descendants of Adam and issued out from him, we all have the same surname.</p>
<p>The first man is Adam; the second man is Christ. The third man is the new man in Ephesians. Verse 15 of chapter 2 says, &ldquo;That He might create the two in Himself into one new man.&rdquo; This new man is the church. Thus, there are the first man, the second man, and the third man, which is the new man. The Old Testament is the history of the first man, the Gospels in the New Testament are the biography of the second man, and Acts to Revelation contain the history of the third man, the church, as the one new man. Revelation 12:5 speaks of the fourth man, the man-child. The last book of the Bible can be considered as the biography of the fourth man, the man-child.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD CALLING YOUNG MEN</h2>
<p>The first man, Adam, was created by God in His image so that God could be expressed through man (Gen. 1:26). This speaks of the purpose of man&rsquo;s creation. Furthermore, if we want to be used by God to express Him, we must be young men, not old men. The older saints may feel disappointed when they hear this word, but I have spent much time in the Bible, and it is hard to find a verse that speaks of God calling someone who was old. If you say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you are old,&rdquo; I would say, &ldquo;I am not old; I am younger than you.&rdquo; The Bible&rsquo;s definition of young and old is not based on age. The Lord said, &ldquo;Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 18:3). We should become like little children because a child is not preoccupied; he is completely &ldquo;blank.&rdquo; He is not subjective, nor does he have opinions, biases, or old doctrines. This is the meaning of being young in the Bible.</p>
<p>An old person is full of opinions, feelings, and biases. This is the reason that it is difficult to handle elderly persons who are over fifty years old. When they are asked a question, they are full of opinions, biases, assertions, and prejudices. When an old person hears a word about loving the Lord, he will say, &ldquo;It is not enough merely to love the Lord. There must also be actions that demonstrate our love.&rdquo; If we say, &ldquo;That is right; there also must be actions that demonstrate our love,&rdquo; he will say, &ldquo;But not all actions are worthwhile.&rdquo; It seems as if nothing can satisfy an old person who is like this. When we speak of one matter, he will speak of another, and when we speak of that matter, he will speak of yet another matter.</p>
<p>Some still may wish to argue with me, saying, &ldquo;When the Lord Jesus was born, the elderly Simeon and the elderly Anna were in the temple.&rdquo; Indeed, these two feared the Lord very much and were very spiritual (Luke 2:25-38). But when the Lord Jesus called His disciples, He did not go to the temple and ask, &ldquo;Where is Simeon?&rdquo; Neither did He say, &ldquo;Simeon&rsquo;s experience will be very useful. I wish to invite him to come with Me.&rdquo; When the Lord Jesus came, He was a young man, fresh and new, without any old concepts. What would have happened if the Lord Jesus had said to Simeon and Anna, &ldquo;Follow Me. Let us go fishing by the sea&rdquo;? Simeon may have said, &ldquo;Lord, I only know how to pray; I do not know how to fish,&rdquo; and Anna may have said, &ldquo;Lord, I have never left the temple; I cannot go with You.&rdquo; With such responses, the Lord would have been unable to go on. Hence, the Lord Jesus did not call those who were old to follow Him.</p>
<p>When the Lord called James and John, He did not call their father Zebedee. The Lord called only his young sons to follow Him. When He called, they left their father and followed Him (Matt. 4:21-22). The Lord did not call old people in the temple, nor did He call old people by the sea. The Lord called young people, because young people do not have so many opinions or prejudices. Those with opinions and prejudices are old; those without opinions and prejudices are young. All those with opinions, prejudices, and biases are old, and the Lord cannot call them.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Four Men in the Bible &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
