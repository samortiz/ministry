   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Passing through Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we take a rib out of the human body, the rib will surely die.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the day of the Lord s resurrection, His disciples became His brothers, and all those who believed into Him received His life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The producing of Eve was through the rib that God took from Adam s side, typifying that the church is produced through the three steps that Christ passed through incarnation, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Nature of the Church Christ</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as the nature of Eve is Adam, so also the nature of the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eve was built from a part taken out of Adam s body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, her nature was not only the same as that of Adam; she was Adam.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before Adam fell into a deep sleep, he was alone, but when he woke up, Eve was there.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus is called Christ, and the believers are called Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The two, Christ and the Christians, are not only similar; they are one and are out of the same source.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eve was Adam, and the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the nature of the church, and the church is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anything short of Christ is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever is not Christ is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Corinthians 12:12 says, For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this verse the body refers to the church, but the following words, so also is the Christ, show that the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Issue</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Being Joined to Christ and</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Returning to Christ</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The issue of the church being produced is that the church is joined to Christ and will return to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is typified by Eve and Adam becoming one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eve came out of Adam and returned to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After Eve came out of Adam, she and Adam did not become two.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Genesis 2:23, regarding Eve, Adam said, This time this is bone of my bones / And flesh of my flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 24 the two became one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eve came out of Adam, and she returned to Adam and became one with him.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rebekah typifies the church being chosen from the world Gen 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After Eve, Rebekah is the second Old Testament type regarding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sarah does not typify the church because Abraham is not a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In his person, Abraham typifies God the Father, and in reference to doctrine, Abraham typifies justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, Sarah typifies grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In reference to Sarah as a type of grace, Galatians 4:26 says, The Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The principal reason that Rebekah typifies the church is that her husband, Isaac, typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In regard to person, Isaac typifies God the Son the Son of God , and in regard to doctrine, Isaac typifies the inheritance in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rebekah as a type of the church has an altogether different focus than Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a type of the church, Eve depicts the producing of the church and the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a type of the church, Rebekah depicts the church being chosen out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This type includes the choosing of the Father and the calling and leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Holy Spirit led Rebekah step by step through a long journey to Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, this picture of Rebekah being a type of the church depicts how the church was chosen out of the world and brought all the way into the heavenly tabernacle to enjoy Christ s love and to satisfy Him.</S>
