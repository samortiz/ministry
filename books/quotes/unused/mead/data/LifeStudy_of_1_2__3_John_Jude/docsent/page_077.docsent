   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ANOINTED ONE, THE ANOINTING ONE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To deny that Jesus is the Christ is related to denying the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, due to the problem of language, we may not realize that Christ is related to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word for Christ is Christos, which means the anointed one, and the Greek word for anointing is chrisma.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both words are derived from the same root.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we must go on to see that Christ as the anointed One becomes the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because He is the anointed One, He has an abundance of ointment with which to anoint us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, the anointed One becomes the anointing One.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In fact, He even becomes the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny that Jesus is the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, to deny the anointed One means to deny the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, to deny the Christos is to deny the chrisma.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever someone denies that Jesus is the Christos, that one denies that Jesus is the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is equal to denying the anointing, for after the anointed One enters into us, He becomes the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul says, But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ has been anointed with the divine ointment, and the ointment that is upon Him now flows to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is pictured in Psalm 133, which says that the anointing oil flows from the head of Aaron to his beard and even to the skirts of his priestly robe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that Christ has an abundance of the anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has poured the ointment upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through that anointing Christ has received the ointment, and eventually He, the anointed One, became the anointing One.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When He entered into us as the anointed One, He became the anointing One in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, the anointing that dwells in us is the anointed One becoming the anointing One and also the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To reject this anointed One is to reject the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever someone denies that Jesus is the anointed One and thereby denies that He is the anointing One, this person also denies the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we need to see that to deny the anointing is to be anti-anointing, the accurate meaning of the title antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Antichrist, therefore, means anti the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to verse 22, the antichrist is the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny that He is the anointing One.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is also to deny the anointing and thereby to be anti-anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is the antichrist?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The antichrist is someone who is anti-anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, according to verse 22, to be an antichrist, to be anti-anointing, is to deny the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may not be anti the anointing in this way, yet we have to admit that often we disobey this inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s intention is to work Himself into us as our life and our everything to make us His counterpart for the expression of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to accomplish this, it was necessary for God to pass through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He entered into resurrection, He became the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Spirit is actually Christos, the anointed One, becoming the life-giving One.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The One we received is the anointed One, who through death and resurrection has become the anointing One.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, this anointing One is the all-inclusive indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As soon as we believed in Him, He as the Spirit entered our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now He is within our spirit to anoint us, to paint us, with the element of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more this painting goes on, the more the element of the Triune God is transfused into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the anointing, which is the reality of the entire New Testament.</S>
