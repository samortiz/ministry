   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord's Table Being a Weekly Feast</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's table is also a feast to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Week by week as we come to the Lord's table, we have a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past when I attended the so-called communion service, I was never told that the Lord's supper was a table, a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I was taught to take the holy communion by first examining myself to see whether I was sinful or not.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would ask myself about my heart, my mind, my thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would ask how I was with my parents, teachers, schoolmates, neighbors, or friends.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was then taught to remember the Lord by remembering how He was God, how He became a man, how He was born in a manger, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, I was not told that at the Lord's table I have to enjoy Him, that is, I have to eat Him and to drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To examine yourself and to remember what the Lord did for us is certainly not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the divine concept is that to remember the Lord is simply to eat and drink Him, to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians 11:24-25 says, "This is My body, which is for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me .This cup drink it, unto the remembrance of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup v. 26 , that is, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord, who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion, as our life and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to remember Him in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, we remember the Lord not by thinking about Him, but by eating, drinking, and enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord's table is a weekly proclamation, a declaration to the whole universe, that we daily enjoy Christ as our food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is our feast, our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Marriage Dinner of the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, when He comes, the overcoming believers will join Him to feast at the marriage dinner of the Lamb Rev 19:7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That unique, universal wedding feast will last one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This feast of one thousand years will be a wedding day to Christ because to the Lord one thousand years is as one day 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During those one thousand years, the church is the bride, and after the one thousand years, the church is the wife Rev 21:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The difference between a bride and a wife is that the bride is only the bride on the wedding day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the wedding day, the bride becomes the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the wedding day, there is the bridegroom and the bride; on the following day there is the husband and the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The millennial kingdom of one thousand years will be a wedding day to Christ, in which the overcoming believers will be with Christ, enjoying His wedding feast.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>An Eternal Feast</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gospel is a feast that will last for eternity; therefore, the Lord's table will never end. The Lord's table today is a foretaste of the coming full taste in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, that full taste will replace our present foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the table of this feast, we enjoy Christ Himself, who is for our eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are eating Christ John 6:35, 57 and drinking the Spirit John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 12:13 , who is also Christ Himself 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
