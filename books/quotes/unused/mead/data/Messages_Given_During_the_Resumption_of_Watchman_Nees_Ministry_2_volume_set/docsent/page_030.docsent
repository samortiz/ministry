   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN A TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:January 2, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Canton</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The year before last, the Communists entered the city of Chefoo, but the brothers and sisters in the local church still continued to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We did not register ourselves with the government, nor did we hand ourselves over to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The brothers and sisters continued to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The denominations used to be quite zealous in preaching the gospel, and they were critical of the local church, saying that we were narrow-minded and that we cared only for our own people and would not fellowship with others, nor would we preach the gospel in the rural villages.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, together with the brothers and sisters, we paid attention only to the matter of life and spiritual matters, and we were not affected by their criticisms.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day, when the time came, all the brothers and sisters rose up to preach the gospel, and we baptized one hundred two people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After that time, we had more baptisms.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There were twelve or thirteen denominations in our city that met on Sunday, but their total number did not match the attendance of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Three or four of these denominational churches could seat over a thousand people, yet their numbers were still less than ours.</S>
