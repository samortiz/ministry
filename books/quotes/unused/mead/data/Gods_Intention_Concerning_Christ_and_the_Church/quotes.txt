[1]  God s Intention Concerning Christ and the Church CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS OUR PORTION Scripture Reading: Col 1:12-19, 27; 2:9, 16-17; 3:4, 9-11; Phil 3:7-8, 10; John 1:4; 10:10b; 11:25; 6:35, 57, 63 CHRIST BEING GIVEN TO US TO BE
[3]  We need to be clear that in eternity past God the Father predestinated us to partake of Christ and Christ alone.
[4]  Thus, Paul wrote this letter to the believers to reveal to them God s thought that Christ was meant to be our unique portion and that God has nothing for us other than Christ Himself.
[5]  In Colossians Paul reveals that Christ is not only our life but also our everything.
[6]  Since Christ is the reality of every positive thing, and since it is God s desire that Christ would be everything to us, we need to experience Christ in every way.
[7]  We can live by Christ day by day and experience Christ as everything to us because Christ is our real life.
[8]  The life that we received from our parents is not our real life; it is only a figure and a shadow, pointing us to Christ who is our real life.
[9]  If we do not have Christ, we do not have life.
[10]  We should no longer live by the natural life that we received from our parents but by the life that we received through regeneration, the life that is Christ Himself.
[11]  Christ is our life, the Spirit gives life, and Christ today is the Spirit.
[12]  AND THE GROWTH IN LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 6, 9, 14-16, 26; Gal 4:6; Luke 24:46-49; Acts 1:5, 8 THE SPIRIT BEING
[13]  God is in Christ to be life to us as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of life.
[14]  God is in Christ, Christ is life to us, and this causes us to become sons of God.
[15]  Being a Son Being a Matter of Life, Not of Power
[16]  As long as a child has the life of his father, he is his father s son.
[17]  This point is illustrated in Romans 8:26, which says, Moreover, in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness, for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[18]  In addition to receiving the Spirit of life, we must receive the Spirit of power.
[19]  However, in order to properly handle the power that we receive by being clothed with the Spirit, we must have the adequate growth in life.
[20]  THROUGH THE CROSS AND BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 1:16; 2:20; 3:27; 4:19; 5:4; 4:6; 3:3; 5:16, 18, 22, 25; 6:14-15 MAN S THOUGHT VERSUS GOD S THOUGHT
[21]  Christ Himself is the tree of life John 14:6; 15:1 , and God desires that we would take Christ to be our life Col 3:4 .
[22]  If you are not seeking God, you will not care about doing good to please God, but once you are revived and brought back to God, you will immediately have the thought that you must begin to try to do good to please God.
[23]  He wants to build into us not love but Christ, not humility but Christ, not a good temper but Christ, and not patience but Christ.
[24]  OF HAVING CHRIST WORKED INTO OUR BEING Christ Being Revealed in Us
[25]  Our experience of Christ being worked into our being is progressive and involves several steps.
[26]  At the very moment we received Christ as our Savior, Christ entered into us.
[27]  We may not have known that Christ had entered into us, but this is what happened, and this was our experience.
[28]  This is the first step that God takes in His plan to work Christ into us; that is, He enters into us and reveals Christ within us.
[29]  When Christ has been revealed in us, when we have put on Christ, when Christ is living in us, and when Christ has been formed in us, we will be filled with Christ Eph 3:19b .
[30]  To be filled with Christ is to have our entire being saturated with Christ and occupied by Christ so that when we think, Christ thinks in us; when we love, Christ loves through us; and when we make a decision, Christ makes that decision in us.
[31]  THROUGH THE CROSS AND BY THE SPIRIT Applying the Cross in Our Daily Life
[32]  The book of Galatians reveals that God s desire that Christ would be worked into our being is accomplished by two means the cross and the Spirit.
[33]  Several times in Galatians the apostle Paul tells us that we have been crucified with Christ 2:20; 6:14 .
[34]  Thus, whenever we are going to do something, we must remember that we have been crucified with Christ and ask ourselves, Am I doing this, or is Christ doing this?
[35]  If we are about to do something that is not of God, we are conscious that we do not have peace within, and if we are about to do something that is of God, we have a sense of peace within.
[36]  We will grow in life day by day, Christ will be formed within us, and we will learn a great deal concerning Christ and concerning how to cooperate with Him, how to experience Him as our life, and how to take Him as life.
[37]  Then we will be filled with Christ, Christ will be formed within us, and we will have all the items of the fruit of the Spirit, by which Christ will be manifested through us.
[38]  FILLED WITH LIFE AND TO BE INCLUSIVE THE REALITY OF THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST AS LIFE
[39]  The church is not an organization but an organism, a body the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23; Col 1:18 .
[40]  ISSUING FROM THE GROWTH IN LIFE The Proper Church Government
[41]  However, since there is a lack of life among the Lord s children, it is very difficult for the proper government in the church to exist.
[42]  A PROPER CHURCH NEEDING TO BE INCLUSIVE Receiving Everything
[43]  A proper church must not only take the way of life; it must also be inclusive.
[44]  We must be inclusive of and open to all the Lord s children, and we must be inclusive of all spiritual matters.
[45]  In every local church we must have the line of the inner life, the line of the truth, the line of the church life, the line of the preaching of the gospel, which includes the preaching of the gospel in foreign countries, and the line of power, which includes the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and all the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
[46]  from the History of the Lord s Recovery Martin Luther and Justification by Faith
[47]  If we consider the history of the church over the past four to five hundred years, we will see that during this time the Lord has recovered many things.
[48]  Question: What is the best place in which to hold the meetings of the church?
[49]  CHAPTER FIVE THREE NECESSITIES FOR OUR CHRISTIAN LIFE Scripture Reading: John 3:6; 6:36, 57, 63; 15:4-5 BEING REGENERATED JOHN 3
[50]  In John 3 the Lord met with a man named Nicodemus vv.
[51]  The Lord said to Nicodemus, That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit v. 6 . The Lord s answer indicates that apart from regeneration, flesh can never be changed into something other than flesh.
[52]  Furthermore, He would become the life-giving Spirit v. 45 . As the Spirit He would not only return to be with His disciples; He would also enter into them to dwell in them and to be one with them John 14:20 . After telling the disciples that He would return and enter into them as the Spirit, the Lord said to His disciples, I am the vine; you are the branches 15:5a . He told them that they would abide in Him and He would abide in them v. 4 . In saying this, the Lord assured them that He would never leave them, because He would be in them, and they would be able to live with Him, in Him, and through Him.
[53]  We must realize the spiritual fact that Christ is within us as our life and then learn how to deny our self, give up our natural life, and take Christ as our life Matt 16:24; Col 3:4 .
[54]  CHAPTER SIX GOD S INTENTION AND ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:9-10, 16; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Cor 3:17-18; 4:16; Eph 3:16-19; 4:22-24; Col 3:9-11 GOD S INTENTION BEING
[55]  God s eternal intention and purpose is to work Himself into us and to have Christ wrought into our being.
[56]  God s desire is to make us Christ-men men who have been mingled with Christ to be one with Him.
[57]  Similarly, God justified, redeemed, and regenerated us so that He could work Christ into us and cause us to be filled, saturated, and mingled with Christ.
[58]  The purpose of God is that Christ would be mingled with us so that we would be filled, possessed, and saturated with Christ and by Christ.
[59]  Since God s eternal purpose is to work Himself into us, we need to see how we can be saturated with Christ and possessed by Him in a full way.
[60]  We also need to see the way to experience Christ as our life in a practical way in our daily life.
[61]  Christ today is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 , we human beings have a human spirit Job 32:8; 1 Cor 2:11 , and as the Spirit, Christ is dwelling within us in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .
[62]  May the Lord help us to experience Christ in this way, and may we all pray to be strengthened into the inner man that we may deny the self and go along with the inner man so that we will be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[63]  In the phrase God and Father we see God the Father; in the phrase our Lord Jesus Christ we see God the Son; and in the phrase every spiritual blessing we see God the Spirit.
[64]  Our experience also shows us that it is impossible to separate the Father from the Son or the Lord from the Spirit.
[65]  According to 1 Corinthians 12:3, we may contact the Spirit by saying, Jesus is Lord! and according to Galatians 3:14 we may receive the Spirit by believing in Jesus.
[66]  The One who comes into us is the Spirit, yet the One whom we believe in and call upon is the Lord Jesus.
[67]  The Scriptures are clear that we can never lose our salvation, but how does God deal with believers who commit sins and refuse to repent even after they have been saved?
[68]  The Scriptures reveal that God s eternal purpose, His intention, is to express Himself through His Son, Christ, and through the church as the Body of Christ John 1:18; Heb 1:3; 1 Tim 3:16 .
[69]  What God has done in the past, what He is doing in the present, and what He will do in the future are all for this goal to gain a group of people who are saved and filled with Him to be the Body of Christ as the expression of God in Christ as the Spirit.
[70]  The Lord s mind, thought, intention, and heart are for the Body, the church, and the building up of the local churches in various places.
[71]  If there are a few thousand believers in a locality built up together as one Body, they will have an impact, but even if there are only a few saints in a locality built up together, they will still have an impact.
[72]  TO HAVE THE REAL CHRISTIAN WALK Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22-23; 5:31-32; 2:14, 12, 15; 4:24 THE CHURCH BEING THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST
[73]  Ephesians 1:22-23 says, He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.
[74]  These verses tell us that the Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ.
[75]  The church being the fullness of Christ means that the church is something of Christ and something that issues out of the resurrection life of Christ; the church being the Body of Christ means that the church is Christ Himself; and the church being the new man means that the church is a new creation 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15 .
[76]  Second Corinthians 3:17 states that the Lord is the Spirit, Romans 8:16 reveals that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
[77]  They also show us that if we desire to know the Lord in a practical way and to experience Him in our daily life, we must learn to discern our spirit.
[78]  If we do not know our human spirit, we cannot understand God s moving within us and cannot follow the Lord, because the Lord today is the Spirit living within our spirit.
[79]  If we have followed the Lord for some time, we may know in a general way that the Lord is within us, but we may not know exactly where the Lord is within us.
