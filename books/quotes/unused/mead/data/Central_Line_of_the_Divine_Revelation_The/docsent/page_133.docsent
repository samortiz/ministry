   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Firstfruits of the Feast of the Firstfruits,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>after Being Offered to God for His Enjoyment,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>to Be Eaten by the People of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The firstfruits of the Feast of the Firstfruits, after being offered to God for His enjoyment, were to be eaten by the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This signifies that the resurrected Christ, after being presented to God in His freshness John 20:16-17 , is to be dispensed, with all the riches of His resurrection, into us for our enjoyment Lev 23:14; 1 Cor 15:14, 17; Rom 4:25b; Phil 3:10a, 11b .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the record of Leviticus 23, the offering of only one of the seven feasts, the Feast of the Firstfruits, was to be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have seen, the firstfruits refer to Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The firstfruits were not to be eaten immediately after being reaped.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This signifies that after the reaping we must first offer Christ to God in His freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is unveiled in John 20.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the morning of the resurrection Mary saw the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When she tried to touch Him, the Lord said, "Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" v. 17 . Christ became our portion only after His freshness in resurrection had first been offered to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever Christ is as our portion to be eaten is related to His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The blood of the Passover lamb signifies the crucified Christ, but the meat of the lamb signifies the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The blood was from the crucified Christ, but the meat refers to the Christ who is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If Christ were not the Spirit in resurrection, we could not take Him in. The crucified Christ alone is not our life supply; only Christ in resurrection can be our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The unleavened bread of the Passover was made of grain that had been ground and blended to be one loaf, signifying death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, both the meat of the lamb and the unleavened bread signify Christ as the Spirit in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is Christ in His resurrection who dispenses Himself into us as many items.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why the offering of only one of the seven feasts, the Feast of the Firstfruits, was to be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the type of the feasts, what we enjoy and what is being dispensed into us is the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The resurrected Christ is the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In eternity past God was not yet consummated, but after He passed through the processes of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God was consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now He possesses the divine nature and a human nature with incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now He is the processed, consummated, and compound God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is such a One who is good for us to eat and who, in His resurrection and consummation, dispenses Himself into us.</S>
