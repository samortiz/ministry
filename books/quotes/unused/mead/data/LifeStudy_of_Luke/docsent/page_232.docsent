   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SEVENTY-NINE THE MAN-SAVIOR S ASCENSION 4 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22, 10; Col 1:18; Eph 1:23; 3:19b; Heb 4:14; 7:26, 22; 8:6; 9:15-16; Rev 1:13; 2:1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall give a concluding word on the subjective aspect of the Man-Savior s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that in His ascension Christ was given to be the Head over all things to the church so that all things might be headed up in Him Eph 1:22, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we shall go on to see that the ascended Christ is the Head of the church and also the High Priest in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH, HIS BODY,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>TO EXPRESS GOD IN HIS FULLNESS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In His ascension Christ was made the Head of the church, His Body, to express God in His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Colossians 1:18 says, He is the Head of the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Ephesians 1:23, His Body is the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Ephesians 3:19 Paul speaks of our being filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All this fullness dwells in Christ Col 1:19; 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through His dwelling in us, Christ imparts His unsearchable riches into our being, so that eventually we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This makes us the expression of God, which is what the church should be.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Oneness of the Head and the Body</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the Head of the church, His Body, Christ certainly is joined to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just as in one s physical body the head and the body are one, so Christ, the Head, and the church, His Body, are joined and therefore are one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It would be absurd to think that one s head is not related to one s body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, it would also be a mistake to think that as the Head Christ is far away from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, some think that Christ is far away from us, the members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to this concept, the Head is in the heavens, and the Body is on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To those who hold this concept it seems that there is a vast distance between the Head in the heavens and the Body on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How, then are the Head and Body connected?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This understanding of the Head and the Body is nonsensical.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His ascension Christ was made the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can we say that the Head is in the heavens and that the church, the Body, is on earth, far away from the Head?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the Bible, the Head is not alone in the heavens without His Body, and the Body is not on earth without the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Body without the Head would be a monstrosity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No doubt, the Bible reveals that Christ, the Head, has ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We, of course, are on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then where are the Head and the Body in heaven or on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Head and the Body are one and form a universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But is this universal man in heaven or on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you say that the Head is in heaven and the Body is on earth, you will be seriously mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If this is the situation, what joins the Head and the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some may say that the Head and the Body are both in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But what does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Does it mean that sometimes we are in heaven and that at other times we are on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In answering the question concerning the location of the Head and the Body, we need to realize that this does not involve the elements of space and time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With material things there are these elements.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But with divine things there is neither the element of space nor the element of time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For Christ to be the Head of the church, His Body, is certainly not a material thing; this is altogether a divine matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With this divine matter there is not the element of space nor the element of time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we need to see that in the divine life and in the divine Spirit, we, the believers, are one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Body is one with the Head in the divine life and in the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regarding the Head and the Body, we should not consider space and time, for here these elements do not apply.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As members of the Body in the divine life and the divine Spirit, we are not separated by space or time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all are now in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We would emphasize the fact that with material matters we have the elements of space and time, but we do not have these elements with divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, the Lord Jesus said, No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven John 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here the Lord says that although He came down from heaven, He was still in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that while He was on earth, He was still in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to His physical body, He was on earth when He spoke these words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But according to His divine being, which does not involve the elements of space and time, He was in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the church life we should not consider the Head and the Body from a physical point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, we need to consider the Head and the Body from the divine viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the divine viewpoint, we are one with the ascended Christ, and His ascension is also ours Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here in the ascension we express Him in His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Fullness of Christ for His Expression</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Ephesians 3:19 speaks of our being filled unto all the fullness of God, and 1:23 says that the church, His Body, is the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have often pointed out that this fullness is the result, the issue, of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Through the enjoyment of Christ s riches we become His fullness to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we enjoy Christ, there will be a result of this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The result of enjoying Christ is the fullness, and this fullness is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the church life, which is the fullness of Christ, the church expresses Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This expression of Christ in the church is in the divine nature and the divine sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can see from this that Christ s ascension has much to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is in His ascension that we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Furthermore, in His ascension, not merely in His resurrection, He is our Head and we are His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The New Testament does not say that it was in Christ s resurrection that God made Him Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rather, the Bible reveals that it was in His ascension that God made Christ the Head of the church, His Body.</S>
