   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His creation God prepared the Red Sea to serve as a baptistry for His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then during the exodus He led the people to this baptistry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was according to the plan of God, which was to bring His chosen people into a situation that they might be completely delivered from the power of the world unto Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moses was a type of Christ and a representative of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the children of Israel being baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea typifies that we have been baptized into Christ in the Spirit and in the water.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, the Egyptian army, horses, and chariots that pursued them also went into the sea after them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord confused the army of the Egyptians and took off their chariot wheels.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then God commanded Moses to stretch out his hand over the sea so that the waters would come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the water of the Red Sea drowning the Egyptian army typifies that the death of Christ has destroyed the power of the world for us.</S>
