<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>According to the Teaching<br>of the Anointing of the Triune God</H2><P>We abide in the Triune God by the person of the linking Spirit and according to the teaching of the anointing of the Triune God (1 John 2:27). By studying the context of 1 John 2:27, we can see that the anointing is of the Triune God. The pronouns "Him" and "His" refer both to the Son and the Father who were previously mentioned (v. 24). They may also refer to the eternal life (v. 25). The anointing is the anointing of the Father, the Son, and the eternal life.</P><P>The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit, the compound ointment. This ointment is similar to paint, which is composed of certain elements. This ointment is divine ointment, divine paint. In this divine paint are the element of the Father, the element of the Son, and the element of the eternal life. This divine ointment, this divine paint, is typified in Exodus 30 by the anointing oil, the compound ointment (vv. 23-25). The move of this ointment is the anointing. We have such an anointing within us, and this anointing teaches us. We have to learn to abide in this wonderful One, who is Christ, the Lord, the Son, the Father, and God. We have to abide in such a wonderful One, not only by the linking Spirit but also according to the teaching of the move of this ointment.</P><P>When we are in the meetings of the church or of the ministry, we have a deep and clear sensation that something is moving within us. This is the Spirit as the ointment moving within us. There is a divine paint moving within us. By this moving of the ointment, this anointing, we are made clear concerning what we should be, what we should say, who we should contact, where we should go, and what we should do. If we are abiding in Christ, the Lord, the Son, the Father, and God, we will live according to the teaching of the anointing in all the affairs of our daily life. Sometimes the inner anointing tells us not to laugh that much, so we have to be one with Him. The anointing teaches us. This is the anointing of the divine paint, which is a composition of the Father and the Son with His eternal life. These elements are marvelous. The sonship, the fatherhood, and the eternal life are compounded into the compound ointment which moves in us, and that moving is the anointing. This anointing teaches us at all times so that we can know His will, His heart's desire, His very nature, and His being. By His teaching we know what kind of person the inner anointing wants us to be. To live according to the teaching of the anointing of the Triune God is to live in the Divine Trinity.</P>
