THE LORD AS THE WORD SO THAT MAN MAY HAVE LIFE</h2>
<p>Chapters 3 through 6 of the Gospel of John reveal that the Lord is the Word so that man may have life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Case in John 3</h2>
<p>John 3 begins by speaking of Nicodemus, who was a very orthodox Jewish religionist. Nicodemus realized that Jesus the Nazarene was unique, but he also knew that many people despised Him. Consequently, he was uncomfortable visiting Him during the day. Instead, he came to see the Lord Jesus secretly at night, respectfully calling Him Rabbi, which means &ldquo;teacher.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;You have come from God as a teacher&rdquo; (v. 2). When the Lord responded, He did not arrogantly say, &ldquo;I am not merely a rabbi, I am superior to the rabbis; I am God, the Lord who created all things.&rdquo; There was no sense of such an attitude from the Lord. Instead, He said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 3). The Lord Jesus did not speak of Himself as being God or even the Lord. Instead, His speaking was related to man&rsquo;s receiving of Him.</p>
<p>As soon as Nicodemus heard the Lord Jesus, he was not afraid to speak further. When the Lord said, &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God,&rdquo; Nicodemus asked, &ldquo;How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born, can he?&rdquo; (v. 4). The Lord Jesus explained, saying, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (v. 6). The Lord told Nicodemus that &ldquo;being born anew&rdquo; was not related to the flesh, to entering into his mother&rsquo;s womb a second time. This would not only be impossible, but it would be useless because that which is born of the flesh would still be flesh. Only the human spirit can be born again of the Spirit. When Nicodemus heard this, he immediately asked, &ldquo;How can these things be?&rdquo; (v. 9). The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You are a teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things?...As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 10, 14-15). The conversation between Nicodemus and the Lord does not convey the impression that Nicodemus had met the high God, because Nicodemus met the Word, the God who has come forth. John then revealed that those who believe into Him as the Word have eternal life.</p>
<p>The Lord told Nicodemus that He did not come as God to be worshipped or as the Lord to be served. Moreover, He did not even come to be a teacher. Rather, just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, the Lord came to be lifted up, to die, so that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life. He has come as the Word of God to utter God, to release God, to declare God so that man may receive and obtain God. In Him, as the Word, was life; when man obtains the Lord as the Word, he obtains life. The Lord Jesus did not come as God or as the Lord but as the Word; He came so that man may have life (10:10). The Lord is God&rsquo;s utterance, God&rsquo;s coming forth; in Him is life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Case in John 4</h2>
<p>John 4 shows a different picture. Chapter 3 speaks of an orthodox religionist, whereas chapter 4 speaks of an improper and superstitiously religious woman. She was religious and worshipped God, yet she had had five husbands, and the one she was currently with was not her husband (v. 18). Even though she was living a defiled life, she could talk about religion in a superstitious way. She was completely different from Nicodemus. In the preceding chapter there is a proper person; in this chapter there is a dishonorable woman. In the preceding chapter there is a human being seeking the Lord Jesus; in this chapter the Lord Jesus is seeking a human being.</p>
<p>When the woman went to draw water, the Lord Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Give Me something to drink&rdquo; (v. 7). The Samaritan woman marveled and said, &ldquo;How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman?&rdquo; (v. 9). Then the Lord talked to her in an ordinary manner, going back and forth with questions and answers. The woman did not have any sense that the One in front of her was God, the Savior. As their conversation progressed, the Lord let the woman know that He had what she needed&mdash;living water that quenches the thirst of human beings. The woman immediately said, &ldquo;Sir, give me this water&rdquo; (v. 15). The Lord Jesus is truly the Word; as the Word, He is God&rsquo;s utterance, God&rsquo;s explanation, so that man may be clear concerning God. The woman was at first unclear concerning spiritual matters, but when she heard the Lord&rsquo;s speaking and learned of the Lord being living water, she asked Him for this water. God spoke, and this woman met the One who is the Word. The Lord Jesus knew that she wanted living water, so He said, &ldquo;Go, call your husband and come here&rdquo; (v. 16). The woman was clever and covered up her situation with facts, saying, &ldquo;I do not have a husband&rdquo; (v. 17). Knowing this, the Lord said, &ldquo;You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). The Lord&rsquo;s word touched her history and her living; her whole secret story was in the light. This shows that there is life in the Word and that this life becomes the light of men when it enters into men.</p>
<p>Once the Lord Jesus spoke these words to the woman, she understood. The Lord Jesus manifested Himself to her not as God or as the Lord but as the Word. In the Word was life; once man touches the Word and believes the Word, he touches life. The Lord said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly&rdquo; (10:10). In other words, the Lord did not come for man to worship Him, to serve Him, or to do good. The Lord came so that man may have life and may have it abundantly. The Lord gives man life in the Word. When man comes to the Lord, he sees God coming forth as the Word. Man meets the Lord by touching the Word.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
