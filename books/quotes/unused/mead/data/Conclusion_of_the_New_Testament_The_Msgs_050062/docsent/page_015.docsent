   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>24.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Reality</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus also says that He is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apart from the Triune God, the entire universe is vanity, having no content, no reality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the way to the Father, Christ is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If He were not the reality, He could not be our way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The way needs the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we call on a name other than the name of the Lord Jesus, we shall not have a way into God, because all other names are void of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately on the way into God because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, when we call on the name of Jesus, we receive something real into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The reality we receive by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus is the being and the doing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, this reality is the incarnated God John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This reality is also the Son John 8:32, 36 and the Spirit John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the reality is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, this reality includes what the Triune God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the gospel Eph 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reality, therefore, is the very being of the Triune God and what He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the universe only what God is and what God does are real.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that the reality in the universe is God's being and God's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's being is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and His doing is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the gospel He is everything and has done everything necessary for us to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive this universal reality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reality is actually the way, and the way is the destination.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we get on the way, we arrive at the destination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that when we receive the Lord Jesus, we have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we receive the Son as the way, we have the Father as the destination.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the Son is the embodiment of the Father, when we call on the name of the Lord we have both the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the reality becoming the way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the Son with what He has done becoming our way to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We get on this way simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we call on the Lord's name, we have the reality, we are on the way, and we have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>25.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Hope of Glory</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To the believers Christ is also the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Colossians 1:27 Paul speaks of "Christ in you, the hope of glory."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ not only dwells within us; He dwells within us as our hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ can be our hope of glory because He dwells in our spirit to be our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to Colossians 3:4, when Christ our life is manifested, we also shall be manifested with Him in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will appear to be glorified in our redeemed and transfigured body Rom 8:23; Phil 3:21; 2 Thes 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Christ comes, we shall be glorified in Him, and He will be glorified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that the indwelling Christ will saturate our entire being, including our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This will cause our body to be transfigured and to become like His glorious body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At that time Christ will be glorified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is Christ in us as the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul's word in Ephesians 1:18 about the hope of His calling is related to Christ's being the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know certain things, the first of which is the hope of God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before we were saved, we had no hope.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We were "apart from Christ having no hope and without God in the world" Eph 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But now that we are saved, we are no longer without hope; instead, we are full of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, because many believers do not know what a hope is theirs, Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order to know the hope of God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As God's called people we are full of hope, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First Timothy 1:1 speaks of "Christ Jesus our hope."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is not only our Savior; He is also our hope to bring us into the full blessing and enjoyment of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our hope is singly and uniquely Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every aspect of our hope is related to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Other aspects of our hope include the rapturous transfer from the earthly and physical realm to the heavenly sphere and glorification Rom 8:23-25, 30; Phil 3:21 ; the coming salvation of the soul 1 Pet 1:5, 9 , the Lord's bringing of our soul into His enjoyment; the kingly enjoyment with Christ in the millennium Rev 5:10; 2 Tim 4:18; Matt 25:21, 23 ; and the consummate enjoyment of Christ in the New Jerusalem with the universal and eternal blessings in the new heaven and new earth Rev 21:1-7; 22:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Colossians 1:27 Paul specifically says that Christ is the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Glory is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God has ordained that we should be brought into this glory 1 Cor 2:7 , and, as believers, we have been called into this glory 1 Thes 2:12; 1 Pet 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, when we were regenerated, Christ as the life of glory came into us as a divine seed that eventually will blossom into the full expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Christ who was God's expression, the effulgence of God's glory Heb 1:3 , now dwells within us to be our hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Glory is still a hope to us because it has not yet come out of us in a visible way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Just as we hope for the blossoming of a seed that has been sown, so we hope for the blossoming of the life of glory that is now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our hope of such a glory is the indwelling Christ Himself.</S>
