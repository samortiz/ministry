   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WRECKED FOR THE LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now this matter of the oneness of the church is very clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First of all, we should not insist on anything but the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And we should not impose anything other than the faith on others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, we should not be influenced by any kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must "stick" to the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regardless of what others teach, we should not be distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we pay attention to any kind of doctrine, it will be exceedingly easy for us to be carried away by the wind of doctrine from the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must be for the local church nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must be just like the wood that is used to build a wooden stand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the pieces of wood are good for nothing but the stand; they have been ruined for everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the same way, we all need to be ruined for everything but the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some friends with good intentions have come to me and said, "Brother Lee, we love you, but you have taken the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you would not take this way of the local church, but do as we do, you would be much in demand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are so sorry for you."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are sorry for me, but I am so happy for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I like to be wrecked for the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I like to be ruined for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am good for nothing but the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not care about a certain kind of doctrine or a certain kind of spiritual teaching; I only care for the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The goal is so clear to us, and the way is so certain to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have no other choice but the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must not care for anything but the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is one Body, one Spirit, and one hope.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And there is one God, the Father of all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we are all one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why we are so broad and so all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not care for anything but the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>ARRIVING AT THE UNITY OF THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May we have the Lord's grace that we may keep the oneness by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must grow and grow in life until we drop all the toys of different doctrines or teachings and "all arrive at the unity of the faith" Eph 4:13, Greek .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the time we were saved, we all had the unity of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But afterward, due to our childhood, we gradually picked up many different doctrines or teachings by which we were intentionally or unintentionally divided.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we grow in life, we will spontaneously and gradually drop the doctrines of dissent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we grow in the Lord, the more we will relinquish the doctrinal toys.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more mature we become, the less we will take pleasure in doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day, by the growth and maturity of life, we will "arrive at the unity of the faith," and all the toys of doctrines which immature ones keep will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Oh, how we need to return to the unity of the faith from so many doctrines or teachings of dissent!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>So many of us have been carried away by the "wind of doctrine" for too long a time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now is the time for us to be brought back.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This requires a real turn to the Lord and growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For the church life we need to be brought back to the unity of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For the local church we need to be brought back from all the divisive doctrines of dissent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For the Lord's recovery of the genuine Body life, we need the genuine oneness, which is both the unity of the Spirit and the unity of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the divisive doctrines must go; only the Spirit and the faith should remain!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May the Lord have mercy upon us and all His children!</S>
