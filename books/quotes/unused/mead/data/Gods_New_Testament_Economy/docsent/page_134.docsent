   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE NEW JERUSALEM S</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>APPLICATION TO THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE TRIUNE LIVING Scripture Reading: John 1:13; Eph 4:18; 1 John 4:8, 16; 1:5, 2-3; Col 2:9; 3:4; Rev 2:7; Phil 1:20; John 14:17a; 15:26; 16:13-15; Rom 8:2; Rev 22:17b; Phil 1:19 THE PICTURE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I hope that we all have been impressed with the picture that we have seen concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The holy city is a golden mountain and around this mountain is a wall built with jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The city itself lies foursquare Rev 21:16 with its length, breadth, and height equal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the bottom of the wall are twelve layers of precious stone as the wall s foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On each of the four sides of the wall are three pearl gates.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the top of the city is a throne and this throne is the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lamb is the lamp of the city and God is within the Lamb as the light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Out of the throne proceeds the river of water of life and this river is in the middle of a golden street which goes down the mountain in a spiral fashion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the two sides of the river grows the tree of life, which is a vine spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life, producing new fruit each month, for God s people to receive and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE LIVING OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a picture has helped us to see the entry into the city, the constitution of the city with the divine element of the Triune God, and the existence of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now we need to see the living of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The living of the city is also triune.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Jerusalem we see that the One sitting on the throne is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This refers to God the Father who is within the Lamb as the light and who is the source of life John 5:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Proceeding out of the throne is the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 7:38-39 indicates that the river of water of life denotes the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this river grows the tree of life which refers to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, we see the triune living of the New Jerusalem the Father sitting on the throne as the source, the Spirit flowing out of the Father as a river, and the Son as the tree of life growing in the Spirit to express Himself for the life supply of the entire city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, the city s living is the Triune God s living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In eternity in the new heaven and the new earth, the Triune God and His redeemed people are one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Triune God and His chosen, redeemed, called, forgiven, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people will be mingled together as one for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some believers may feel that God is one entity and that they are another entity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, we must realize that God is not only with us and in us but also mingled with us 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Christians do not believe in the truth of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They contend that it is a heresy to say that a person is mingled with God and that this is to make yourself God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They feel that to say that God is mingled with man is to lower down God by making Him a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible, however, tells us that the Word became flesh John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Word is God and flesh is man, which means that God made Himself man and was a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God became a man and He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the last three and a half years of His earthly life, He traveled and ministered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was a genuine, perfect man with a stomach to digest food, with tears to shed, and with blood to shed on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To say that God became a man is not to lower down God, but to honor and respect Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a wonder it is that God became a man, that the Creator became a creature!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What a glory that our God made Himself a man!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To say that we are mingled with God, though, does not mean that we become God in His deity and that we are qualified to be the object of people s worship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a top blasphemy and is utterly heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To say that we have been born of God, though, and that we have the life of God and the nature of God is a divine, scriptural fact John 1:13; 1 John 5:11-12; 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since we all were born of a man, this makes us a man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever is born of a dog is a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because we were born of a man, we have a man s life and a man s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In like manner, the fact that we have been born of God means that we have God s life and God s nature and that we are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you say that you are God and that you are deified with His deity and Godhead to be an object of worship, this is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, if you say that you are like God in your being 1 John 3:2 , having His life and nature, this is the truth according to the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The New Testament tells us that the Lord Jesus is God and the Son of God; also the Lord Jesus is man as well as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some of the church fathers have used the term deification to describe the fact that we have been mingled with God and that we are partakers of God s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you use the word deified, though, if you mean that you have been made God in His Godhead to be an object of worship, this is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the other hand, if your denotation is that through regeneration you have received God s life and nature and that now you are a son of God, this is altogether safe and scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all have to admit and boast of the wonderful fact that we have been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have received His life and His nature, and we are now partakers of the divine nature, enjoying the divine nature daily.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We and our God are mingled together as one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the one hand, we are one with God, being mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the other hand, He is the object of our worship and we are His worshippers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First Corinthians 6:17 tells us that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The New Testament also tells us that God dwells in us and that we are dwelling in God 1 John 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The fact that we are in God and God is in us is coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Coinherence is even deeper than mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even today we and God are not two entities but one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When eternity comes, we will not be an entity separate from God, but we will be one with God, thus one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This one divine entity is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can see God in the New Jerusalem in His Trinity, and we can see ourselves in the New Jerusalem in a triune way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our entry into the New Jerusalem is triune, our constitution is triune, our existence is triune, and now we must see that our living is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We live triunely with the Father, with the Son, and with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church life today as a precursor of the New Jerusalem should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church life is a miniature of the New Jerusalem, but in its nature and in the intrinsic element of the triune living, the church today should be exactly the same as its full consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Individually we are a small New Jerusalem and corporately as the church life we are also a miniature New Jerusalem.</S>
