[1]  A General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church
[2]  TO THE BOOK OF REVELATION Scripture Reading: Rev 1:1-2, 9; 19:10; 1:12, 20; 21:23; 22:1; 1:14-15
[3]  Chapter twenty-one tells us that God is the light and Christ is the lamp v. 23 . At the beginning there are the local churches as the lampstands in each locality to hold Christ as the lamp with God as the light.
[4]  Revelation 1:1-2 says, The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John, who testified the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, even all that he saw.
[5]  Verse 9 says, I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
[6]  Revelation 19:10b speaks again of the testimony of Jesus saying, I am your fellow slave and a fellow slave of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus.
[7]  The testimony of Jesus is mainly of two things on the positive side, that God is brought into man and man is brought into God, and on the negative side, that all the things that Satan brought in have been terminated on the cross by Christ s death.
[8]  The church life is the testimony of Jesus, a testimony that God is mingled with man and man is living in God, and that all the negative things Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, and the kingdom of darkness have been dealt with and put away.
[9]  The beginning of this book reveals the local churches as the lampstands holding Christ with God, and at the end of this book there is a universal expression composed of all the redeemed ones as a lampstand holding Christ as the center, as the reality, as the life, and as everything, with God as the light.
[10]  Revelation 2 and 3 contain the seven epistles to the churches, which are the last epistles given by the Lord to His church.
[11]  The second epistle is to the church in Smyrna, the church under the suffering of persecution 2:8-11 .
[12]  CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR THE EPISTLES TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES 2 Scripture Reading: Rev 2:18 3:22
[13]  Revelation is a book of prophecy in symbols, and the seven epistles in chapters two and three contain many symbols.
[14]  If we understand them only according to the words, they are not as meaningful, but when we understand them according to the symbols, they are much more meaningful.
[15]  The titles, names, and events in these chapters are symbols, showing us that by the third stage of the church the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans had caused the church to change in form and in nature.
[16]  The churches in Revelation 2 and 3 represent the stages of the history of the church.
[17]  The latter stages of the church have more to do with us today than the first ones, so we must be more familiar with them.
[18]  Chapters four and five of Revelation show us the scene around the throne in the heavens after Christ s ascension.
[19]  The first main item mentioned in chapter four is the throne of God set in heaven v. 2 . The throne of God is the very center of the entire universe and the very source of all things.
[20]  In Revelation, the throne of God is not the throne of mercy but the throne of divine authority for judgment.
[21]  That two kinds of precious stones describe the appearance of God signifies that the appearance of God is a testimony, a witness, testifying what kind of God He is.
[22]  Around the throne of God is a rainbow v. 3b . The rainbow is first mentioned in the Scriptures as a sign that the very God of life and redemption is the One who establishes and keeps His covenant Gen 9:12-17 . That the covenant in Genesis 9 was made for the sake of the inhabited earth indicates that although God will judge this earth with its inhabitants, He still remembers His covenant concerning the earth and will keep it.
[23]  In the scene around the throne in the heavens there are also four living creatures, having the appearance of a lion, a calf, a man, and an eagle 4:6-8 .
[24]  CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX THE SEVEN SEALS Scripture Reading: Rev 6 9
[25]  In the book of Revelation there are four big sevens the seven churches, seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls.
[26]  THE FIFTH SEAL THE CRY OF THE MARTYRED SAINTS
[27]  The insertion between the sixth and seventh seals shows us how God will be mindful of His people, both of Israel and of the church.
[28]  Before the damage brought in by the seven trumpets, God will take care of His people, desiring, if possible, to save them from these calamities.
[29]  After the one hundred forty-four thousand among the Jews are sealed, Revelation 7:9-17 shows the general state of the redeemed ones from the time of their rapture into the presence of God to eternity.
[30]  After the first four trumpets, a warning is issued to all the people who dwell on the earth v. 13 . In principle, we are sojourners on this earth, not those who dwell in it.
[31]  CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN THE SEVENTH TRUMPET Scripture Reading: Rev 10 11
[32]  The great tribulation will be a period of three and a half years Dan 7:25; 12:7; Rev 12:14 , which is forty-two months 11:2; 13:5 , or twelve hundred and sixty days 11:3; 12:6 , which is the last half of the last week in Daniel 9:24-27, beginning from the sixth seal, very close in time to the first five trumpets Rev 6:12-17; 8:7 9:11 .
[33]  In this way, the sixth seal and the first four trumpets are only alarms, warning those people dwelling on this earth that they need to repent before God, turn from the earth, and seek God.
[34]  As we have seen, chapter seven is the first insertion, between the sixth and seventh seals, and later we will see that there is a third insertion between the sixth and seventh bowls 16:13-16 .
[35]  Revelation 11:1 says, And there was given to me a reed like a rod, and someone said, Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it.
[36]  Revelation 21:15 mentions a golden reed for measuring, but there it is not like a rod.
[37]  The temple of God mentioned in verse 1 is the temple in the heavens, and the altar is not the altar of burnt offering but the incense altar, because it is with the temple, not outside of it.
[38]  The measuring of the temple of God and the incense altar in the heavens indicates that during the great tribulation the heavens will be preserved from being damaged, because in that three and a half years Satan will be cast out of heaven and down to earth.
[39]  Revelation 11:14 marks the beginning of the seventh trumpet.
[40]  Verse 15 continues, And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.
[41]  At the time the seventh trumpet sounds, the mystery of God will be finished, and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of God and Christ.
[42]  Verses 16-18 say, And the twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned.
[43]  Revelation 11:19 is a crucial verse, which says, And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple; and there were lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail.
[44]  Therefore, there is the need of a supplement, the second section of this book, to give us details concerning God s eternal purpose and how God will fulfill His purpose as the One who dwells in the temple with His testimony.
[45]  AND THE TWO BEASTS Scripture Reading: Rev 12 13
[46]  The first chapter of the second section of Revelation reveals a woman who brings forth a man-child 12:1-18 , and the last two chapters of this section also reveal a woman 21:2, 9; 22:17 .
[47]  Verse 5a says, And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.
[48]  Verses 7-9 say, And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon.
[49]  Verses 10-11 continue, And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night.
[50]  THE TWO BEASTS The Beast out of the Sea Antichrist
[51]  Verse 18 says, And he stood on the sand of the sea.
[52]  The Beast out of the Earth the False Prophet
[53]  Verse 11 says, And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.
[54]  Whereas Christ as the Lamb of God with seven horns has the seven Spirits of God 5:6 , this false lamb with two horns sends out unclean spirits 16:13 .
[55]  Revelation 14:6 and 7 say, And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel to announce to those dwelling on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give Him glory because the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who has made heaven and earth and the sea and the springs of waters.
[56]  To fear God, giving Him glory, and to worship Him are the two items of the eternal gospel Rev 14:7 .
[57]  This is due to the fact that at this time the Antichrist and his followers persecute God s people, having no fear of God.
[58]  The parable in Matthew 13:47-50 corresponds to the one in Matthew 25.
[59]  Verses 9 to 12 say, And another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God, which is mixed undiluted in the cup of His wrath; and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb.
[60]  AND BABYLON THE GREAT Scripture Reading: Rev 15 17
[61]  The treading of the winepress of the fury of God will occur at the very end of this age Rev 14:17-20 .
[62]  Revelation 15:1-2a says, And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having seven plagues, the last plagues; for in them the fury of God was finished.
[63]  Verse 13 says, And I saw, out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits as frogs.
[64]  Verses 14 to 16 continue, For they are spirits of demons doing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.
[65]  Chapters twelve through fourteen of Revelation are written in the way of symbols.
[66]  Revelation 17:1-2 says, And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and those who dwell on the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
[67]  Verse 7 says, And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel?
[68]  Revelation 19:1-6 is the praise of the great multitude of the saints, the angels, and all creatures.
[69]  After this, verse 7 says, Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.
[70]  On the negative side, the praise to God is for the fall of Babylon the Great, while on the positive side, it is because of the readiness of the glorious bride.
[71]  His being clothed with a garment dipped in blood is related to His treading of the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God v. 15; Isa 63:1-3 . That His name is called the Word of God means that He is the expression, the testimony, and the speaking of God.
[72]  Revelation 20:1-3 records the imprisonment of Satan for one thousand years in the abyss.
[73]  And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and of those who had not worshipped the beast nor his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
[74]  Revelation 20:6 says, Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.
[75]  Following this, there is the judgment of the great white throne.
[76]  Verses 11 and 12 say, And I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.
[77]  From this point we must spend much time to have a thorough view of the glorious city of New Jerusalem.
[78]  In the first two chapters is a garden which was the center of God s old creation Gen 2:8 , while in the last two chapters there is a holy city as the center of God s new creation Rev 21:2, 10; 22:14, 19 .
[79]  Verse 2 says, And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
[80]  The stars signify the patriarchs, the moon signifies God s people in the age of the law, and the sun signifies God s people in the age of grace.
[81]  Revelation 21:3 says, And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
[82]  Verses 5 and 6a say, And He who sits on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.
[83]  He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me. To thirst in verse 6 is to thirst not merely after God s redemption or God s work but after God Himself as the living water.
[84]  CHAPTER FORTY-THREE THE NEW JERUSALEM 2 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:12-21
[85]  Revelation 21:12-13 says, It had a great and high wall and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel: on the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.
[86]  Revelation 21:16 says, And the city lies square, and its length is as great as the breadth.
[87]  In the city proper there is only one kind of gold, but in the foundations of the wall there are twelve kinds of precious stones.
[88]  Verse 21b says, And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
[89]  Whenever we have a revival, we renew our experience of Christ s death and resurrection, and we begin again to walk on the street of gold, on the way of God s divine life and nature.
[90]  By His death and resurrection, we enter into the spiritual realm, into God Himself, and into His kingdom, the realm and sphere of God.
[91]  In this chapter we shall consider further aspects and applications of the structure and measurement of the New Jerusalem.
[92]  Revelation 21:17 speaks of another aspect of the holy city.
[93]  It says, And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.
[94]  Verses 12, 13, and 21 speak of the gates of the New Jerusalem.
[95]  We thank the Lord that in the holy city there is not only a wall but also twelve gates.
[96]  Some local churches have a wall without gates, so there is no way for people to enter in. If anyone wants to be saved and come into the church, it seems that they have to climb over the spiritual persons, that they must be holy and spiritual before they can enter in. Do we want this kind of Christian life and church life? The wall in our Christian life and church life must have adequate entrances in four directions.
[97]  In our Christian life and church life, we must have the separating wall of the holiness and appearance of God in His glory, but our separation must provide adequate entrances for people to contact us and enter in. We need the breaking to create openings in the wall, which are the Triune God as the three gates in four directions.
[98]  In this chapter we shall consider further aspects of the New Jerusalem and the concluding sections of Revelation.
[99]  Revelation 21:22 says, And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
[100]  In the holy city, however, there is no need to go to a certain place to serve God, for God Himself in Christ will be the temple.
[101]  THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF LIFE The River of Water of Life
[102]  The final chapter of the Scriptures, Revelation 22, begins, And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street v. 1 . The two God and the Lamb are on one throne, indicating that God is in the Lamb.
[103]  This is similar to 21:23, which tells us that God as the light is in the Lamb as the lamp.
[104]  In the flow there is the tree of life, the life supply.
[105]  That those who serve God will see His face indicates that genuine service leads us into fellowship and the presence of the Lord.
[106]  Verse 5 says, And night will be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will shine upon them; and they will reign forever and ever.
[107]  When we come into the Lord s presence, we are priests according to the order of Aaron, and when we come out from the presence of God to minister something of God to people, we are priests according to the order of Melchisedec, who ministered bread and wine Heb 5:6, 10; 6:20; 7:11, 17; Gen 14:18 .
[108]  In this way the entire city will feed on the Triune God, live by the Triune God, and be mingled with the Triune God to be built up together as one corporate Body to express Him, serve Him, and reign with Him to fulfill His eternal purpose.
[109]  Revelation 22:6 through 21 are the Lord s last warning and the apostle s last prayer.
[110]  That this word is similar to the word of God Himself in 21:6 proves that the Lord Jesus is the very God.
[111]  Finally, verses 18 to 21 say, I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this scroll; and if anyone takes away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this scroll.
[112]  May the Lord be gracious to us that we may truly see that God s ultimate intention, eternal purpose, and ultimate goal is to gain a Body for Christ as the corporate expression of the Triune God.
