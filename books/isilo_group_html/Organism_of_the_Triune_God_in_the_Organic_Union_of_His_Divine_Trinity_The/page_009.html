<p>The Spirit is also the consummation of the processed Triune God (Matt. 28:19b). God&rsquo;s Trinity was perfect, but it needed to be consummated. The divine Trinity was consummated through His incarnation, death, and resurrection. In resurrection, the divine Trinity was consummated in the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit is the consummation of the divine Trinity. In other words, the processed Spirit is the consummated Triune God. A raw fish is not consummated, but a cooked fish is consummated; it is ready to eat. After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection in Matthew 28, He told the disciples to go to the nations and baptize them into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. Such a divine title had never been mentioned until this time because the Trinity of the Godhead had not been consummated. The Trinity was not consummated until the Triune God had passed through the processes of incarnation, death, and resurrection. The divine Trinity has been consummated in the processed Spirit, so the processed Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit of Life and the Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>We may also say that the consummated Spirit is the consummated God as the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). Without the Spirit, we cannot be organic. Anything that is organic, that is of life, is of the Spirit. The Spirit is the Spirit of life. He is also the life-giving Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6b; 1 Cor. 15:45b). The Spirit is life, so He imparts life into us. When He comes into us, life comes with Him and is imparted into us by Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Sevenfold Intensified Spirit</h2>
<p>For the organism of the Triune God, the Spirit is also the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 1:4b; 4:5b; 5:6b). Some people have three-way lamps in their home. The third level of light is the most intense. The Spirit is like a seven-way lamp, shining in an intensified way. The book of Revelation reveals that the one Spirit of God is now sevenfold intensified. We are enjoying this sevenfold intensified Spirit in our organic union with Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
