   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 8 says, "But what does it say?"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"It" refers to Moses' word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul quoted Moses to show that even Moses preached justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is quite amazing, inasmuch as Moses was the promoter of the law and its requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But Paul introduced Moses, saying that Moses also spoke concerning justification by faith when he said, " The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,' that is, the word of the faith which we proclaim."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul maintained that Moses' words refer to justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To understand this quotation we need to go back to Deuteronomy 29 and 30 in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There Moses passed on all of God's law and commandments to the Israelites, telling them that if they failed to obey those commandments and keep the law, God would punish them by scattering them among the nations; and if their hearts would draw near to God in the dispersion, the word would be near them, even in their mouths and in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moses was saying that God's judgment would be present whenever man breaks the law and transgresses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What shall man do then?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He needs to receive a righteousness apart from the law, one which is in his mouth and in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a grace outside of the law is a gift to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Deuteronomy was quoted in Romans 10, a word of explanation was added.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>" The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,' that is, the word of the faith which we proclaim."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no thought of work here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The righteousness which is out of the law has been thoroughly transgressed against.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the people were scattered among the nations of the earth as predicted in Deuteronomy 30, they could no longer claim to have any work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The question of work was over.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The only word which they had then was the word that was in their mouth and in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Formerly it was a matter of works, and the result was dispersion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now there are no more works.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence it is of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul continued to define the meaning of "in your mouth" and "in your heart" in verse 9 by saying, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Dear friends, where is your mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Each one of us has brought our mouth to this place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>None has left his at home.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where our body is, there our mouth is also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the moment we believed in the Lord Jesus, we spontaneously confessed Him with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first words out of Paul's mouth when the Lord confronted him on the road were, "Who are You, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He had not believed in the Lord before.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But at that juncture he did believe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our confession of Jesus as Lord is made spontaneously from our heart rather than before people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It amazes me to think that some illiterate country folk who have never been exposed to the gospel before can say, "O Lord," upon hearing the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This cannot be a work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a spontaneous utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For one to believe in his heart is not a matter of work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no need to take any steps or to spend any money.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One only needs to say "O Lord" right where he is, and he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He can say it audibly or inaudibly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as he believes that God has brought Him down from the heavens and has brought Him up from Hades, everything will be worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will prove that he is justified and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our confession can never carry the element of merit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Confession is not a way to salvation; it is merely an expression of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a very spontaneous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we call Him Lord with our mouth and believe in Him in our heart, we shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no problem at all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 10 follows and explains verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why is one saved when he confesses with his mouth Jesus as Lord and believes in his heart that God has raised Him from the dead?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I was always perplexed as to how this matter could be put into people's hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I met two people today who consider this word of salvation too far from them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To them, this word is farther than the provinces of Yunnang and Tibet; it is farther than a foreign country.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is simply a word from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It seems that the word of salvation is so far away that it eludes them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nevertheless, God says that the way of salvation is not in heaven nor beneath the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is very near, in our mouth and even in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we had to ascend into the heavens or descend under the earth, we would wonder how anyone could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today the word is in your mouth and in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As long as a person opens his mouth and believes in his heart, he shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God has made this salvation so utterly available and convenient that if a person would believe in his heart and confess with his mouth, he shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Justification here is more a matter before God than before man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When men see you confessing, they will realize that you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When God sees you believing, He justifies you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Verse 11 says, "Everyone who believes on Him shall not be put to shame."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Faith alone is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although the Word of God is abundantly clear, there are still those who like to argue against it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They insist that confession is the way to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I wish to ask them, "If so, what will you do with Romans 10:8: The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart'?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Here it says the word of faith, not the word of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Scriptures say believe.''</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They do not say confess.''</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Verse 6 says, "But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Verse 6 speaks of the righteousness out of faith, and verse 8, the word of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is one confession in verse 9 and another in verse 10.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Both confessions are with the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, verse 11 does not say, "Everyone who confesses Him shall not be put to shame."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Rather, it says, "Everyone who believes on Him shall not be put to shame."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must recognize the emphasis here.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Verses 6, 8, and 11 mention "believe," and verses 9 and 10 mention "confess."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Verse 9 first says "confess" and then "believe"; whereas in verse 10 it is first "believe" and then "confess."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this one portion "believe" is used five times and "confess" twice.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>At the end, the order of "confess" and "believe" is reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All this signifies that salvation should be due to faith and not to confession.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Confession issues from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What one believes in his heart, he utters spontaneously with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A person will spontaneously say "daddy" when he sees his father.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Where there is faith, confession follows immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The end of verse 12 shows us that confession here is the confession of Jesus as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This confession comes from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>How can we prove this?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We may not see this from verses 1 through 11.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But verse 12 says, "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Verse 13 says, "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Calling upon the Lord's name is equivalent to the confessing of the Lord Jesus in the previous verses.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To call on the name of the Lord is to confess Jesus as Lord, to call Him Lord, and to address Him as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>By taking care of the context of this passage, we will realize that calling is simply confessing.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Verse 14 says, "How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?"</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is a wonderful word.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It shows that calling comes out of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Naturally, no one can call without believing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We can see that confessing with the mouth results from faith in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Because a man believes in his heart, he calls with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He calls because he believes.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Do you see this fact?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Everything issues from faith; faith is the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Although it mentions confession with the mouth, this confession is based upon faith in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It is natural for those who believe to call.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I believe tonight we are all saved ones who have received the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>May I ask how you have received Him?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We received Him by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Did you also pray?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Salvation is due to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Prayer is the expression of this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Everyone in the world is saved by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>However, this faith is expressed in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Faith is within and prayer is without.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When you believe in your heart that Jesus is the Savior, spontaneously you will pray with your mouth that Jesus is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Whoever believes in his heart will confess with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>But we must always remember that confession is not the way to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Although the word says "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved," yet calling is not the way to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The reason is that calling comes from faith; it is a spontaneous action, something uttered before God spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Let us come back to verse 12: "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all."</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>I love the phrase, "There is no distinction."</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Romans 3:22 and 23 say, "Even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>For all have sinned."</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Here it says, "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all."</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Each one must call upon the Lord, confess with his mouth, and believe in his heart before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>May the Lord be gracious to us and show us that the only way of salvation in the Bible is faith and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Salvation is not by faith plus law-keeping, good works, repentance, confession, or prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>This is the scriptural truth.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We have to stand upon the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>The Bible reveals clearly to us that the way of salvation is faith alone.</S>
