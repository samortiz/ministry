<p>We also need to be strict persons. Those who do an ordinary work are not strict persons; only rigorous persons can do a specific work. I feel that many of us are not strict enough. From our way of living and working, I can tell that we are not strict. If we learn to be strict and genuine, we will focus on the central items. It is not enough to speak on prayer in one place, persuading and moving many, and then speak on prayer in another place. We need to be willing to ask the Lord, &ldquo;Do You want me to speak this?&rdquo; This is being strict. It is easy to speak the same thing everywhere and not be strict. The Lord&rsquo;s serving ones must be strict. Loose persons cannot do a strict work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING IN THE LIGHT WE HAVE SEEN</h2>
<p>We must learn to live in the light of the truth that we have seen. What we see and live in is our specific work. We do not need to make a special effort to be specific; the truth that we see will become our specific work. If we see the cross, we will live in the cross, and the message of the cross will be our center. If we see the matter of abiding in the Lord, we will have fellowship with the Lord, and it will become our specific work.</p>
<p>This touches the matter of ministry. Our ministry is something that God has constituted into us. If we have seen the matter of breaking and have even accepted the breaking in our experience, this matter will be constituted into us to become the content of our ministry and the center of our work. Then, wherever we go, we will be able to speak about it because we have lived in, passed through, and experienced the truth that we have seen. Thus, our living and our experience will become the center of our work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING NARROW</h2>
<p>Even though our work may be specific and according to the central view, it cannot be narrow. For example, a brother may focus on the matter of being broken, but he cannot speak on this to everyone indiscriminately; this is to be narrow. We must see that there is a line in the work. For example, we may have learned the lesson of being broken over the years, but if we are sent to Hualien, the saints may not have progressed even to the point of dealing with sins, consecrating themselves, or fellowshipping with the Lord. Consequently, we cannot say, &ldquo;I have learned the matter of being broken; this is my specific work, the focus of my work, the goal of my work, and hence, I will speak on the matter of being broken.&rdquo; If the brothers and sisters do not have any understanding concerning being broken, we cannot speak of this matter first. We must first bring them to deal with their sins, to consecrate themselves, and to fellowship with the Lord. When these matters have been worked into them, we can bring them to the matter of being broken by the cross.</p>
<p>Consider the construction of a house. After the foundation of the house has been laid, pillars need to be erected to support the roof. At the site there may be roof tiles and piles of stone and wood. When a person who has a specific job of installing doors and windows arrives at the work site, he cannot install them if the pillars have not yet been erected. He can only install doors and windows once the pillars have been erected. Even if some workers cut the wood and others make neat piles of stone, the house will not be built. A building work involves more than cut wood and stones. All these items must be built together into a house in order for doors and windows to be installed. This illustrates the difference between knowing how to work and not knowing how to work.</p>
<p>Likewise, it is not possible for sisters to make a shirt if one sister sews a few stitches in one place and another sews a few stitches in another place. A knowledgeable sister, however, will know what needs to be done and even the order in which it should be done. We must see the way of the work and the stages of the work; the work has stages.</p>
<p>We must have a blueprint for the work in order to serve the Lord. When we compare the church in which we serve with the blueprint, we will see the building material that is present and the building material that is lacking. I hope that all the brothers and sisters who are consecrated to serve the Lord will pursue this point seriously. Otherwise, we will only do a dispensable work that yields dispensable results.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Manila, a well-known pastor would come to talk with me. Later, someone advised me, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, it would be good if you go to see that pastor and repay his visit,&rdquo; but I refused. I did not feel that I had received help from him, and I did not feel that I could help him. This was not a matter of pride but of having no burden to merely be involved in the reciprocation of outward civility. The reciprocation of civility may be associated with good manners, but it is akin to touching leprosy in a garment (Lev. 13:47). I also felt that the Lord&rsquo;s burden in leading me to Manila had a specific goal according to a clear blueprint, which did not involve the mere reciprocation of outward civility. The Lord&rsquo;s requirement was that I be busy with His work every day. How could I spare the time for the mere reciprocation of civility?</p>
<p>Later, others asked, &ldquo;Brother Lee, if the denominations invited you to speak, would you go?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Whether I should go or not go is not the issue. I was not sent to do such things. If I were an idle person, I would speak wherever people wanted me to speak, but I must work according to the Lord&rsquo;s commission. At work we have specific responsibilities. If someone came to you and said, &lsquo;My toilet needs to be cleaned. Would you come to my house and clean it?&rsquo; you would certainly reply, &lsquo;In my work, I need to do many things. I do not have extra time.&rsquo; Hence, it is not a matter of going or not going. The Lord&rsquo;s commission to me keeps me busy from morning to evening. How can I do other things?&rdquo; I do not criticize others for doing these things, but this is not my commission, my burden. God has sent me, and I am clear concerning what He wants me to do. Since we are consecrated to serving the Lord, we must be delivered from doing a dispensable work; otherwise, our time will be wasted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BLUEPRINT AND ITS EXECUTION</h2>
<p><em>Question: The great apostles have a blueprint; do small apostles have a blueprint as well?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Some people believe that great apostles have a blueprint, but small apostles do not. We cannot find such a thought in the Bible. The most we can say is that some apostles, such as Paul, received a blueprint directly from God, but other apostles, such as Timothy, received the same blueprint from Paul. Although Timothy was such an apostle, he did not work blindly. Paul told Timothy what kind of persons could be elders and what kind of persons could be deacons; this was a blueprint that Paul gave to Timothy. Timothy then perfected people in their function as elders and deacons; he did not work randomly.</p>
<p>In response to the situation in China thirty to forty years ago, a saying became common: &ldquo;Serving ones do not receive wages from people.&rdquo; Once this word was sounded out, many saw an opportunity to become freelance preachers, but they did dispensable works. It was easy for them to read magazines and books and preach a little here and a little there. If you asked them, &ldquo;What do you do from the beginning of the year to the end of the year?&rdquo; they would say, &ldquo;I am a preacher.&rdquo; If you asked, &ldquo;Where do you bring your saved ones?&rdquo; they would say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s business, not my business.&rdquo; The apostle Paul, however, was not so indifferent. He said, &ldquo;As a wise master builder I have laid a foundation&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:10). He knew how to build. He said also, &ldquo;I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air&rdquo; (9:26).</p>
<p>We need to cast aside any &ldquo;freelance&rdquo; work and even trample it under our feet. We should not take such a way or do such a work. The Lord has opened our eyes to see the vision, the blueprint, and we need to do what God wants us to do according to the blueprint. We should work according to the blueprint, watchfully and with fear and trembling, so that God can fulfill His purpose in us.</p>
<p><em>Question: If a brother seems to have a blueprint yet cannot get through in his work because of his flesh, is there a problem with his blueprint or his experience?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Knowing the blueprint is not a simple matter. It is quite a problem if the blueprint is incorrect; hence, it is best for brothers and sisters not to establish a blueprint on their own but with other co-workers. Even if the blueprint is correct, however, the method to carry it out may not be correct. We must be willing to study the situation. Finally, if we bring in the flesh, we will not accomplish anything no matter what we do. We are finished if we work by the flesh because the Holy Spirit has no relationship with the flesh. We all must learn to reject the flesh once we touch the Lord&rsquo;s work; dealing with the flesh is a prerequisite to all work.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Ministry, and Leading of the Lord's Serving Ones &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
