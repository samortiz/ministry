   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY TALKS 3 Date: November 22, 1935, afternoon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Chuenchow THE DEALINGS A WORKER HAS TO EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The dealings a worker has to experience are different from the dealings that ordinary brothers in the church have to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The main thing that ordinary brothers have to deal with is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The workers, however, have to deal meticulously with everything that hinders their work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Dealing with the Disposition</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first thing that a worker has to deal with is his own disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Different workers have a different character according to their natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some are righteous by disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Others are strict or shy by disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every person has his own special disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people are stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may be good in many aspects, but they have a very stubborn disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even if the whole world would say yes, they would still say no. If a person has such a disposition, he surely will have problems from time to time in his coordination among the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is difficult for such people to coordinate or work together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, every worker should find his weakness before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you do not know your weakness before the Lord, all you have to do is mark down your failures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After a few times, you will know what your weakness is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After you know your weakness, you should deal with it in a specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are not saying that a worker cannot have any weakness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are saying that he should not have any habitual weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to get rid of the peculiarities in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people have "soft" ears they believe everything they hear.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Others have "hard" ears they do not take any word easily.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are all flaws in our character, and they must all be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The circumcision in Colossians 2 refers to the cutting away of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A man who is truly dealt with by the cross may not be completely void of peculiarities, but his peculiarities surface only occasionally.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Dealing with Attitudes</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A worker must not only deal with his character, but must deal with his attitudes also.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only are his ordinary and obvious conduct and attitude noticeable to others, but his body movements and the gestures of his hands and feet are under others' scrutiny.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Others pay attention to the way he speaks, gestures, and walks, as well as to his voice, expression, and look.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One co-worker always lambasts others in his sermons because he has the habit of lambasting others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another co-worker likes to cast side-glances at others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although his eyes are perfectly normal, he has developed a habit of casting side-glances at people, which he subconsciously exhibits in his public speakings and private talks.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We the co-workers cannot give room to criticism in these areas.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not become a conversation piece, and we should not draw attention away from our message to our peculiarities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Another co-worker always points his fingers at others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is also an offensive characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a man has picked up some improprieties in his daily life, these improprieties will show up in his messages.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These undesirable characteristics must first be dealt with in a clear way in our daily lives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A handsome face may be something that one receives from God, but the expressions that are on the face are a direct product of the person's character which developed after birth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a man is always happy, he will have a joyful expression on his face all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, if a man always argues with others, he will always have an unhappy face.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A man cannot make himself look beautiful or ugly, but the expressions on his face are very much related to his living and character.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He can pick up certain expressions, and he can also get rid of these expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Of course, my purpose for saying these things is so that you will pay attention to spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not for the purpose of paying more attention to grooming yourself or adjusting your facial expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A brother in Shanghai had a fierce look when he first came to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I tried to get to know him and found out that he had a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, his complexion changed after a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He became a soft person, and his character changed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A man's facial expression is a reflection of the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One's inward character is often manifested through his facial expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Several times Miss Barber seemed to be speaking like a fortune-teller about certain brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eventually, we found out that what she said was exactly what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, a brother once took shelter in a Buddhist temple for a night.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When Miss Barber saw this brother, she said that darkness was written all over his face.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He must have been exposed to the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Later someone asked him, and he confessed to Miss Barber's words.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes I can tell a person's condition from his appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am not saying that I can predict.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A person's facial expressions are very much related to his inward condition.</S>
