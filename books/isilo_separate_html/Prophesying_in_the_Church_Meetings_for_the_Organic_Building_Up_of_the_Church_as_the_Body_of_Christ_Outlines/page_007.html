<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="17">
<li>The three constituting elements of prophesying:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must possess a knowledge of the Word of God&mdash;the human element of learning.</li>
	<li>We must have the instant inspiration of the Holy Spirit&mdash;the divine element of inspiration.</li>
	<li>We must have a vision concerning God&rsquo;s interest and economy, concerning the church as the Body of Christ, concerning the local churches, concerning the world, concerning the individual saints, and even concerning ourselves&mdash;the view through the enlightening of the divine light.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Learning and being perfected to organically prophesy (to speak the Lord into others) with the constituting elements of prophesying for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 14:4b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>By redeeming our time and spending our energy to be saturated and soaked with the holy Word to be equipped to prophesy&mdash;2 Tim. 3:16-17; Ezek. 3:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Being revived by the Lord every morning by enjoying Him in a portion of the Word:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s lovingkindnesses and compassions being new every morning&mdash;Lam. 3:22-23.</li>
			<li>The path of the righteous being as the rising sun&mdash;Prov. 4:18; cf. Luke 1:78; Mal. 4:2.</li>
			<li>Our inward man being renewed day by day&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
			<li>Anticipating the dawning of the morning with our hope in God&rsquo;s Word that we might meditate in His Word, that is, that we might receive His Word with much reconsideration&mdash;Psa. 119:147-148; cf. Lev. 11:3.</li>
			<li>Finding God&rsquo;s words and eating them for them to become the joy and rejoicing of our heart&mdash;Jer. 15:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Studying the Word by using the best help to open it, expound it, and release its unsearchable riches&mdash;the Life-study Messages and Recovery Version footnotes&mdash;Luke 24:27, 31-32, 44-45; Acts 8:30-35.</li>
		<li>Reading the Bible (&ldquo;<em>all</em> Scripture is profitable&rdquo; and &ldquo;man shall live on <em>every</em> word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo;)&mdash;2 Tim. 3:16; Matt. 4:4.</li>
		<li>Writing down daily the spiritual enlightenment, inspiration, and enjoyment received from the Lord in His Word and at the end of the week putting these points together to compose a prophecy of no longer than three minutes to speak in the church meeting.</li>
		<li>The knowledge of the Word becomes the constant element for our prophesying.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>By being ready in the spirit to receive the instant inspiration of the Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The spirits of the prophets being the most preeminent part of their being&mdash;1 Cor. 14:32, 37a.</li>
		<li>Abiding in fellowship with the Lord by walking according to our spirit&mdash;1 John 1:6-7; Rom. 8:4.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus being the Prophet in our spirit&mdash;Acts 3:22; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li>
		<li>The inspiration of the Holy Spirit is the instant element for our prophesying.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>By having a clear view with the insight to see through all things in all situations through the enlightening of the divine light:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Receiving revelation <em>only</em> in our spirit&mdash;Eph. 1:17: Rev. 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10.</li>
		<li>Having not only the dove&rsquo;s eyes ( S. S. 1:15) but also and even more, the pool&rsquo;s eyes ( S. S. 7:4):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Dove&rsquo;s eyes typifying the insight of the Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 2:11-12.</li>
			<li>Pool&rsquo;s eyes typifying the enlarged and broadened vision full of light to cover the whole universe.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Having a clear view of the entire universe to see the real situation of the world, of the churches, of our fellow believers, and of ourselves.</li>
		<li>Seeing visions of God (Ezek. 1:1) by receiving the express word of the Lord (v. 3).</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Speaking with the constituting elements of prophesying&mdash;speaking what we see with the living words of this life (Acts 5:20) under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and with His enlightenment:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Prophesying being a miraculous normality:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Normal because it requires us to learn the Word and to be trained to speak.</li>
		<li>Miraculous because it is speaking with the divine element, the divine light, and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To prophesy is to have the oracle of God (God&rsquo;s speaking, God&rsquo;s utterance, that conveys divine revelation)&mdash;1 Pet. 4:11; cf. 1 Cor. 14:24-25.</li>
	<li>When we have the human learning of the Word, the divine inspiration of the Spirit, and the clear view, we will be able to prophesy.</li>
	<li>Prophecy is always composed of the living words of this life, the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and the clear view through the enlightening of the divine light.</li>
	</ol></li>
