   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. Being a Part of Adam Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the woman had been built from his rib and brought to him, Adam exclaimed, "This time it is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh" v. 23a . In typology, this indicates that the church is a part of Christ; it is nothing less than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church, Christ's counterpart, is the element of Christ in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When this element in so many believers is added together, it equals the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the church is not a composition of people of different races, nationalities, and cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the contrary, the church is the totality of the Christ who is in all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although we are regenerated people, if we live and act according to the natural man, we are not in reality members of Christ, parts of His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A member of Christ is a person produced with the element of Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwells His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When this Christ in His believers is added together, the sum equals the church, His counterpart, which is actually a part of Christ Himself. b.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Having Come Out of Adam Christ</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eve was a part of Adam because she came out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, the church as the counterpart of Christ is a part of Christ because she has come out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 2:22a says, "And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, built he a woman" lit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>. Here we see that the rib, the bone, taken out of Adam was built into a woman, Eve, Adam's counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 5 indicates that this is a type of Christ producing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As Eve came out of the side of Adam, so the church comes out of the side of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The bone in Genesis 2 is a type of the Lord's resurrection life, which is unbreakable and which was released through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This unbreakable resurrection life is for the producing of the church, the spiritual Eve, the spiritual wife to match Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every aspect of the Lord's death was according to God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Under God's sovereignty, not one of the Lord's bones was broken John 19:31-33, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's having none of His bones broken was typified by the bones of the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the institution of the Passover, God ordained that none of the lamb's bones should be broken Exo 12:46; Num 9:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was a wonderful type.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, in Psalm 34:20 this was also prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both the type and the prophecy were fulfilled in the Lord's death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Genesis 2:21-23 we have the Scripture's first mention of "bone," which was a rib taken out of Adam for producing and building Eve as a match for Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eve was a type of the church produced with Christ's resurrection life, which was released out of Him through death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In other words, the church comes out of the resurrection life, the unbroken life, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His is the life that can never be hurt, damaged, or broken.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As Eve came out of Adam's bone, so the church comes out of Christ's resurrection life, typified by Adam's bone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eve was made from a bone, and the church is produced by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord's side was pierced, but not one of His bones was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This signifies that although the Lord's physical life was killed, His resurrection life, the divine life, could not be hurt or damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the life with which the church is produced and built.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After Eve had come out of Adam, she was presented to him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Adam said of her, "She shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man" Gen 2:23b .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This clearly reveals that Eve came out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In typology, this indicates that the church as Christ's counterpart comes out of Christ.</S>
