   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since man was made in the image of God, he possesses a good nature that matches God s nature, with virtues such as truthfulness, goodness, loveliness, wisdom, kindness, and valor.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 7:18 But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans 6:12</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fallen man is like:</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A damaged and untunable radio which cannot receive and play music, but rather meaningless noise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is also like:</S>
