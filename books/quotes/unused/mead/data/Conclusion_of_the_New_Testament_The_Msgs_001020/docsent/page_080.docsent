   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Hebrews 8:12, God will by no means remember our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means God will forget our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To forgive means to forget, for the forgetting of sins is the real forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without forgetting, forgiveness is not real.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Romans 3:24, we are "justified freely by His grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus," for God is just and justifies the one who is of the faith of Jesus v. 26 . Justification is God's action in approving people according to His standard of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's righteousness is the standard, not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No matter how righteous we are, we cannot be approved by God according to our righteousness.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can God justify us, approving us according to His standard of righteousness?</S>
