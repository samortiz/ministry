<h2 class="head1">PROBLEMS IN BEING BUILT UP</h2>
<p>If we want to be fitly joined with the saints as members of the Body of Christ and be built up together, we need to see that we have many peculiarities that keep us from bearing with one another. There is no building up if we draw near to those who suit our taste but stay away from those who do not suit our taste. However, the Lord has put us together with other saints, without regard to their origin, and He requires that we be joined and built up together with them as members of His Body. For this reason, we need to learn the lesson of dealing with our peculiarities.</p>
<p>I have had much contact with the children of God; hence, like a doctor who has much clinical experience, I know the symptoms of many spiritual peculiarities among God&rsquo;s children. Doctors know that a fever can have various causes, such as a cold, scarlet fever, or tuberculosis. Likewise, there are also many different problems that can keep those who serve the Lord from being joined and knit together with others. These problems are our peculiarities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Inclination to Be with Fellow Countrymen</h2>
<p>In order to be coordinated with the saints in the church, we first need to deal with our inclination to be with our fellow countrymen. The prominent characteristic of this inclination is language, which is a problem to building up. A brother from Shantung Province is drawn closer to another brother who speaks the same dialect. Suppose there are four elders in a locality, and three are from Foochow. During the elders&rsquo; meeting the three from Foochow might speak in their dialect at a crucial juncture in their fellowship, leaving the other elder out of the fellowship. After the three discuss the issue in their dialect, they might use Mandarin to summarize their conclusion with the elder who does not understand their dialect. In this situation there is no way for these elders to be built up. The inclination to be with one&rsquo;s fellow countrymen is an indication that a person has not been dealt with and has not learned the lesson. The Body of Christ is the new man, where there cannot be Jew nor Greek (Gal. 3:28). We must see that human distinctions must be eliminated in order to have the building up of the Body.</p>
<p>A brother who has learned the lesson will avoid speaking the Foochow dialect when he is in a meeting with saints who do not understand it. In the same way, a Taiwanese saint will avoid speaking Taiwanese when he is in a meeting with saints who do not understand Taiwanese. The use of dialects is to meet a need rather than to satisfy our particular taste and preference.</p>
<p>An inclination to be with fellow countrymen that cannot be broken will become an obstacle that prevents the church from being built up. Although a sister may know how to pray and read the Bible, her inclination to be with her fellow countrymen makes it hard for her to be built up with other saints. We are all brothers and sisters, but when we exhibit an affinity for our fellow countrymen, we are tearing down instead of building up. We should not have any distinctions in the house of God or in the Body of Christ. If we have learned the lesson in this matter, we would rather be slightly cold toward those who are our fellow countrymen and warm toward those who are not. Our relationship with the saints is not based on compatriotism; it is in the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord brought us from mainland China to Taiwan with the purpose of spreading the gospel, the truth, and His testimony among the local people. We earnestly desire that they would grow strong and eventually take this commission that we have received from the Lord so that if one day He leads us to leave here, the gospel, the truth, and His testimony will be able to go on. For this reason, we increased the gospel work among the local people and established more Taiwanese-speaking meetings in Taipei and Kaohsiung. However, I am concerned that this practice can give rise to problems, even though it does have benefits. In the church there cannot be Jew nor Greek, but for practical needs we have a Mandarin-speaking meeting and a Taiwanese-speaking meeting. Hence, the meeting of the local saints can bear a local flavor. However, such a practice might actually damage the practical building up of the church. Our meetings are divided by language for the convenience of communication. However, while we are taking advantage of this convenience, we should never approve of the distinction of languages. In the church there cannot be Jew nor Greek, that is, there cannot be Mandarin, Taiwanese, the Foochow dialect, or the Shantung dialect. Although we speak a certain language for the convenience of communication, we are not building up the testimony of a particular language; we are building up the testimony of the Body of Christ.</p>
