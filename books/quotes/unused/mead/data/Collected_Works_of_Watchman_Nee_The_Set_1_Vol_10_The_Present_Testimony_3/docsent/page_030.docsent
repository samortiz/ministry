   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Personal Preaching</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first thing we will see is the work of personal preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The power of the soul varies according to the individual's psychological condition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some people's minds are stronger than others; sometimes they can read other people's minds.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They know that in order to deal with other people it is better to know what they are thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this way they will be able to speak the right word to the right person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This natural ability to know about others is something that should be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Forgive me for using myself as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I contact someone, it is very easy for me to know what they are thinking about after two or three sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I just know, and there is no special reason why I do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I first began to work for the Lord, I thought that a natural knowledge of what others are thinking could be helpful to my work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But later I became clearer and dared not use this natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever something like this occurs, I immediately pray to resist it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every time I talk to a person, I try not to find out what he is thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One thing is certain everything that comes out of the soul or is done by the soul will not have any result.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you do something according to your soulish power, even though the other person may say he has received the help, he will not be perfected in life; in the deepest part of his being, he has not received any profit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When a person comes to you, the most important thing to do is to pray to God to show you how to help this person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should say to God, "I do not know what this person is thinking about nor what his psychological condition is; neither do I know what his spiritual condition is; I just come to You without relying on anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please give me the words."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have to lay yourself totally aside and receive your help only from God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revival Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here is another example which is most interesting: many brothers involved in the work of preaching have often told me that if they go into a chapel with dim lighting, small attendance, and many empty seats, their strength seems to disappear when they stand up to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the lights are bright, however, and there are many people sitting and waiting expectantly for them to speak, they have strength; the more they speak, the more powerful they become.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I would like to ask what kind of power this is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Frankly speaking, this is nothing other than the power of their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The power from the Holy Spirit will never be affected by any outside influences.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you want to know what preaching by the power of the soul means, just go to a big chapel, where there is a large audience with good equipment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Simply listen to the singing and watch the actions, and you will realize that there is always a special power behind a large gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But what kind of power is it?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While you are in such a place, do you not feel a power pressing on you?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What kind of power is this?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is this the power of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Most likely it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is nothing but the power of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How do we know that is the power of the soul?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just look at what the crowd is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, they may be singing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The singing is directed toward a certain direction.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Consequently, the power of all the souls is directed to one place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How great that power is!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Honestly speaking, under such circumstances, you may not be able to help them as you originally intended.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, you may be affected by them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people have come to me and talked about the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They told me how the number in the meeting and the atmosphere would help or hinder their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have always told them that the reason was that they were doing the speaking; they were speaking by their own power.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why they were affected by the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Singing Hymns</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many times, singing is helpful to God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But sometimes it becomes a soulish activity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many people like to go to the Catholic cathedrals to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They have good music.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some Catholic cathedrals have even spent more than a million dollars for an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some people say that whenever they go to a Catholic cathedral to attend a mass, in their hearts they feel that they are liberated to God's presence when they walk in and hear the sound of the organ and the choir.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These sensations are true indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you go there once, you will know what I mean.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the question is: Is this real?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Does this really lead you to God's presence?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Will just a little stirring up and attraction really release your heart and draw you to God?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Is this God's way?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I must tell you that many arrangements in the Catholic Church are from the flesh; they have no truth to them at all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They simply stir up man's mood and religious sentiment through the music and choir.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This feeling of closeness to God does not come from the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rather, it comes from the power of the songs and music.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We sing hymns also, but our faith is not in the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only the work of the Holy Spirit brings us profit; otherwise, nothing will reach our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Have you ever been to a backward countryside?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Thank the Lord, He has given me the chance to be in such places.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once I went to a village by the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Most of the people there were fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Several places nearby had believers, and they had meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In some places there were twenty to thirty people; in other places there were fifty to sixty people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whenever they came together, their singing was out of tune and disorderly.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Their singing could be off from one another by a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some would sing fast, while others would sing slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After some finished their lines, they would wait a while to allow the rest to catch up.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>How could one meet in such a situation?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He would probably run out of patience, and his power would probably also run out.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A brother told me that just listening to their singing was enough to drain his message away.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I told him that he felt this way because he had never checked if his power was from God or from himself.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Please remember a principle: we always have to look at our environment and are always influenced by our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But if something is of the Holy Spirit, we will be able to take control over our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is a very deep principle.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Let us lay hold of this principle, and let us never exercise our soulish power, lest we be controlled by the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Sometimes when the atmosphere is suppressing, God can release men through singing hymns or through praying.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But if we make singing hymns our center, we run the danger of manifesting the power of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Many people live foolishly for six days of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When Sunday comes, they go to church and listen to the singing; they are warmed up and become burning and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, where does this kind of burning and happiness come from?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I must say that there is a problem in it.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>After living foolishly and loosely for six days, they should feel their sin and should be convicted when they come to the Lord on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>How can they become burning and happy when they begin to sing?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This power is most likely not spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I do not like to be too harsh of a critic about this kind of thing, but a great deal of singing is simply a stirring up of the power of the soul.</S>
