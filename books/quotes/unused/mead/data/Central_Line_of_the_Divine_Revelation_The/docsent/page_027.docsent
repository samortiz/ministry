   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Man Being Tripartite 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A Body, Formed with the Dust of the Ground,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Be Man's Outward Organ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man was created as a tripartite being 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first of man's three parts is his body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The body was formed with the dust of the ground to be man's outward organ, having physical consciousness to contact the physical world Gen 2:7a .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All of our physical members, such as our legs, mouth, hands, and arms, are part of this outward organ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A Spirit, Formed with the Breath of God,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>to Be Man's Inward Organ as God's Recipient</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The second of man's three parts created in Genesis 2 is man's spirit v. 7b . Man's spirit was formed with the breath of God to be man's inward organ as God's recipient, having spiritual consciousness to contact the spiritual world Zech 12:1; Prov 20:27 . Proverbs 20:27 says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah." Jehovah enlightens us through our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we did not have a spirit, we would not have light or anything that would enlighten us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament the Hebrew word used most often for the spirit is ruach.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This word in Hebrew means "spirit," "breath," or "wind."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the word for spirit here in Proverbs 20:27 is not the Hebrew word ruach, but neshamah the same word used in Genesis 2:7 for breath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, according to Proverbs 20:27, the breath of life in Genesis 2:7 is the very spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God formed a spirit with the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Neshamah, the breath of life, is the source of the spirit and the element with which the human spirit was formed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The body was formed with the element of dust, and the spirit was formed with the element of the breath of life out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This breath of life out of God was not God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was not the Spirit of God, but something very close.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The source of our body is the ground, but the source of our spirit is God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our breath is nearly identical with our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without breath we would die.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet there is still a big distinction between our breath and our self.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's breath of life was not His Spirit but the very element with which God formed man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God created man by forming two things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, He formed the body with the element of the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second, He formed man's spirit with the element of His breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, our spirit is very precious because our spirit is close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The dust is not very close to God, but our spirit is very close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why in a quiet time even the atheists have something within them that says, "What if there is a God?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What will happen to me?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may say that they are atheists and teach others to be such.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But at night, something within them says, "If there is a God, what should I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This something within them is the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A few days ago the brothers distributed one hundred seventy thousand pieces of literature in Moscow and St. Petersburg formerly Leningrad in the Soviet Union, and they received twenty-four thousand names of people who wanted books and publications.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The brothers reported that there was a burning thirst within the unbelieving Russians for the truth of the gospel and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They have been under atheism for more than seventy years, yet this teaching could not change their nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No one can change their nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do have a part within them formed with the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This element remains with every human being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, it is easy for an atheist to turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The reason for this is that there is a recognizing organ the spirit within man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A Soul Being Produced by the Combination</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>of the Human Spirit and the Human Body</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The soul was the third part of man's being that was produced by God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In contrast to the body and the spirit, the soul was not formed with a certain element.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The soul was produced by the combining of the human spirit and the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The soul, comprising the mind, the emotion, and a free will, is man's self and has the psychological consciousness to contact the psychological world Gen 2:7c .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A man is a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Jacob and his family went down to Egypt, the Old Testament says that seventy souls went to Egypt Exo 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the same way, Acts 2:41 records that three thousands souls were saved on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Man is a soul, and the soul is the totality of man's body plus his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the body and spirit are put together, the total is a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This soul is man himself, comprising his mind, emotion, and free will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, the perfect man created by God is a soul with two organs, the body as the outward organ and the spirit as the inward organ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>THE CREATION OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>BEING GOD'S PRELIMINARY PREPARATION</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>FOR THE DISPENSING OF HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>AS THE TRIUNE GOD INTO THE TRIPARTITE MAN</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>ACCORDING TO HIS ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The first two chapters of the Old Testament give us a design of how God created the heavens and the earth and how He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The creation of man is God's preliminary preparation for the dispensing of Himself as the Triune God into the tripartite man according to His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the new way to study Genesis 1 and 2.</S>
