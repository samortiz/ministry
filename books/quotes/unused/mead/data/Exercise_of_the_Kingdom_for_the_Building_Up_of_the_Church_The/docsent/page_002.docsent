   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this series of messages we shall be concerned with Matthew 16, one of the greatest chapters in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter Christ is revealed in an extraordinary way, and the church is mentioned for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This chapter also speaks of such things as the gates of Hades, the keys of the kingdom, and the building of the church upon the rock with so many Peters as the stones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Matthew 16:13-28 there are at least eighteen crucial items: Christ, the church, the kingdom, the gates of Hades, the keys of the kingdom, the rock, the stone, the building of the church, the crucifixion, the resurrection, Satan, self-denial, the bearing of the cross, the losing or saving of the soul, the following of the Lord, the reward in the kingdom, the coming of the Son of Man, and the coming of the Son of Man in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message we shall deal with the revelation of Christ in Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE REVELATION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Prior to Matthew 16, the Lord had been with His disciples for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During this time, He walked with them, conversed with them, dwelt with them, and ate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result, they came to know Him very well.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, one day He took these disciples, who knew Him thoroughly, far away from the holy city and the holy temple to Caesarea Philippi, a region where the sky is clear and the atmosphere fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this atmosphere He asked them a question: Who do men say that the Son of Man is? v. 13 . They replied, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets v. 14 . All these nonsensical answers were spoken according to the natural, religious mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead of rebuking His disciples for these answers, He directed the question to them: But you, who do you say that I am? v. 15 . Then, to the surprise of the other disciples, Peter answered, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The definite article before the word Christ is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the anglicized form of the Greek word Christos, which is equivalent to the Hebrew word Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Both Messiah in Hebrew and Christos in Greek mean the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The term Messiah, the anointed One, is used in Daniel 9:26, which says, And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All Bible students agree that this refers to Jesus Christ, who is the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the Old Testament principle, anyone used by God to carry out His administration had to be anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the kings, priests, and prophets were all anointed when they came into function.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that the anointing is for the carrying out of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever God wants us to do or accomplish is related to His anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ointment with which we are anointed actually is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God anoints us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God, however, is not simple, but complex.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is triune, that is, one in three and three in one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although it is a fact that God is triune, this is a fact that no one can explain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>WATER FOR LIFE AND OIL FOR FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peter declared not only that Jesus is the Christ, but also that He is the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the anointed One, the One upon whom God has poured Himself out as the ointment to accomplish His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Bible, water, in its positive significance, indicates life, and oil indicates function.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Both water and oil are used to represent the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The difference between these two symbols of the Spirit is that the Spirit as water is for life, whereas the Spirit as oil is for function.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Spirit as water enters into you, that is for life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when the Spirit as oil is poured upon you, that is for function.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit as water getting into us is related to the Son of the living God, who is for life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit as oil poured upon us is related to the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For the fulfillment of God s administration, we have life inwardly and function outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Inwardly we have the Spirit who is water to be life to us, and outwardly we have the Spirit as oil upon us for function, for administration, and for the accomplishment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our body has both life and function.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Within our body there is life, and outwardly there are many functions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, on the one hand, God is life, and, on the other hand, He is function.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Matthew 16 we have Christ with God poured upon Him as the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the day Christ was baptized, John the Baptist saw the Spirit of God descend upon Him Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit came not as water, but as oil, because Christ was the anointed One of God for the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is both living and working.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For God to be living, there is life; but for God to be working, there is ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jesus is the Christ for God s moving and administration; He is also the Son of the living God for life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First John 5:12 says, He that hath the Son hath life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all need to look to the Lord for the heavenly revelation of these things.</S>
