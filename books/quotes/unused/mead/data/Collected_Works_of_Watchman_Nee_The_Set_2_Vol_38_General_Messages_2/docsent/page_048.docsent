   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVIL WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Third, we cannot speak evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Peter 3:9-12 says, "Not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing one another, because you were called to this, that you might inherit blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For he who desires to love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips to speak no guile.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it; for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears incline to their petition; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is one kind of word which must not come out of a Christian's mouth evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What are evil words?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are revilings and cursings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's children cannot render evil for evil or reviling for reviling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people say, "Since they said this, I can say it also."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Men are concerned about who says something first, but the Lord asks whether you have said it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may say, "Everybody is saying it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Can't I say it too?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please remember that you cannot render evil for evil or reviling for reviling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not a matter of who spoke first but a matter of whether or not you said it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have to control your temper before you can control your words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you do not control your temper, many evil words will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When God's children become loose, they speak reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we speak reviling words, we will not glorify God, nor will we receive any blessing from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BRIDLING OUR TONGUES</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>James 3 specifically touches the matter of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us read verses 1 to 12.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We will highlight a few of these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 2 says, "For in many things we all stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a man cannot bridle his words, he cannot bridle himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to see whether or not a man has self-control as a fruit of the Spirit, all one has to do is see whether he is controlled in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For a Christian, self-control means to be able to control oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ability to control oneself is a fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Galatians 5 shows us that self-control is a fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>James 3 shows us that the most obvious manifestation of this fruit of the Spirit is in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a man can control his tongue, he will be able to control his whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who speak carelessly must live a careless life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who speak in a disorderly manner must live a disorderly life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who are indiscreet with their speaking are surely indiscreet with the other faculties of their body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether or not a man is able to bridle his whole body can be seen from the way he bridles his tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brothers and sisters, if we want God to be merciful to us and touch us, we have to deal with our words.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God can deal with our words, He can deal with our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With some people, their words are the center of their whole being; their words are their backbone, the hollow of their thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order for God to deal with such persons, He must first deal with their words.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people have not been properly dealt with by the Lord because their speaking has never been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nothing exposes a person more than his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once a man opens up his mouth to speak, his whole being is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whether or not a person is able to bridle himself can be seen from the way he bridles his tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 3 uses the bridle as an illustration, while verse 4 uses the rudder as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man's tongue is like a bridle; it is also like a rudder.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is something very small, yet it can affect a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 5 says that a little fire can ignite a forest, then verse 6 says, "And the tongue is a fire; the very world of unrighteousness, the tongue is set among our members as that which contaminates the whole body and sets on fire the course of life and is set on fire by Gehenna."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The tongue is a world of its own, a world of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many people have not been dealt with in the matter of their tongue, and the tongue brings them into a world of unrighteousness; they spread death everywhere and set aflame the fire of Gehenna.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is a very strong word here: The tongue can set the course of life on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that it can produce many activities of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man's flesh, temper, and anger can all be lit up by the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The tongue can set aflame the fire of Gehenna.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many evil things are stirred up through one word; such a word is truly from Gehenna.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The tongue is a fire and a world of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we want to save ourselves from blemishes in our speaking, we must learn to bridle our words.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who open their mouths often inevitably make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many proverbs repeatedly advise men to be discreet with their words.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is foolishness to be talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more foolish a man is, the more he has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the more a man learns his lessons before the Lord, the more discreet he becomes and the less he has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verses 7 and 8 tell us that every creature can be tamed but no one is able to tame the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must realize how foolish it is to unbridle our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verses 9 to 12 say that we cannot bless the Lord and curse the men whom He has created with the same tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We cannot bless and curse at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A spring cannot gush forth sweet and bitter water out of the same opening.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A fig tree cannot produce olives, and a vine cannot produce figs.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Neither can salt water produce sweet water.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A certain kind of tree bears a certain kind of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A certain kind of spring gushes forth a certain kind of water.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those whom God uses will surely gush forth sweet water which will not have any bitter taste to it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God's way of salvation is to put a new spring within us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is saving us by making us a new tree.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we are a fig tree, we will surely not produce olives, and if we are a vine, we will surely not produce figs.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once God puts a new life within us, we will gush forth sweet water spontaneously.</S>
