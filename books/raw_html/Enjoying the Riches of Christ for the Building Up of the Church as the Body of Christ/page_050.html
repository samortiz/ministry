<h2 class=head2>To Prophesy Not Mainly Being to Predict</h2><p>In all the writings of the apostle Paul we can find only a few predictions. Nearly the only predictions in all of Paul’s writings are some prophecies of the Lord’s coming back (1 Cor. 15:51-52; 1 Thes. 4:15-17; 5:1-3; 2 Thes. 2:1-10). Today in the Pentecostal or charismatic meetings there are many predictions. Many such prophecies begin with, “Yea My people, thus saith the Lord.” When I came to this country, I was surprised to learn that regardless what language the speaker used, whether Chinese, Filipino, or English, the tone of this kind of speaking was the same, and the wording was nearly the same. To prophesy in the New Testament does not mainly mean to predict. In the entire book of Acts there are only two predictions. In chapter eleven there was a prediction that there would be a famine over the whole inhabited earth (vv. 27-30), and in 21:8-11 one predicted that Paul would be arrested and bound if he went to Jerusalem. In all the Epistles of the apostles there are nearly no predictions other than certain prophecies of the coming back of the Lord Jesus.<h2 class=head2>The Problem of False Predictions</h2><p>In the charismatic meetings there are predictions after predictions. Nearly all these predictions were never fulfilled. In 1963 on the West Coast I saw a mimeographed booklet with a prophecy that there would be a great earthquake in the following year which would cause Los Angeles to go down into the ocean. The prophecy warned people to go to the mountains to dig caves to live in. Some took the warning and moved away, but 1964 came and nothing happened. Then after 1964 they predicted the same thing again. This prediction was even put into the newspapers in Los Angeles and San Francisco. People talked much about it, but nothing happened. The tongue-speaking movement along the West Coast was very much cooled down by this false prophecy. People were no longer fooled by it.<p>In a certain city this kind of movement became active among us. It was prevailing to the extent that the leading ones in the church there came to me about it. I told them, “There is no other way than to go to the Lord. Call on the Head as the authority. Let the Lord vindicate His way.” They prayed in this way, and something happened. The prevailing one in this kind of prophesying was a sister. One day a dear sister among us suddenly died of tuberculosis. She was a lovely sister, and the whole church loved her. The prevailing, tongue-speaking sister immediately made a prediction and told the husband not to prepare a funeral. She said the sister would be resurrected the following day at noon. This false prophecy was devilish. On the next day before noontime all the saints crowded into that house to see the resurrection. The sister who prophesied went into the room with two elders to pray desperately. Then noontime came and nothing happened. By three o’clock still nothing had happened. Then one of the three elders said, “Brothers and sisters, we should no longer listen to this. Let us prepare a funeral for our sister.” The husband agreed to this. The brother sent certain ones to prepare a place and buy a coffin, and the crowd left. That was the end of this movement. The whole church was rescued, and all the saints came back to the regular meetings of the church.<h2 class=head2>The Scriptural Meaning of Prophesying</h2><p>In the New Testament and in the whole Bible, prophesying first means to tell for, to speak something for, the Lord. Second it is to tell forth, to make a declaration. Third it is to foretell, to tell beforehand. The latter is a prediction, but this is not the main meaning of prophesying. To prophesy mainly means to tell for or tell forth. This is not only so in the New Testament Epistles; it is also so with the Old Testament prophets such as Isaiah and Jeremiah. Isaiah contains much telling for and telling forth the Lord, although, of course, there is also some foretelling. It is difficult to find many predictions in the New Testament, but there is much telling, speaking something for the Lord Jesus, and much telling forth, declaring something to people about the Lord’s doing. There is relatively little of the third kind of prophesying.<p>Based upon this, we may see what it is to prophesy in the meetings. It is to speak something for the Lord, to tell forth something of the Lord. A brother should stand up and strongly say, “Praise the Lord! Today the Lord Jesus has been constantly my strength.” This is to prophesy. The brother tells something for the Lord Jesus, and at the same time he also tells forth, he declares something about the Lord Jesus. Then a sister may stand up and say, “Hallelujah! Today Jesus was my Lord in my kitchen.” This is both telling for and telling forth. This is the proper prophecy.<p>We cannot pick up a word such as prophesy in an isolated way to define it. This is dangerous. We have to take care of the whole context of 1 Corinthians. This book tells us that Paul the apostle, as an example of functioning in the meetings, determined not to know anything but Christ, and he did this with a strong spirit, a demonstration of the Spirit, not in an unknown tongue but in clear words. He said, “But in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue” (14:19). This is the proper way to prophesy in the meetings.<p>To be sure, we can all prophesy in this way. If to prophesy were to predict something, I am afraid that throughout the whole year none of us would prophesy. We would come together again and again, waiting for inspiration, but no inspiration would come. Eventually, we would be forced to make some false predictions such as of a great earthquake in Los Angeles. To prophesy in the meetings is simply to tell something for the Lord, to tell forth something about the Lord. We must declare to the universe, to all the principalities and powers in the heavenly places, that the Lord Jesus is our life. Today He was with us all the time, in our kitchen, our dining room, our living room, and even when we went shopping. This is prophesying. It is so simple, yet so practical and profitable.<p>If we pray-read all the verses in this message and review all the points which we have covered and put them into practice, we will see something. When we come together, it is wonderful to speak something for Christ by exercising our spirit. We say something for Christ with the demonstration of the Spirit, not in a weak, timid way, but in a strong way. We have a strong spirit, so living and so aggressive, and we have some experiences of Christ to tell others. We do have something of Christ to speak about, to declare. Therefore, when we come to the meeting, we exercise our spirit to say something for Christ, to say something about Christ. You say something. I say something. Everybody says something. This will have a convincing impact on others.
