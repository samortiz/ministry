   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see the truth concerning the unique ministry of God s New Testament economy and many personal ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s New Testament ministry is unique, but there are many personal ministries within this unique ministry.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can all be perfected to be apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the ministries, however, must be in the unique ministry of the New Testament.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first kind of apostle includes those like Peter, John, and Paul who were appointed directly by the Lord and constituted directly through the Lord s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Other brothers like Timothy, Titus, and Silas composed another kind of apostle.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He went to a brother to get the list of these seven apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I looked at this list and considered the names, I realized that all of the seven were my students.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They all learned of me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am not likening myself to Paul, but the principle is the same.</S>
