   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONDITION OF CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, the view of Christianity today concerning the Bible is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lutherans do not put much emphasis on the growth in life and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They consider that once a person believes in the Lord, he is justified, but they do not pay much attention to the organic aspect of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, proponents of the reformed theology also do not care for the matters of growth in life and transformation, which they consider too troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, they think that once a person believes in the Lord, he receives a salvation that is eternally secured.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has chosen us once in eternity and that is sufficient and will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Their teaching comes short of the divine revelation in the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot say that there is nothing more after God's choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians 1:4 indeed says that we were chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But Ephesians does not have only this one verse.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ephesians 1 has many more verses telling us that there are still many things after God's choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, we simply cannot say that God's choosing is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>People in the Pentecostal movement also neglect the matters of growth in life and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They consider that it is more important to speak in tongues and that a person cannot be saved without speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the condition of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not know the organic matters in God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only so, many people in Christianity do not know that the Lord as the Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They even do not know what the Spirit is, nor do they know that there is a spirit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They consider the spirit and the soul as one and synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only so, they mix up the heart, the soul, and the spirit, considering them synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This condition of Christianity today is incurable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All we can do is wait for the Lord to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to Revelation 17, when the Lord comes back, the first thing He will do is burn the Catholic Church with fire v. 16 ; next, He will command the angels to bind into bundles all the false Christians, the tares, in Christianity and cast them into the lake of fire Matt 13:30, 41-42 . Third, He will gather all the genuinely saved ones to His judgment seat; there He will judge them to see whose living and work are gold, silver, and precious stones and whose living and work are wood, grass, and stubble 1 Cor 3:12-15; 4:4-5; 2 Cor 5:10; Rev 22:12 . If the living and work are wood, grass, and stubble, the Lord will burn these things with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, only a small amount of gold, silver, and precious stones will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord has shown me these truths after my studying of the Word for seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, I feel so pained when I look at the condition of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without the Lord's mercy, the Lord's recovery may have two kinds of conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One condition is to be like that of Sardis, that is, living in name but dead in reality Rev 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The other condition is to be like that of Laodicea, that is, neither hot nor cold v. 16 . Being living in name and yet dead and being neither hot nor cold were our condition several years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That is why in 1984 I went to Taiwan to study the Lord's new way for His recovery to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today in the Lord's recovery, generally speaking, we have come out of the conditions of Sardis and Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But we need to be humble lest some fall into such conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now we will go on to see the sanctification in the divine nature and the Spirit's renewing of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Positional Sanctification Belonging to the Judicial Aspect of God's Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, we must know the difference between positional sanctification and dispositional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The former belongs to the judicial aspect of God's salvation, whereas the latter belongs to the organic aspect of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before we were saved, we were altogether in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After we were saved and regenerated, the Lord completely separated us to make us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is positional sanctification for the believers to be separated out of the world and made holy unto God 1 Cor 1:2; Rom 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As mentioned in Matthew 23, when the gold is placed in the market, it is something common, but when it is placed in the temple, it is sanctified v. 17 . This kind of sanctification does not change at all the inward disposition; it changes only the outward position.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every regenerated person more or less has this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Immediately after we were saved, we simply did not want to mingle with those in the world; we had been separated from them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is positional sanctification, separation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This positional sanctification is through the redeeming blood of Christ Heb 10:29; 13:12 for the believers to become God's peculiar people 1 Pet 2:9-10 and notes .</S>
