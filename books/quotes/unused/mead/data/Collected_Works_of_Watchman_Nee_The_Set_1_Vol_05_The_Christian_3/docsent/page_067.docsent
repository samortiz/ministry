   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At the same time, we see that those Laodiceans whose eyes are strictly set on material things are boasting of their new inventions.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I do not say that these are the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To these ones, everything is man-made.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even Christianity is but an advanced notion of man concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They worship man and boast of the greatness of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In reality they are worshipping themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They receive everything that comes from man but will not receive anything from Christ except His name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What they have and what they emphasize are the false and human things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They boast not only in their material riches and the culture of the twentieth century but are most proud of their wisdom, knowledge, and the abundance of their education.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, they think that they have a more perfect explanation of Christianity than others do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These liberal idealists boast of their scientific knowledge; they think that their judgments are right.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, we know that both archaeology and other sciences have refuted these groundless critics.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They try their best to overturn the fundamental doctrines of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They want to change Christianity from a religion to a social philosophy or a moral system.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They regard all supernatural things as unbelievable because science considers them impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They think that man is almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The human life that Christ has forever condemned on the cross is considered by them as potentially strong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If it is developed, it will become like Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their errors and blasphemies are so numerous that it wears me out to enumerate them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But what is the conclusion of their teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They say that their intellect, their mind, and their mental power will guide them to determine what is God's word, what really happened thousands of years ago, and what will happened in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They can tell the past and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They can tell how the world will evolve.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They boast forever of the superabundant riches of modern man and of the science, philosophies, and cultures of the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these are things that they speak of.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They indeed "have need of nothing"!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whichever kind of Laodicean one may be, the principle is the uplifting of oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the sin of Adam and is also the sin of all men throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, everyone who truly wants to be the Lord's disciple must deny himself and must bear the cross, so that the self that has been denied will never come back and that he may follow the Lord single-heartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Laodicea is the totality of self-exaltation throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is one of the greatest signs of the end time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The world will be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So will the nominal church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such things happen because the spirit of the antichrist has been stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are two characteristics of Laodicea: supposing oneself to be rich and being lukewarm towards Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have heard many truths; this is why they think that they are rich spiritually speaking .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They pay much attention to the mental understanding of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This kind of outward knowledge of God is a catalyst for the coming of the end time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God will judge everything that bears His name in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All that these ones strive for is what the world now admires and commends.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, they are not worth anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the flesh is being worshipped in the church, that which is spiritual and godly will not be able to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Never think that there are no good ones within this church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What the Lord is dealing with here is not individuals, but the church, although individuals may be taught through this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord said that He will spew this church out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If one has Laodicea in his motive, it is difficult to avoid the spirit of Laodicea when the majority is turned toward it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Vainglory is often the chief instigator of Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The love of fame will often lead one to Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's children must answer before the Lord if they are what Laodicea typifies.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are they living for Christ, or are they only utilizing Christ's name?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"And do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"And do not know!"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What a contrast between their self-esteem and Christ's evaluation!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ knows their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This exhibition of their real condition seems to be harsh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yet it is most necessary, for the root of sin here is self-boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no foolishness more serious than the foolishness of self-ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only a jolting, thunderous revelation of this fact will awaken Laodicea from its comfortable dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The overcomers are often preserved through preaching the words that no one welcomes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, what Laodicea needs is the two-edged sword.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord's word here is not the declaration of a detective, but the diagnosis of a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Of course, if these ones do not take heed to this word, they will suffer the verdict of a judge and the punishment of an executor.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Laodicea's condition is more pitiful than others in that it does not know itself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those who do not know themselves will surely boast.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We cannot find one person who knows himself and uplifts himself as Laodicea did.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When believers have learned to realize their own corruption, they feel ashamed of themselves and loathe and hate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They only worry that the self is not yet fully removed and has not yet completely died.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They do not dare to put themselves in an exalted position anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only those who do not know shame would glory in their own shame.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Why have they fallen to such a condition?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is because they do not receive the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's word always causes man to feel empty; it always humbles a man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The work of the Holy Spirit often causes man to realize the corruption and hopelessness of his flesh and leads man to the cross and to judge and reject himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>"And do not know that you are wretched."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The word "you" in the original language is emphatic.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is you, the self-contented you, who is wretched.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Why is this so?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is because all that it is saying is about itself.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It never mentions anything about Christ or what He has done for it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For this reason, it is most wretched.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Often we think that a man is wretched only when he feels his wretchedness in a wretched environment.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But here, they do not feel wretched about themselves at all.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Others have to come to tell them this.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The reason for this is that their spiritual senses are close to being dead.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What is this wretchedness?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>First, it is their spiritual humiliation; they are no longer able to have spiritual joy.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Second, they will lose the glory and will be in outer darkness in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There they will see that they are outside the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>At that time, they will realize their wretchedness.</S>
