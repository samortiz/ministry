<h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>God sows with the purpose of reaping a harvest. Let us now consider the principle of God's harvesting.</p><p>John 12:24 says, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." This word refers to the Lord dying for us and dispensing His life into us. The pathway to a harvest is through death. One must pass through the cross. God sows with the goal of gaining some fruit; His goal is for the one grain of wheat to bear many grains. God did not send one prophet or many prophets to men to expound the word clearly. In sending His Son, God made Him the one grain. Only when this one grain fell into the ground did many grains come forth. Fruit-bearing does not come through a clear exposition of the word or through the hard memorization of the Scriptures. When the seed falls into the ground many grains are brought forth. This is the work of the cross.</p><p>The cross is a fact; it is not a doctrine. If there is indeed death, there will indeed be fruit. If there is no death, there will be no fruit. The measure of death determines the measure of life. The number of blows one suffers determines the measure of the outflow of life.</p><p>No doubt verse 24 refers to the Lord Himself. But in verse 25, He gives us a word of explanation. His word speaks of a principle that not only applies to Himself but also applies in general. "He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life." This word is for everyone. Verse 26 says, "If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me." This makes it more clear; everyone who serves Him has to go through the same experience. The falling of the grain into the ground to die does not refer to redemption (in which we can never have a part) but to the removal of the self-life. The principle is that death brings in life. This is what Paul meant when he said that death operated in him and life in others (2 Cor. 4:12).</p><p>Hence, it is not enough for us to be a seed; we must know the way to bear fruit. The way to bear fruit is not by preaching or teaching; the way to bear fruit is by sowing. God did not send His Son to the earth to preach the word; He sowed His Son as a seed into the ground. Today He is also sowing us here and there as seeds.</p><p>A seed must fall into the ground to die before it can bear much fruit. Before a grain of wheat falls into the ground, it has an outward shell. This shell protects the grain from any harm, yet it also frustrates it from bringing forth many grains. If the outward shell is not broken, the life within will not be released. When the grain is put into the ground and the water and the soil act on it organically, the shell soon breaks and decays, and the life within is released. The Lord is the one grain that fell into the ground and died. When this grain died, it brought forth many grains. From death unto life&mdash;this is the way with the Lord, and this is the way with us. Fruit-bearing through death&mdash;this is the way with the Lord, and this is the way with us. Hence, the principle of fruit-bearing is not preaching but death. Once we touch a person, we immediately know whether or not he has fallen into the ground to die. In order to know whether or not a person has died, we only have to find out whether the shell still remains. Much of our hardness is natural hardness, and much of our softness is natural softness. Whether it is hard or soft, as long as it is a shell, it frustrates the outflow of life and prevents men from touching the life within. Only the work of the cross will remove the outer shell from us. It is very difficult to touch a person who has not been broken. After one speaks to such a person for an hour, he still feels that there is a great distance between them. With him, there is a shell. But a person who has been smitten, stricken, and broken by God will have his natural and soulish elements shattered. When others touch him, they will touch life. Only those who have fallen into the ground and died will bear fruit! Only those who have passed through death will bear fruit before the Lord. Without passing through death, there cannot be fruit. There may be hundreds and thousands of people following you, but you may still have no fruit before the Lord. The principle of fruit-bearing is to die and then to bring forth many grains. If one does not die, he remains one grain. If a grain of seed has not passed through death, it will not bring forth any fruit.</p><p>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we can become the seed of God and fall into the ground and die, and so that He can gain fruit in us.</p>
