   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO TURN FROM THE SOUL TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fellowship of life is in the spirit because fellowship is of life, and life is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we are saved, we lived in the soul, that is, in the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We cannot be separated from the soul; our very person lives in the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the fellowship of God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in order to touch the fellowship and learn to fellowship, we need to turn our being from the mind, emotion, and will to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How do we turn from our will to our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A certain saint may decide to go to Bangkok, but even though this decision has been made, he should be willing to let go of it and not insist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As he turns to his innermost part, prostrating himself before God and quieting himself, he should not think about Bangkok or his decision.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, he should simply turn from his will to his spirit to touch the sense of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, he will learn how to turn from his will to the spirit to touch the feeling of the spirit in this matter specifically.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there is a sense in his spirit to go to Bangkok, that will be very good; however, if the spirit has another feeling, he must learn to let go of his decision, turn from his will, and obey this inward sense.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not a simple lesson, but it is a lesson we need to learn throughout our entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE OUTER MAN DECAYING AND THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BEING RENEWED DAY BY DAY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The matter of turning to the spirit to fellowship with God, or we can say the matter of living in the fellowship and living in the spirit, is not a matter that we can learn by simply making up our minds.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a need for the hand of God to break our being outwardly; that is, there is a need for the Spirit of God to arrange the outward environment to break and consume our being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word consume comes from 2 Corinthians 4:16, which says, Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Greek word for decaying may also be rendered being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although our outer man is decaying and being consumed, our inner man is growing and being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This consuming is the breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Decaying in verse 16 is God s dealing in verses 8 through 11.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 7 the apostle Paul says, We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all know that earthen vessels refers to us; we are made of clay and are earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Earthen vessels does not refer merely to our body but to us; this treasure refers to God and His life, that is, Christ and His life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have this treasure in earthen vessels means that we have Christ in us, that is, in our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our inner man is Christ; our outer man is we ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, verse 16 says, Our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that while we are being broken by God, Christ is being built up in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE SOUL BEING THE OUTER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>AND THE SPIRIT BEING THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The outer man, physically, is our body; psychologically, it is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The outer man is our soul, that is, our self.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The outer man being consumed means that our self is being consumed; that is, our mind, emotion, and will are being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A brother may have a great intellect, a strong mind, and clear thinking, but all of these can frustrate the pneumatic Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, God will raise up an environment to deal with his mind and thought; this is the tearing down.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before he was dealt with by God, his thinking was always sharp, and his clear mind could reason out everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when he comes under the hand of God, the outcome is always a mess even though his thoughts are right.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is God s striking him in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He thinks that it is good to do things in a certain way, yet the result is altogether a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He thinks that he will be successful if he does things in a certain way, yet it turns out to be a complete failure.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is God s striking and tearing down of his mind with His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not think that this is a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people are smitten severely in God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such a dealing tears down his mind to the extent that when he encounters another matter, he does not dare rely on his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This can be compared to the situation of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At one time his legs could run very well; moreover, he had a mind that was able to think of many ways to fight and supplant.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His mind was clever, resourceful, and full of schemes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day, however, God met him and dealt with him severely, touching his hip and crippling him Gen 32:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After this, Jacob could no longer run.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some people who are intelligent and have a very clever mind use their mind in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such ones do not know how to touch the feeling of God, nor do they know how to live in the spirit rather than in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead, they allow their mind and intellect to take the lead in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When God begins to deal with them, especially with their mind and intellect, they may become confused and scared, and they lose their confidence in their thinking ability.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When they encounter similar situations in the future, their spirit will spontaneously occupy the leading position.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>With respect to their mind, their outer man is torn down, but their inner man is being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the same principle, God strikes our emotion to the extent that it fails us, and we no longer have any confidence in it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At such a time, our spirit will spontaneously occupy the leading position and have preeminence over our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is the same with our will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God s striking and tearing down are a very painful process.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even the apostle Paul was no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 2 Corinthians 4:7-12, Paul says, We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are pressed on every side but not constricted; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out; persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>So then death operates in us, but life in you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The treasure is Christ who is in us, the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When God raises up an environment so that we are pressed on every side and cast down, the death of Jesus begins to operate in us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The word death in Greek does not refer to an ordinary death; it means killing, putting to death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For someone to be put to death is for him to be put into a situation of constantly being killed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A sister may love her daughter very much, but she loves only with her emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If God desires this sister to grow in spirit, He must stretch out His hand to deal with her emotional love for her daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is a putting to death, a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We also may be very clever, relying on our mind in everything we do, rather than the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Consequently, God will raise up one situation after another to kill our cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is a genuine experience, and it is not only painful but also long lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, Paul says that the putting to death of Jesus operates in us so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our body.</S>
