Brother Yin Ke-chu went with me. The Lord revived several of the people and saved several entire families together with some sinners. This spring I worked there again for a total of sixteen days. The number in the meetings every Lord's Day is approximately fifty or sixty. The Lord saves, the Spirit works, and we are just empty vessels. After working in Chien-Ji, I was led by the Lord to go to Hwi-Dun. This place is about fifty or sixty miles from the city. Three or four years ago, there was no one there to testify for the Lord. Then a sister in the Lord was persecuted for the Lord's sake, and His name was made manifest. The Lord continued by raising up two brothers and five sisters to testify for Him. When I arrived, I had the burden to preach the gospel. I did so every afternoon, conducting some edification and prayer meetings in the evenings. They were all under the Lord's blessing. Twenty to thirty people are clear about their salvation. There are more women than men. This is the first proper beginning of the work in Hwi-Dun. Thank and praise the Lord for this!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chiu Ri-jien<br />April 3</p><p>Please send all letters and books to my home in Soo-Jia-Tsui, Lien-Shui County, Kiangsu.</p><h2 class="head2">The Gospel among the Miao Tribe,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><p>Pu Men is in the southernmost area of Ping-Yang. It is a small country village among the steep peaks of the high mountains. It is rarely visited by workers. (The workers only go to Fang-Yen-Hsia and Yi-Shan in Jiang-Nan. It is not that they are unfair, but the roads are difficult. However, there is a more convenient way of taking the steamer up Sha River and disembarking in Hsia-Guan.) There are four assemblies here. However, there is a lack of people doing the watering, so it is very difficult to go on. What a pity! During the past two years, the area has been directly and indirectly controlled by bandits, but we have all been safe under God's protection. Thank Him. God opened a new way for us during the Chinese New Year gospel conference. We went to preach the gospel to the Miao tribe. There are three areas where these people live: Niu-Pi-Ling, Fu-Jang, and Hua-Yang. (Of course, there are also others who are scattered elsewhere. Hua-Yang belongs to Fukien. It is in the northernmost part of the province.) The closest is about twenty miles from Ma-Tsan, and the farthest is thirty miles away. The mountain roads are steep and dangerous. The steep paths are difficult to travel, and this area is very backward. These tribesmen have never heard the gospel. (We really have sinned against the Lord and them as well.) For years this has been a stronghold of bandits. A few of us went with Brother Lin Sheng-wu. After praying, we went out first to Niu-Pi-Ling. They were like birds scared of a bow because they had been harassed and harmed by bandits the year before. They were suspicious of us and dared not receive us. We managed to rent a house from them. During the day we preached the gospel door to door and gave them our individual testimonies. They were afraid to even take gospel tracts. In the evening we held gospel meetings. At first fifty or sixty people came to listen to the word. Later, the numbers decreased. Most were merely curious. Although they did not seem to have a heart, we were not discouraged. We believe that the Lord will not make our work vain. Later, we went to Fu-Jang and Hua-Yang. The people in these two places live closer together, so it was easier to contact them. We worked in the same way. Thank the Lord that He Himself worked. They listened solemnly to Brother Lin's preaching (even a broken vessel helps) and were touched. More than ten desired to believe. Unfortunately, the road is far, so they cannot have frequent contact with us. In the last two weeks, five have come to Ma-Tsan to listen to the word. We pray and hope that a church can soon be established in that locality so that the hundreds of surrounding homes would not perish (3 John 2).</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Fan Pei-jen<br />April 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_116.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_118.html">Next</a> </body></html>
