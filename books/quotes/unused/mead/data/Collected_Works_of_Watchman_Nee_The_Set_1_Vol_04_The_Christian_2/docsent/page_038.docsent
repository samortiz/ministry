   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse Four</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 4:"But I have one thing against you, that you have left your first love."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Chinese Union Version translates this verse as: "But I have one thing against you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This softens the tone of the Lord and gives the impression that the Lord's rebuke was a light one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we think that the Lord was only against them in this one thing, we may think that what the Lord was against was not something too serious.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, the Lord was greatly grieved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To forget the Lord's love and to receive this love in vain is not a small failure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is all the more serious since they had tasted of this love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they had left the first love at this point, would they not leave their present work in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The greatest degradation for a saint, and for a church as well, is to leave the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first step of degradation a saint or a church takes is to depart from the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is true that our Lord praises much, but He has a high standard too.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although He commended them so much, it does not mean that they were without reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our Lord rebukes those whom He praises the most.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His goal is perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not enough to have a good start.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to go on according to the original condition and must advance even further.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their traditional works and judgments were still there, but their motivating power was not as strong as before.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A man can work as before while losing the original motive for his work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A church can be zealous and active outwardly, having the pure faith and the proper judgment, yet gradually losing the love which is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From the world's view and even from one's own view, one may be excellent and display no trace of decline.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But from the view of the Lord who searches the inward parts and the hearts, the source of sins unseen by men is detected.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Can a bridegroom be satisfied if a bride is faithful in all duties but cold in love?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Can a person hungry for love be satisfied by good works and diligence?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Can a love as great as Christ's be satisfied by cold activities and dry works that are void of a burning love?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord is jealous of our love!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Love demands love, and short of it, no outward diligence can compensate for its loss.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus had done His best to praise the Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This shows His love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, He could not skip His rebuke just because of the praises.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was commendable that they continued in their works, but the firstfruits of grace, such as the denial of oneself and the minding of Christ, were gone!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this the Lord was against them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the spiritual life of a saint, there is nothing that can replace a perfect heart for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the heart is gone, what else can please the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Can sounding brass and clanging cymbals 1 Cor 13:1 serve the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They had left the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason they could continue to work might have been that the work had become a habit or that the work might have retained a good name for them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, a vain outward appearance cannot deceive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord requires from us the very thing in which we fail.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What then is the "first love"?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When a man obtains a new thing, what joy there is!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A new thing seems to have a special power to lay hold of a person and to give him an unspeakable feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How earnest a man's heart is towards the Lord Jesus Christ when he first receives Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How grateful such a one is when he considers the pain and slavery under sin and Satan, and the salvation of the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man is prone to love new things and dislike old things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord wants us to consider Him as the ever-fresh One.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many have shed countless tears of gratitude when they came to know the salvation of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, they condemn themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the other hand, they marvel at the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At such times, they are willing even to die and to be burned for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How intense the "first love" is!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Unfortunately, such a condition does not remain long.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When circumstances change, although one may not be completely dead towards the Lord, the initial virgin heart for the Lord is defiled and stained through enticement from the world and incitement of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Formerly the heart burned for the Lord and was sick with love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now the heart is as dead as ashes and has lost the first love!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The first love is completely satisfied with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All those who are filled with the first love have one characteristic, which is that they seem to have been charmed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"For whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God" 2 Cor 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord told us many times that He satisfies our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever" John 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"He who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst" John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" John 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who are filled with the Lord's love are peculiar in man's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They are not like those in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They do not care for gain or loss, mocking or rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we have gained the smile of the Lord on the throne, who can make us sorrowful with their frowning faces?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Man can have the world.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He can have fame, adulation, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But what we want is just the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the meaning of the apostle's word in Philippians 3: "But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because of such a desire for Christ, he was able to mind only "one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>How different is this kind of work from the work which is content with what meets the eyes!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the secret of happiness!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Since Paul was willing to consider all things as refuse for Christ's sake, the Lord surely rewarded him with a surpassing and extraordinary joy.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Those who can refuse the joy of the world will overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The world is behind; the reward is ahead, and the feet are closely pursuing after the glorious way of the heavenly light.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How can any person, event, or matter of this world attract us any more?</S>
