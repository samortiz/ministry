   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>N. Considering It</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition to musing upon the Word of God, the psalmist also considered it 119:95 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In our spiritual experience we also consider the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Throughout the day we may consider what we enjoyed in our musing upon the Word in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By recalling our enjoyment of the Lord in the Word, we receive further nourishment from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>O. Esteeming It</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Right concerning All Things</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The psalmist also esteemed God s Word right concerning all things v. 128 . The word right here does not mean right as opposed to wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It means upright, straight, strict in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we muse upon the Word and consider it, we shall regard it upright in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>P. Entering into It</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 130 says, The entrance of thy words giveth light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we enter into God s Word, we see light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Hebrew word for entrance means an opening, a gate, and it implies entering in. God s Word has an entrance through which we may get into it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us learn to enter into the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Light is not outside the Word; it is in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we enter into the Word of God, we shall be in the light that shines there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Q. Learning It</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we enter into the Word, we learn the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 73 indicates that God has created us in such a way that we may have understanding of His Word and learn His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 71 says, It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This verse indicates that God raises up circumstances to discipline us so that we may learn the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through suffering and affliction we learn His law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Inwardly we have faculties created by God by which we can understand His Word, and outwardly we have the environment and the circumstances by which we are disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God allows us to be afflicted so that we may learn the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>R. Treasuring It</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The psalmist also treasured the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He treasured it as great spoil v. 162 , as all riches v. 14 , above thousands of gold and silver vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>72, 127 , and as a heritage forever v. 111 . Spoil refers to valuables taken away from an enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we muse upon the Word, the enemy will be defeated, and we shall gather much spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we shall become rich and possess gold and silver, which will become our heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In ancient times, when a king conquered his enemies, he seized the gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Likewise, when we enjoy the Word and defeat the enemy through the Word, we shall gain spoil from the conquered enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we shall have the riches, the gold and silver, and the heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some may complain that what I have said about treasuring the Word of God is too experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not understand the matter in this way, how should we treasure the Word as our spoil?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to muse upon the Word and experience victory over the enemy through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we shall have the spoil, the spoil will be our riches, the riches will be our gold and silver, and this will become our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I can testify that, for the most part, my inheritance has come to me in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the enemy is defeated through the Word, I gain gold and silver as my heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>S. Hiding It in Their Heart</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 11 says, Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Treasure should be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, many people like to display their wealth instead of concealing it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This way is not the biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the Bible, we should hide our treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should treasure God s Word and hide it in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>T. Remembering It and Not Forgetting It</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 52 indicates that the writer of Psalm 119 remembered God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we hide the Word in our heart, we shall remember it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To remember the Word is to call back, to recall, our enjoyment of it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The psalmists certainly were busy in handling the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They mused upon it, considered it, hid it in their heart, and remembered it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In verse 16 the psalmist declares, I will not forget thy word, and in verse 93 he says, I will never forget thy precepts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to exercise ourselves not to forget the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is difficult to remember the Word, but it is easy to forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may hear many rich messages from the Word and in a very short period of time forget them all.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, we need to exercise ourselves to remember God s Word and not forget it.</S>
