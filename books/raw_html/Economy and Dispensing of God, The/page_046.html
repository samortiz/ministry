<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN RELATION<br>TO THE ORGANIC BUILDING<br>OF THE CHURCH OF GOD<br>AS THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:1-22; 3:1-12, 14-19</H1><P>In this chapter we will see the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the producing, the building up, and the existence of the church. We will also see the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in Christ's making His home in the believers' hearts that they would be filled unto all the fullness of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN PRODUCING<br>THE CHURCH AS GOD'S MASTERPIECE (POEM)<br>AND IN BUILDING UP THE CHURCH,<br>WHICH IS THE NEW MAN AND THE BODY,<br>AS GOD'S DWELLING PLACE IN OUR SPIRIT</H2><P>First, I would like to call your attention to a few terms that are used in Ephesians to describe the church. The church is the Body of Christ (1:22-23). It is also the new man (2:15) and the dwelling place, or habitation, of God (2:22). The church has at least these three functions: to be the Body of Christ, to be the new man, and to be the dwelling place of God.</P><P>The church is not merely a gathering of the called ones. It is not just a congregation. The church is something organic. It is the organic Body of Christ. Every person needs a body. Christ is a great person; thus, He needs a great Body. Christ is so great that He fills all in all. He fills the whole universe, including all the galaxies. He is great to such an extent that He becomes the dimensions of the universe. The breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe is just Christ (Eph. 3:18). Such an unlimited and immeasurable Christ needs a Body, and this Body is the church. Today, this Body is everywhere. There are parts of this Body in England, in Brazil, in Iceland, in China, in Mongolia, in India, in Tibet, and in all other parts of the earth. We all are the organic members of this vast Body of Christ.</P><P>On the one hand, the church is the Body. This is its function in relation to Christ. On the other hand, the church is also the new man. This is its function in relation to God. In this whole universe, God is moving. He is working for the accomplishing of His great economy. The word economy means a household administration or plan. God has a great household plan, and God's household, which is the Body of Christ, is unlimitedly great. In God's household plan, the entire universe is a large room in which God's household lives. In order to carry out His eternal plan, which is the economy of the ages, God needs a man. He does not need more than one man; He needs only one man. This one man is the new man.</P>
