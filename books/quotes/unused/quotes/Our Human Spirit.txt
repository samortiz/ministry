Having a soul man possesses selfconsciousness which gives him his personality his self and is able to reason choose and respond emotionally
Bios, the physical life, is in the body; psuche, the human life, is in the soul; and zoe, the divine life is in the spirit
We all must learn to walk, not according to the life which is in our soul, but according to the life which is in our spirit
Today there is a great need that all the Lord's children become those who walk and live according to their spirit
Two kinds of materials, the dust to form a body and the breath of life getting into this body, resulted in a living soul, a living man
The word for spirit here in Proverbs 20:27 is not the Hebrew word ruach, but neshamah-the same word used in Genesis 2:7 for 'breath'
In the Old Testament there is at least one verse proving that the breath of life mentioned in Genesis 2:7 is the very spirit of man
It says the conscience of man is the lamp of the Lord because the conscience is the main part of the human spirit
The King James Version says 'the breath of all mankind' because the word ruach can mean breath as well as spirit
The American Standard Version renders it as 'the breath of all mankind' in the text, but in the note it says our spirit, the spirit of man
In Luke 1:46-47 Mary said, 'My soul doth magnify the Lord' , and 'my spirit hath rejoiced' , 'in God my Saviour'
In 1 Thessalonians 5:23 they are not synonyms because there is the conjunction 'and'-'spirit and soul and body'
We are a living thing and we also have a soul, but besides the soul we have something super, something higher-the human spirit
To strive together for the preaching of the gospel, for the spreading of the kingdom of God, we need to be with one soul
To stand we need to be in one spirit, but to spread the gospel we need to be of one thought, of one mind, of one opinion, of one concept
It is rather hard to say whether this is the Holy Spirit or the human spirit because the two spirits are mingled as one
We should walk not only according to the Holy Spirit and not only according to the human spirit, but according to the mingled spirit
Our human spirit is the center of our being and the unique organ for us to contact the Lord; in our spirit we can be one with the Lord
The Scriptures clearly reveal that we have a human spirit and that God created our human spirit for us to contact Him
When a person is dead physically, that doesn't mean his human life in the soul is dead, but it means his physical life, the bios, is dead
Today this very God comes into us to be with us in our spirit with the incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ
God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit' , not in the Holy Spirit, but in our human spirit
The word commonly used in Hebrew for spirit is ruach, but here in Proverbs 20:27 the Hebrew word for spirit is neshamah not ruach
In Proverbs 20:27 the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord for searching our inward parts, for God's dealing with us
In Exodus 35:21, during the time when the tabernacle was going to be built up, the people's spirit prompted them
Not only did their heart move them, but also their spirit prompted them to go on in a fast way to fulfill God's purpose
They tell us that in the whole universe there are three main things created by God: the heavens, the earth, and the human spirit
In the heavens you have many items, and on the earth there are many items, but God didn't itemize those things
As human beings we also have many parts, but God didn't say anything about all the parts of our body or the parts of our soul
Ezra 1 tells us about the beginning of the recovery, but Haggai tells us about the continuation of the recovery
Jeremiah 51:11 says also that the Lord 'stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it'
Job 6:4 tells us that to Job's realization what he suffered was not just something outward, but something inward in his spirit
God's dealing with him was not just something outward in his surroundings, but something inward, deep in his spirit
All these verses show us that the relationship, the fellowship, between us and God, is absolutely a matter in our spirit
Again, all this portrays clearly that the fellowship and the relationship between us and God is absolutely in our spirit
Proverbs 16:32 says, 'He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city'
Proverbs 25:28 says, 'He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls'
If you cannot manage your spirit, that means you have been defeated like a city that has been broken down with all the walls torn down
If we are strong in spirit, regardless of how ill we are in the body, our spirit can sustain the physical illness
Ecclesiastes 789 says Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit
To generate means it doesn't exist, but to regenerate means it exists already and now another life is put into it
In Genesis 1 and 2, man was made in God's image, but by that time man didn't have God's eternal, uncreated life
God put man before the tree of life that man would take His life, but before man took the life of God, man fell
Even if you are redeemed, if you haven't received the life of God, God's purpose has not been fulfilled with you
We have to realize that redemption is just a recovery procedure for the final purpose, which is to have God's life
After being brought back, and after being purified and cleansed with detergent, you need a further step-to fill the bottles with Coca-Cola
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God, came into our spirit to quicken it and to make it alive again
In doctrine, they may know that there is something which is called the human spirit, but in practice they don't know how to use the spirit
The book of John reveals that the Holy Spirit begets the human spirit and the human spirit worships the divine Spirit
If you have only electrical waves in the air and you don't have a radio with a receiver, how could you receive the electrical waves?
We have to cooperate with God by preparing the proper organ to receive what He is, what He has done, and what He is going to do
Our coordination that we could render to God is to prepare our spirit, to regulate our spirit, and to tune our spirit
Romans 2:29 tells us that today in the spiritual realm, in the kingdom of God, everything must be in spirit, not in letter
Every time they have a wedding, the pastor just goes to that certain portion and practices everything according to that prayer book
One pastor, however, instead of going on according to the regulations in letters, wept with tears before the bride and the bridegroom
We have the same Bible every morning, the same manna, but every morning it should be fresh under the fresh dew
We have to walk according to our spirit because today the Holy Spirit is within our spirit and is even one with our spirit
When we walk according to our spirit, spontaneously we walk according to the Holy Spirit, because the two spirits are one
Most people walk and do things according to the mind, according to what they think, and according to what they like
It is easy to discern the spirit from the flesh, but sometimes it is not easy to discern the spirit from the mind
Perhaps, for example, you may be thinking about visiting a brother, but deep within something is bothering you
You should walk not according to your thinking or your likes and dislikes but just according to the inner red light or the inner green light
In Acts 19:21 he purposed in the spirit; he didn't make up his mind or make a decision in his will, but he purposed in his spirit
By these verses we can realize that Paul was a person living, walking, working, acting, and moving in his spirit
Many people who are highly educated don't know what they are, who they are, where they are, or where they are going
If you are not clear about what you have to do with your wife, your husband, your children, or your brothers, go to your spirit
Also, the Spirit of God reveals the things of God, and the situation, the condition of man, to man in his spirit
Now he is a spiritual man, so he has the spiritual discernment; he can know the spiritual things and he can even know all the things of man
In spirit we have the filling-not the outpouring, not the outward filling, but the inward filling of the Holy Spirit in your spirit
When our spirit is one with our mind, when our mind is subject to our spirit, our spirit becomes a renewing spirit
Colossians 1:9-10 reveals that when you have such a renewing spirit in your mind, you do have the spiritual understanding
Timothy 1:7 says, 'For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind'
Hebrews 4:12 reveals that the spirit and soul can be divided just like the marrow can be divided from the joints
Philippians 1:27 says to 'stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together in the faith of the gospel'
There's no possibility for the soulish man to know God, but in the following verse it says the spirit, the human spirit, knows
With the soulish man there is no possibility to know God, but with the spiritual man there is the full possibility
The difference between being soulish and being spiritual is the very difference between the soul and the spirit
Anyhow, he said that whatever 1 Thessalonians 5:23 said, he would not admit that the spirit and soul are two different parts of our being
The word divides the spirit from the soul just as the sword divides the marrow from the joints which are the bones
Luke 1:46-47 says, 'And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour'
In the Epistles, we are always told that we have to walk according to spirit, live in the spirit, and do things by the spirit
Mark 83536 says For whoever wants to save his soul will lose it but whoever will lose his soul for My sake and the gospels shall save it
Luke 9:24-25 says, 'For whosoever will save his soul shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his soul for my sake, the same shall save it
John 12:25 says, 'He who loves his soul loses it, and he who hates his soul in this world shall keep it unto eternal life'
Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me'
For whoever desires to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it
Leviticus 11:44b says, 'neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth'
The soulish man cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God, so we have to give up, reject, and deny the soul
To deny yourself is to deny your own thought your opinion your idea your concept your love your wish your will your decision and your choice
We have to admit that much of the time we are soulish people because we are so emotional, thoughtful, and willful
Because we are so much in the soul, in the mind, emotion, and will, our human spirit does not have the chance, the ground, to do anything
At other times, however, you love certain brothers so much, simply because you are in the emotion, in the soul
If you would deny your emotion, deny your self, your love toward that brother would be transformed from the soul into the spirit
The more you are one with the Lord in the spirit, the more you are spiritual, the more keen you will be in your mind
After two or three years they became very keen in their mind, in their understanding, especially in the things of the Lord
A spiritual person, on the one hand, is so keen in the mind and emotion, and on the other hand, so strong in the will
A spiritual person is one who is so keen in the understanding of the mind, so emotional in his love and affection, and so strong in his will
With one brother you dont sense anything of the Lord but the other brother is so rich in his thought yet so strong so fresh in his spirit
It could be with the flesh and become a mind of the flesh, or with the spirit and become the mind of the spirit
The mind is not the life of the soul, but one of the faculties of the soul to be used, controlled, and directed by the spirit
We must learn the lesson to deny the natural mind, emotion, and will, and to put them under the control of the spirit
2 Corinthians 7:13 says, 'we rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you'
The way for a normal Christian to act, though, is to always deny the natural mind, will, and emotion, and take the Lord Jesus as his life
Also, no one has ever seen the physical life of a person's being, but we can know the physical life by its expression and by certain senses
In nature, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is sin, because it is the tree not only of good but of evil
Within us there are three parties: Satan as sin is in our flesh , God is in our spirit, and the self is in our soul represented by our mind
To set the mind on the flesh means to take sides with the flesh, to cooperate with the flesh, to stand with the flesh
To set the mind on the spirit means to take sides with the spirit, to cooperate with the spirit, to stand with the spirit
When you take sides with the spirit, cooperate with the spirit, walk in the spirit, and do things by the spirit, you sense life and peace
The sense of life is the sense of satisfaction, strengthening, refreshing, watering, enlightenment, and anointing
When you sense all these items deep within, that is the sense of life, and this sense proves you are walking according to spirit
Strife, discord, discomfort, restlessness, pain, bondage, and grief are aspects of the sense of death versus the sense of peace
It is not according to any reasons, any teachings, or any standard of right or wrong, good or bad, worldly or holy
If we would know this one thing and be ruled and controlled by it, the Lord would transform our inward being and our daily life
Timothy 1:7 tells us, 'God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind'
When we put all these verses together, we can see that the exercise unto godliness depends on the exercise of the spirit, where the Lord is
If you are going to exercise yourself unto godliness, you have to know how to exercise your spirit because the very God is in your spirit
Maybe you made a decision to pray for the church, but when you go to the Lord and start the prayer, the sense within is something different
The inner sense may indicate that you have to say something like this: 'O Lord, even with the church, I'm too much in the flesh'
The more you confess that you are in the flesh, the more you sense the anointing, the peace, the harmony, and the refreshment
