A Pattern under God&#8217;s Dispensation</h2><p>In 1:13-17 we see a pattern under God&#8217;s dispensation.<h2 class=head4>a. The Foremost Sinner</h2><p>Paul says that he was a foremost sinner (vv. 15-16). He was a blasphemer of God, a persecutor of man, and an insulting, destructive person with respect to the church. In verse 13 he says of himself, &#8220;Who formerly was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insulting destructive person; but I obtained mercy because being ignorant I acted in unbelief.&#8221; A blasphemer is one who blasphemes God, and a persecutor is one who persecutes man. Saul of Tarsus, a strict Pharisee (Acts 22:3; Phil. 3:4-5), could never have blasphemed God. But he had spoken evil of the Lord Jesus. Now he confesses that this was blaspheming. This indicates that he believed in the deity of Christ.<p>Saul of Tarsus persecuted the church in an insulting, destructive way (Acts 22:4; Gal. 1:13, 23), just as the insulting Jews persecuted the Lord Jesus.<p>Paul also says that he was ignorant and acted in unbelief. To be ignorant means to be in darkness, and unbelief comes from blindness. Saul of Tarsus was in darkness and acted in blindness when he opposed God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h2 class=head4>b. Having Obtained Mercy</h2><p>In verse 13 Paul testifies that he obtained mercy. Saul, a blasphemer and persecutor, first obtained mercy and then received grace (v. 14). Mercy reaches farther to the unworthy one than grace. Because Paul was a blasphemer of God and a persecutor of man, God&#8217;s mercy reached him first rather than the Lord&#8217;s grace.<h2 class=head4>c. Favored with the Lord&#8217;s Grace</h2><p>Verse 14 continues, &#8220;And the grace of our Lord superabounded with faith and love in Christ Jesus.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s grace, following God&#8217;s mercy, visited Saul of Tarsus and not only abounded, but superabounded in him with faith and love in Christ. Faith and love are the product of the Lord&#8217;s grace. Mercy and grace come to us from the Lord; faith and love return to the Lord from us. This is a spiritual traffic between the Lord and us. Faith is for us to receive the Lord (John 1:12), and love is for us to enjoy the Lord whom we have received (John 14:21, 23; 21:15-17).<h2 class=head4>d. Saved by Christ Jesus</h2><p>In verse 15 Paul declares, &#8220;Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.&#8221; Christ came into the world to be our Savior by incarnation (John 1:14). He was God incarnated that He may save us through His death and resurrection in His human body. This should be constantly announced as the gospel, the glad tidings, in a local church.<h2 class=head4>e. Believing on Christ unto Eternal Life</h2><p>In verse 16 Paul speaks of believing on Christ unto eternal life. The uncreated life of God is the ultimate gift and topmost blessing given by God to those who believe on Christ.<h2 class=head4>f. To Display All the Longsuffering of Christ and to Be a Pattern to All the Believers</h2><p>In verse 16 Paul says, &#8220;But because of this I obtained mercy, that in me, the foremost, Jesus Christ might display all His longsuffering for a pattern to them who are about to believe on Him unto eternal life.&#8221; Saul of Tarsus as the foremost among sinners became a pattern to sinners, who can be visited by God&#8217;s mercy and saved by the Lord&#8217;s grace.<h2 class=head3>7. Honor and Glory to the King of the Ages</h2><p>In verse 17 Paul says, &#8220;Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages, Amen!&#8221; This word needs to be understood in relation to the decline of the church. When Paul was in prison, the churches began to decline, and the situation was very disappointing. Many were discouraged. Even some of Paul&#8217;s co-workers left him. But he had a strong faith with an absolute assurance that the very God in whom he believed, the One who had entrusted him with the gospel of glory, is the King of the ages. He never changes. No earthly king can be called the King of the ages. Caesar was a temporary ruler, but how different is our God! The God whom Paul served truly is the King of the ages. This means that He is King of eternity. He never changes; He always remains the same.<p>Everything except God is corruptible. The church may decline, deteriorate, and become degraded, but God is incorruptible. Paul also says that God is invisible. God is powerful, everlasting, incorruptible, and also invisible. We cannot see Him. Certain terms ascribed to God in this verse are used only in this book. With Paul, we need to use these words to praise God. I would encourage someone to write a suitable melody for the singing of this verse. In a living, released way, we need to declare, &#8220;Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages, Amen!&#8221;<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
