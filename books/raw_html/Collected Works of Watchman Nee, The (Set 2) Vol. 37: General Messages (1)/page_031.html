<h2 class="head1">THE RECEIVING OF THE LIGHT</h2><p>Second, we have God's speaking, His shining, or His revelation. God spoke to Moses from the midst of the two cherubim. In the matter of fellowship, God stressed the fact that fellowship and communion with Moses was based on the mercy seat. However, He has no intention that we forget the cherubim; He has no intention that we forget His glory. In His shining, God spoke with Moses from the midst of the two cherubim. His emphasis is on His glory. If man can fellowship with Him upon the mercy seat, he is able to hear God's word from the midst of the cherubim. Of course, God has no intention that we forget the mercy seat either.</p><p>God spoke to Moses from the midst of the two cherubim; He led His children according to His glory. Wherever God's glory resides, there is His leading also. God's leading came in the form of the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. Through the pillar of cloud, man sees God's glory, and through the pillar of fire, man also sees God's glory. The place of God's glory is the place of His leading.</p><p>God speaks and leads according to His glory. When God speaks to us personally concerning a certain matter, that is the time we know that we are glorifying Him. If we see God's glory in a certain matter, we know that we have His leading in that matter. With many of God's children, leading and glory are two different things. But before God, glorifying God and being led by God are not two things but one. Wherever we find God's glory, we find His leading concerning certain matters for us. As soon as we see God's glory, we know that we are in the right place.</p><p>God spoke from the midst of the two cherubim. All those who have seen God's glory have heard His speaking. We do not have to see His glory first and then wait for His speaking. Once we see God's glory in the way of life, this seeing will give us a more profound knowledge than we previously had. Whenever we see God's glory, we understand and know.</p><p>What is right? What is wrong? What is the right way? What is the wrong way? What has spiritual value, and what does not have spiritual value? It all depends on whether or not God's glory is there. Some matters may be small and may not be worth much in man's eyes, but the minute you touch it, you know that you have touched God's glory. Once you touch God's glory, you know that you have the leading, and there is no need to wait for more leading. With some work, the more you engage yourself in it, the more you feel that it is cheap and wrong. With some other work, the more you engage yourself in it, the more shining you become, and the more light there is. You feel that such work is worthwhile and right. It is not a question of a great or a small work but a question of whether or not God's glory is there. If God's glory is not there, it is worthless; if God's glory is there, it is worthwhile.</p><p>When Moses preached God's word, he became a minister of the word in the eyes of the Lord. He ministered to God's people with God's word. All the words which God spoke to Moses and which He commanded Moses to convey to the Israelites were given to him from the midst of the two cherubim. Hence, when Moses spoke for God, he touched the glory of God. In the same way, if we touch the glory of God and see His glory, we will have something to say. Sometimes we feel very good about what we have said, and the arguments seem sound. Yet we feel that it is very superficial and shallow. There is no testimony of the word in our speaking, and there is no ministry of the word. If a matter is of God, we will immediately sense that it comes from the midst of the two cherubim and will know that the glory of God is there. God's glory is not only something objective but something among us and something we can know.</p><p>Many times in our daily life, we touch the glory of God, and we find that there is something that glorifies God. Such a glory becomes our leading. In our work we often touch the glory of God; we find glory in our work. At these times we can say that the glory brings us the leading. If we touch the glory of God while we are ministering a word to the church, we know that we have ministered God's word. Every time we receive a revelation from God, we touch the glory of God. When God speaks from the midst of the two cherubim, we do not merely have words, but we have glory as well. Whenever we have only words without glory, we know that we only have doctrine. Whenever there are words as well as glory, we know that we have revelation. It is strange that every time we see God's glory, our mouth may not be able to articulate it, but we know it deep within us. If anyone asks us how we see, we may not be able to tell him, but the result of the seeing is there. The greatest manifestation of glory is for us to prostrate ourselves on the ground. When we prostrate ourselves on the ground, we do not know what has happened, yet we know that we have touched God.</p><p>The basis of our fellowship with God and of receiving light from Him is this touch of God's glory. If we do not have this basis, everything we have is just doctrine and theory. May the Lord be gracious to us, so that day by day as we live on earth, we may touch God's glory.</p>
