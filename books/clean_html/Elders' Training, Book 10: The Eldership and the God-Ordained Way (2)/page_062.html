<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;the Emphasizing<br>of the Building Up of the Ministry<br>More Than the Local Churches</H2><P>"There has been a change of emphasis to the building up of the work or the ministry more than the local churches...it seems that in the past years...there has been more emphasis on the churches being for the ministry. The ministry has been promoted, exalted, and built up, and the churches have suffered greatly in the process."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>The basic problem in the matter that John covers in this accusation concerns the understanding of the relationship between the ministry and the churches. Concerning the relationship between the ministry or the work and the churches, it has been our practice, from Brother Nee's time up to the present time, that whatever the ministry or the work does is absolutely for the churches. Even in the building up of the work or the ministry, the purpose and goal are for the churches. The initial purpose and final goal of our ministry or work are absolutely and utterly for the churches. We have received our ministry from the Lord with a definite commission, that is, to build up the churches as the organic Body of Christ. Whatever we do&#151;preaching the gospel to save the sinners, feeding the new believers that they may grow, perfecting the saints that they may do the work that the gifted persons can do to build up the Body of Christ, teaching the word and expounding the Bible that the saints may be edified both in the truth and life, training the saints that they may be built up in the Lord's service and work, and even establishing the ministry or the work itself&#151;is for the building up of the churches. Our history has fully proven this.</P><P>In such a practice as ours, we also stress that all the churches with all the saints should cooperate and be one with the ministry, so that the ministry will be strengthened and be more effective, that the churches with all the saints may benefit more in the ultimate goal for the Lord's interest, that is, to have His organic Body fully built up. In the Apostle Paul's ministry, such a coordination (fellowship) and oneness were rendered to him by the churches and the saints. The church in Philippi with all the saints there, and the church in Corinth and the churches in Galatia with the saints, all did this (Phil. 1:5; 4:16, 18; 1 Cor. 16:1-3). The apostle even praised this kind of fellowship as a "good work" begun by the Lord, and believed that the Lord would complete such a good work until the day of His appearing (Phil. 1:6). The thought in John's accusation concerning the relationship between the ministry and the churches with all the saints can only weaken the ministry in its work for the church and deprive the churches and the saints of their enjoyment of the benefit of the ministry's work. Without the cooperation of the churches and the saints, it would be difficult for the ministry to be strong and effective in its work, and without the churches with the saints being one with the ministry, it would be difficult for the Lord's recovery to be prevailing in its spreading. To carry out the New Testament economy of God, the ministry, the churches, and the saints all must be one with one another.</P>
