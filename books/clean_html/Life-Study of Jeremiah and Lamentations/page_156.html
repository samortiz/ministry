The nations cannot avoid involvement with Israel, and Israel cannot avoid contact with the nations. In this message we will consider chapters forty-six and forty-seven.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT<br>AND JUDGMENT UPON EGYPT</H2><P>In chapter forty-six we see Jehovah's punishment and judgment upon Egypt.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Egypt Symbolically or Poetically Called Rahab<br>and Typifying the World<br>of Making a Living and of Enjoyment</H2><P>In the Old Testament Egypt, which is symbolically or poetically called Rahab (Isa. 51:9-10; Psa. 87:4), typifies the world of making a living and of enjoyment, with which Satan occupies and usurps the people chosen by God for His economy (Gen. 12:10; 41:57&#151;42:3; Num. 11:4-6). The name Rahab refers to a monster, to a large sea animal. This indicates that God regards Egypt as a monster, as an ugly, terrifying sea animal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The People of Israel Going Down to Egypt</H2><P>The people of Israel, as the elect of God, went down to Egypt and were usurped and enslaved by Pharaoh the king of Egypt (Exo. 1:1, 11-14), a type of Satan as the ruler of the world (John 12:31).</P><P>Because the world has many aspects, the Old Testament uses the nations to typify the world in its various aspects. The first of these types is Egypt. Egypt typifies the world in the aspect of making a living and of enjoyment, and Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, typifies Satan, the ruler of the world.</P>
