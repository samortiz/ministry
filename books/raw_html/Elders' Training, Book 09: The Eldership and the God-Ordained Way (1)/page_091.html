<P>If a certain brother were charged to take care of a group meeting, probably very few of the saints in the group would pray for that meeting. They would not bear the burden for the meeting because they know that a brother has been assigned to care for it. If this brother has some helpers assigned to him, they may not even help to bear the burden because they know that this brother is bearing the main responsibility. This brother has to consider what kind of lesson he should give. He has to pray to get a subject from the Bible with the help of books like Truth Lessons or Life Lessons. Sometimes such a teacher would be exhausted. He may not know what lesson to choose, what lesson is applicable at that time. When we take the God-ordained way of meeting, however, we leave this matter to the Holy Spirit. The Spirit knows what to cover, and He can be one with the attendants in the meeting to raise the appropriate questions. In one meeting many questions can be asked and properly answered. In the old way, the riches within only one brother are dug out, but in the God-ordained way, everyone has an opportunity to pour out his riches. These are the riches of the Body of Christ. This kind of mutual teaching incites us to love and good works. This is the ecstatic, joyful way to have a group meeting. No one is overburdened because we all bear the burden.</P><P>The group meeting gives everyone the chance to speak. Spontaneously, everyone will participate in the speaking. Humanly speaking, no one can learn a language unless they practice speaking it. By the saints practicing to speak in the group meetings, everyone will learn how to prophesy. It is also profitable for some brothers to act as tutors in helping the saints to prophesy. Perhaps there is a new one among us who has been saved for only six months. A brother who is functioning as a tutor can encourage this new one by telling him not only to speak by answering questions in the group meeting but also to go to the Lord's Day meeting of the church to speak, to prophesy. He can tell this new brother to enlarge and uplift what he has been speaking in the group meeting for a prophecy in the Lord's Day meeting. His speaking will be prophesying with the riches of his experience of Christ or with the riches of his knowledge concerning Christ.</P><P>When we prophesy in the larger meetings of the church, we should not speak too long. Each one should prophesy for no longer than three minutes. The brothers who are tutors can observe the saints who prophesy and help them by coaching them. They can take some time with the saints after the meeting on the Lord's Day to give them some helpful adjustments. This is like a coach teaching the players. One thing we need to remember for all of our meetings is that we need to be "crazy" with and in the Spirit and the word.</P>
