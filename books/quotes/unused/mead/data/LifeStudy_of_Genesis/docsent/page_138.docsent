   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e. The Anticipated Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Along with the sufferings ordained by God Adam experienced the anticipated redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why do we say that it was an anticipated redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because at the time of Genesis 3 the actual redemption had not been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Genesis 3:21 we see an anticipation of the redemption that was to be accomplished four thousand years later.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both the man and the woman were in a situation that needed redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although God had not condemned them, although God had sought them out and had ordained suffering as a restriction and protection for them, and although God had proclaimed to them the promise of the coming seed, when Adam and Eve looked at themselves they were still mostly naked.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I say that they were mostly naked because they were poorly covered by the aprons skirts which they had made for themselves out of fig leaves Gen 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fig-leaf skirts represented man's own work in covering his sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Adam and Eve were sinful, and their eyes were opened to know good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One servant of the Lord has said that there is no need to do evil, for simply knowing evil is itself evil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once Adam and Eve were innocent, not evil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, when they realized that they were naked, they became evil because knowing evil is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No one can avoid evil if he knows evil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as you know evil you will become involved with evil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The best way to stay away from evil is not to know it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Adam and Eve were sinful and knew that they were sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus they tried to help themselves by making skirts of fig leaves to cover their nakedness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That was the work of their own hands with the leaves of a fig tree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the fall, any use that man makes of the vegetable life signifies his doing without blood for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before the fall man did not need blood to redeem him, but after the fall he did.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, the attempt to cover his nakedness with the vegetable life can never work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sinful man needs the blood of an animal; he needs the bleeding sacrifice for redemption Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the skirts that Adam and Eve made from fig leaves did not cover their nakedness in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we should not forget Genesis 3:20.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After Adam heard the glad tidings, he immediately called his wife's name, "Eve," which means "Living."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Adam and Eve were trembling in fear of the condemnation of death, but suddenly Adam heard the glad tidings, responded in a believing way, and said to Eve, "Eve, you are living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are not going to die; you are going to be living."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 20 means that Adam believed in the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first time that the Bible indicates the matter of believing is in Genesis 3:20, and the first believer in the good news was Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Adam heard the glad tidings, he believed that he and Eve were going to live and not die.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Following verse 20 in which we see Adam's believing, we come to verse 21 where we see God's justification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After Adam believed in God's glad tidings, God made coats of skins for him and his wife and clothed them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The coats fully covered them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Think a little about the skirts made of fig leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After a few days the leaves would have been dried and broken.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, they would have dropped away, and the man and the woman would have been completely naked.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, you should never try to cover yourself by your own work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You are sinful in the eyes of God and naked in His sight.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Anything that you do to cover yourself is just a skirt made from the withered fig leaves of the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You need the skins from the animal life to cover you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The coats of skins which God made for Adam and Eve covered them day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please remember that nearly every item mentioned in the first three chapters of Genesis is a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here in Genesis 3:20-21 we have the seed of believing in the gospel and the seed of justification by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The seed of believing in God's gospel is found in Genesis 3:20 where Adam declared that Eve's name was "Living."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God proclaimed the gospel and Adam responded by saying, "Living," that was the seed of believing in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Following this, God came to justify.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Adam and Eve were naked and they made themselves skirts as a covering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These skirts did not cover their bodies adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After God had come in to preach the gospel and Adam had responded by believing, God placed coats over the man and the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that God justified them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be justified means to be covered with the righteousness of God, which is Christ Himself, not with anything man-made.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Adam and Eve's being under the coats signified that they were in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Galatians 3:27 says, "As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The coat is the clearest type of Christ as God's righteousness, the righteousness that covers us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, figuratively speaking, Adam and Eve were in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, both man's believing and God's justifying the believers were sown as seeds in Genesis 3:20-21.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These seeds are developed in the Epistles of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although the Bible does not say explicitly that the skins were taken from a lamb, I, along with others, believe that they were lamb skins, because the skins were made into coats.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some versions say "robes" and others "garments."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At any rate, the skins were made into clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To be sure, the skins did not come from cows; they must have been the skins of tender lambs, skins so suitable for clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After the coats of skins had been placed on them, Adam and Eve had the appearance of a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Was Adam a man or a lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All that was visible was the wool, for Adam was completely covered by the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although he was a man, he had become a lamb in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>People always become the very thing which covers them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Since we all are covered by Christ, we will express Christ and resemble Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When Adam and Eve were covered by their self-made skirts of fig leaves, they must have looked like ugly, naked, sinful persons.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, after putting on the coats made with the lamb skins, they must have looked like lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God has put us in Christ 1 Cor 1:30 , and we have put on Christ Gal 3:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thus, we can express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Paul could even say, "For to me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Paul became the expression of Christ through being one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This thought of expressing Christ was sown in the type of the coats of skins which covered Adam and Eve and which became their expression.</S>
