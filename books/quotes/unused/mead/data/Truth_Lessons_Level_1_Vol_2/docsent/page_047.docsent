   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TEXT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The gospel of Jesus Christ is simply Jesus Christ Himself Acts 5:42b; Rom 1:1-3 , with His person, His accomplishments, His attainments, His obtainments, and His work in this age, in the coming age, and in eternity as the content.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. HIS PERSON</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 1:1 and 14 also say, In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God....And the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus is the complete God who became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the Son of God John 20:31; Rom 1:4a ; He is the embodiment of God, the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily Col 2:9 ; and He is the effulgence of God s glory, the express image of God s substance Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Lord Jesus came to the earth, outwardly He appeared very lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because He used the flesh as a veil to conceal God s glory, men could not see that He was God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet He was the very embodiment of the most high God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. Man the Son of Man</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the perfect man, the Son of Man who was born of the virgin Mary Matt 1:23; Luke 19:10 , and who, becoming in the likeness of men Phil 2:7 , lived as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Men saw Him as a carpenter Mark 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He hungered, thirsted, rejoiced, became angry, and also wept.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was loving, compassionate, sympathetic, condescending, patient, and forgiving toward people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was without sin; even He knew no sin 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was a genuine man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After His resurrection, He was still a man Luke 24:39-43 ; in His ascension He is still a man Acts 7:56 ; at His coming back He will still be a man Matt 26:64 ; and even in eternity He will still be a man John 1:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. The Redeemer</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus is the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Matthew 20:28 says, The Son of Man came...to give His life a ransom for many.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All have sinned and come short of the glory of God Rom 3:23 and are under God s condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the requirement of God s righteousness, without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus took on a body of blood and flesh, and He gave His life and shed His blood on the cross to be the ransom for many.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus He satisfied God s righteous requirement and redeemed us from under the curse of the law Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With His precious blood He redeemed us 1 Pet 1:18-19; Rev 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore He is our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>E. The Savior</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus is not only the Redeemer but also the Savior Luke 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man has a twofold problem: on the one hand, man has the problem of the charges of sin against him before God; on the other hand, he has the problem of the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, man has this twofold need: first, concerning the problem of outward position, law, and the charges of sin, there is the need for the redemption of the blood of Christ; second, concerning the problem of the old life and sinful nature within man, there is the need for another life, a transcendent life, to enter into man to save him from his fallen life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, the Lord Jesus as the Redeemer accomplished redemption for us by His death; on the other hand, He rose from the dead to enter into us to be our Savior of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Romans 5:10 tells us that while we were enemies of God, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, that is, through His redeeming death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that the charges of sin against us before God were removed, and we were redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the redeeming aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans 5:10 also indicates that, since we were reconciled to God, we need to be saved much more in the life of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the saving aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be redeemed is outward, objective, and once for all; to be saved is inward, subjective, and daily for our whole life long.</S>
