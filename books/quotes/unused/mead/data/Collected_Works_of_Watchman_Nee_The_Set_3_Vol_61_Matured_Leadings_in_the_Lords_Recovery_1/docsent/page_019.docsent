   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Synthesis</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third way to study the Bible is by the way of synthesis.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through synthesis we can trace a line through the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is a central line in the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's revelation to man comes in many portions and in many ways Heb 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It comes a little here and a little there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every time God's revelation comes to us, it is more advanced than the previous times.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we have to study in the way of synthesis.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to find the complete revelation of the entire Bible through synthesis.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the end of the Bible, God's revelation is fully completed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to study this way, we have to acquaint ourselves with the divine arguments presented in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit has His own line of argument.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul said that one has to exercise his spirit as well as his understanding in discerning spiritual things 1 Cor 14:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hebrews 5:14 says, "But solid food is for the full-grown, who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to study the Bible, our faculties must be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only then will we be able to discriminate between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Philippians Paul told us that he not only preached the gospel, but he was also given to the defense of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man is not properly trained in his understanding, he will be short of arguments and words as soon as he is challenged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The gospel was powerful in Paul, but in us it is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is because our understanding is not fully exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can only synthesize topics that are similar in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those that do not belong to the same group cannot be synthesized together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we try to synthesize unrelated topics, we will confuse the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, the four Gospels record the earthly life, ministry, and words of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In reading His words, we have to differentiate between commandments and exhortations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to differentiate words of righteousness from words of grace cf.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Heb 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Epistles were all written by the apostles under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, yet they are not all God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With God's Word, it is not simply a matter of taking it or leaving it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul did not have God's commandment, yet he still spoke God's word 1 Cor 7:25, 40 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul could do this because he had been constituted by God through many years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although he argued and reasoned with the church in Corinth, his word still became a revelation to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot wander through the Word mindlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to follow a definite line.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In reading Paul's Epistles, it is very important that we follow his divine arguments and capture his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The thoughts governing Paul at the time he wrote his Epistles are the thoughts of the Holy Spirit 1 Cor 7:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we gloss over everything indiscriminately, we will not understand what we have read even after studying it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The problem with us today is that we are too poor in utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There should be an abundance of utterance in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to be rich in utterance, we have to spend time to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Bible Versions and Reference Books</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To study the Bible, one needs good translated versions and reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Chinese Union Version is one of the seven best versions in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is based on the best version of the Greek text.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are several versions that are good for comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Of the Chinese translations for reference, the best version is the Wen-Li Union Translation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In many cases, its translation of single-syllable expressions is better than that of the Chinese Union Version.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Concerning the Lord's resurrection, it makes a distinction between resurrection, fu-hwo, and raising up, fu-chi.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Another version which is also acceptable is the Joseph Shi translation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The translator was a converted Jew who aimed at providing a good translation for the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He studied Chinese and finished this version all by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was published over twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The expressions he used are not the best; they are somewhat awkward.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the translation is very accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Reference books can be read as one has the time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we must exercise discretion in choosing which ones to read.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some expositional reference books are not that common, and they can be quite deep.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For example, Darby's Synopsis of the Books of the Bible renders help to some but is a damage to others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The flow of the Holy Spirit is always advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Such reference books should be studied only with proper fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This fellowship will provide the proper protection and safeguard.</S>
