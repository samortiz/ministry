        <h2 class="head2">The Line of the Tree and the River in the Bible</h2>
<p>There are at least two verses in the Bible that speak of how man receives God as his enjoyment. Song of Songs 2:3 speaks of a person who knows and enjoys God as her Beloved, Husband, and Supplier. The believer in this verse compares her Beloved to an apple tree. She finds delight in His shade and sits down, and His fruit is sweet to her taste. Psalm 36:8 speaks of a person being saturated with the fatness of God&rsquo;s house and drinking of the river of God&rsquo;s pleasures. One verse speaks of God as a tree supplying fruit, and the other speaks of God as a river for man to drink.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John also speaks of man receiving God as his life and enjoyment. Hence, it says that the eternal God was incarnated so that He could become man&rsquo;s life and enjoyment (1:1, 14; 6:35; 4:14). On the one hand, John says that God is like a vine (15:1), and on the other hand, John says that God is like rivers of living water (7:38).</p>
<p>At the end of the Bible, the tree is with the river. Revelation 22:1-2 says, &ldquo;A river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life.&rdquo; The tree of life will be enjoyed in eternity by all those who have been saved by the grace of God. The tree of life grows on both sides of the river of life as an eternal blessing to those who have been saved by grace. The central thought of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, is the tree of life and the river of water of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Tree Signifying Christ<br />
and the River Signifying the Spirit</h2>
<p>The tree signifies Christ, the embodiment of God, coming to be man&rsquo;s life. The river signifies the Spirit, the transfiguration of Christ, flowing into man as the water of life. God is embodied in Christ, and Christ has been transfigured into the Spirit (Col. 2:9; 1 Cor. 15:45). Now God is the tree of life to be man&rsquo;s food, and He is the river of water of life for man to drink. The tree and the river are God in Christ as the Spirit to be our life supply.</p>
<p>The Christian life is not a matter of worshipping or serving God, or of doing good, but of eating Christ and drinking the Spirit in order to enjoy God. If we eat Christ, we will spontaneously live out Christ, and if we drink the Spirit, He will flow out of us. God is not focused on our worshipping or serving Him or on our doing good. His intention is for us to eat and drink Him. God is embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit for man to eat and drink. Therefore, the Lord said to the hungry and thirsty people, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst&rdquo; (John 6:35). He is the tree of life and the bread of life, and the Spirit is the river of water of life. God wants us to eat and drink Him so that He may become our life, our nourishment, and our supply. He is our completion; without Him we cannot be complete in this life or in eternity. Only by eating, drinking, and gaining the Lord can we be blessed and made complete.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S EXPERIENCE OF<br />
EATING, DRINKING, AND ENJOYING GOD</h2>
<p>Now we come to the experiential aspect of eating Christ as the tree of life and drinking the Spirit as the water of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Experience of the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s introduction to the tree of life began in Genesis 2. After God created Adam, He put him in the garden of Eden. There were many trees in the garden, but in the middle of the garden there was the tree of life. God wanted Adam to eat of the tree of life.</p>
<p>Even though Adam had the highest created life, it was still only a created life; he did not have the uncreated, eternal life of God. Therefore, God put him in front of the tree of life so that he would contact and receive God&rsquo;s eternal life. The focus of the tree of life in Genesis 2 corresponds to the thought in the Gospel of John, which is that man would gain the life of God (1:4). Our first experience of the tree of life is regeneration, whereby we receive the life of God.</p>
<p>In Exodus 15 the children of Israel came to Marah, but they could not drink the water, because it was bitter. God showed Moses a tree to cast into the waters. Then the waters became sweet (vv. 22-25). This incident shows that in our journey through life the only way to be saved from bitterness, suffering, anguish, and misery is to cast the tree into the bitter waters, that is, to receive Christ into our bitter situations. Then we are healed from being bitter, and we become sweet and are able to rejoice and praise in our suffering.</p>
<p>Song of Songs 2:3 says that the Lord whom we pursue is as an apple tree. We can sit down in His shade to enjoy His covering, and we can taste of His fruit. This experience follows the experience at Marah. After we take the Lord into our sufferings, the Lord will change our bitterness into sweetness. The Lord will also become our enjoyment&mdash;He will cover us with His shade and supply us with His fruit so that we may have delight in His shade and sit down to enjoy the sweetness of His fruit.</p>
<p>John 15:1 says that the Lord is the vine. The emphasis of the vine is not our enjoyment of the Lord but our union with Him. We have become the branches of the vine; that is, we can experience an intimate union with the Lord. We were once without Christ, we were without hope in the world (Eph. 2:12), and our life was filled with pain. Then one day we received Christ, and our life became sweet. Now, when we seek Him, we can enjoy Him by sitting under His shade and tasting the sweetness of His fruit. Then we will enter into a life union with Him. He is the vine, and we are the branches. We have a life relationship with the Lord.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:2-19 reveals what the enjoyment of those who are saved by grace will be in eternity. In eternity the Lord will still be the tree of life for us to enjoy. We will enjoy this blessing for eternity. A person who does not enter into this blessing in this age will suffer eternal perdition. This blessing is the enjoyment of Christ as our food and supply for eternity.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
