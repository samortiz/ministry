   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY THE OUTPOURING OF THE SEVEN BOWLS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND BABYLON THE GREAT Scripture Reading: Rev 15 17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The treading of the winepress of the fury of God will occur at the very end of this age Rev 14:17-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Following this, Satan will be thrown into the abyss, and the thousand-year kingdom will begin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the things mentioned in Revelation 15, 16, and 17 do not follow the treading of the winepress in time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After chapter fourteen, the record of the Scriptures comes back to give further details of other important things and crucial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE OUTPOURING OF THE SEVEN BOWLS The Praise of the Late Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 15:1-2a says, And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having seven plagues, the last plagues; for in them the fury of God was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And I saw as it were a glassy sea mingled with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 4:6 the glassy sea is like crystal, but in chapter fifteen the glassy sea is mingled with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This glassy sea eventually becomes the lake of fire 20:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The glassy sea is only mingled with fire, but when it becomes the lake of fire, its contents are intensified; it is all fire and no glass.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter four when the glassy sea is first mentioned, God had not yet judged all negative things with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By chapter fifteen, however, many items have begun to be judged with fire through the first six trumpets 8:7, 8, 10; 9:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore the sea of glass is now mingled with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The sea of glass is the trash can of the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever God does not want, He throws it into this sea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is also foreshadowed by the laver in front of the tabernacle and temple of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The laver collected all the dirt that was washed away by the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 15:2b speaks of those who come away victorious from the beast and from his image and from the number of his name standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are the late overcomers who pass through the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To stand means not only to live but to be raised up to live.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That these overcomers are standing indicates that they were martyred and then resurrected and raptured to stand above the glassy sea.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to verse 3, They sing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are Your works, Lord God the Almighty!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Righteous and true are Your ways, O King of the nations!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This refers to the song of Moses sung by the Israelites who passed triumphantly through the Red Sea Exo 15:1-19 ; the Red Sea in Exodus 14 and 15 corresponds to the sea of glass in Revelation 15.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 4 continues, Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For You alone are holy; for all the nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous judgments have been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Scene in Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>before the Outpouring of the Seven Bowls</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verses 5 to 8 say, And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened, and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in clean bright linen and girded around the breasts with golden girdles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the fury of God, who lives forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one could enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we have seen, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven is the central thought of the second portion of the prophecy in this book 11:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That no one could enter into the temple means that no one was able to pray to stop the wrath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God will give no ground for anyone to stop Him until His wrath is fully poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The First Six Bowls</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Chapter sixteen continues, And I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the fury of God into the earth v. 1 . Again, the temple is the center of the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 2 is the first bowl: And the first went and poured out his bowl into the earth; and there came to be an evil and malignant sore upon the men who have the mark of the beast and worship his image.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is God s dealing with the worshippers, the followers, of the beast.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 3 is the second bowl: And the second poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living soul that was in the sea died.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the second trumpet, one third of the creatures in the sea died, but at this time everything in the sea dies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How awful that will be!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verses 4 to 7 speak of the third bowl, saying, And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And I heard the angel who had power over the waters saying, You are righteous, who is and who was, the Holy One, because You have judged these things; for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink; they are worthy of it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And I heard the altar saying, Yes, Lord God the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verses 8 and 9 are the fourth bowl: And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given to it to burn men with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And men were burned with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In principle these four bowls are like the four trumpets in 8:7-12.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The four trumpets damage the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first four bowls also deal with the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The bowls are the same in principle, but in degree they are more intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All these plagues deal with the kingdom, the followers, and the worshippers of the beast.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fifth bowl is in 16:10-11, which says, And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain and blasphemed the God of heaven for their pains and for their sores; and they did not repent of their works.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot image what kind of darkness and pain this will be, for we have never experienced it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 12 continues, And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This indicates that the trouble which will follow later comes from the east, the direction of the Euphrates.</S>
