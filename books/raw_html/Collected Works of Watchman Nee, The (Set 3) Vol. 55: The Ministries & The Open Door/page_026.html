<h2 class="head1">ONLY WORKING, NOT RETROSPECTING</h2><p>All things work together for good. The orphanage has been back in Hankow for seventeen months now. In these seventeen months, I have learned many things. When my will was shaken to the point of falling and I was almost disappointed, the Lord said to me, "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by Him." From that time on, I dared not give up on myself or consider myself too poor to be useful. I went on, one step at a time, according to the light I had received. I did not look back on the past. I am learning to have Brother Lawrence's attitude: "Only working, not retrospecting." I do not care if things are bad or good.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi<br />August 10, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: P. O. Box 99, Hankow</p><h2 class="head1">LESSONS IN THE VALLEY OF SHADOW</h2><p>My heart is completely filled with happiness and rest because God is stirring within His children in His church in these days. Oh! I give worship, blessing, and thanks to our heavenly Father, the everlasting God. He always hears man's prayers and accepts man's cries. He forever supports those in weakness and comforts those in afflictions. A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoking flax He will not quench. I will now tell you a little of God's work, grace, and mercy on me in recent months. I hope you will be able to teach and correct me in many areas so that I will not become proud or dejected.</p><p>In September of last year, God brought me into the valley of shadow. In the beginning of October, I fell into trials. I felt exceedingly heavy and depressed both inwardly and outwardly. However, in the deepest part of my heart, I still believed that time would bring me through. Though I walked through the valley of the shadow of death, I feared not, because the Lord was with me. (Of course, at that time I did not feel this way.)</p><p>While I remained in the valley of shadow, I was drawn to read the books of poetry, especially the book of Job. In reading it, however, I discovered that I was short and had sinned. Job, who had fallen into such a serious trial, never sinned with his mouth or offended God. What about me? I often blamed God and murmured against Him. Sometimes I judged myself. If I had continued like that for a long time, I would have been like the Israelites who died in the wilderness; they could not enter Canaan because of their murmuring. Later, God gradually led the brothers to pray that I would come out of the valley of shadow. O dear brother, "Weeping may linger in the evening,/But a ringing shout goes up in the morning." Hallelujah! In May of this year, I finally came out of the valley of shadow. Oh! It was like the bamboo shoots in spring that come out after the rain, and the honey that drips from the bees' nest. How fresh it was! How joyful! How sweet!</p><p>I felt that "I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine." At the same time, I had a great inward thirst. So I began to pursue. I felt that I could not be a Christian in the way that I had been before. I felt that being a Christian is not a matter of degree; it is a matter of the whole being becoming involved. It was not a matter of being good or bad but a matter of being a model or living up to standard. It is not a matter of curing a headache or a sore foot but of having a thorough examination and rooting out the source of the illness. I felt that a Christian cannot be loose in following the Lord; he must first sit down and consider the cost. I finally felt that the first basic thing a Christian must do is consecrate his life and not be ashamed of the gospel, just as Paul did not hold on to his own life in proving the gospel. The second matter was to stand absolutely on God's side and not to discount any of God's word at all. Was not the first sin in the universe a twisting and discrediting of God's word? We should not just submit to God's word in principle; we should obey the clear writings too. What do you think?</p><p>After this, I had a time like I never have had before of reading the Bible, praying, fasting, and dealing with the Lord. I thought of how desolate my many years as a Christian had been! How poor! I have really been uselessly taking up space! I also discovered that I had not learned any lesson during this time. I did not have a good attitude toward the gospel. I had to ask God's forgiveness for this.</p><p>When I read the first chapter of Matthew on May 26, it dawned on me that the first person mentioned was Abraham. I felt that I should learn to give up things and be willing to consecrate myself like Abraham. When I came to chapter two about Jesus' birth, I found how Herod's heart and even the hearts of everyone in Jerusalem were unsettled. I said to myself, "Now I realize that wherever the gospel goes, it should unsettle men!" May God give me a way to unsettle people when the gospel goes out from me. I set my mind to make a gospel signboard to carry on my back. After talking to some brothers in the university, we proceeded with it. We made vests of white cloth, with many kinds of gospel slogans written on the front and back; we wore them in class, near the school, on the bus, and on the road back and forth between the meeting hall and the school. When we first began to wear them, we felt very embarrassed, but by the Lord's grace we told ourselves that we should not be ashamed of the gospel. This was the motivation and the beginning of our wearing the gospel vests. Later, we marched on all the streets once or twice a week, wearing the vests and preaching the gospel. We did not just let the world hear it; we also let them see it.</p><p>I believe if we have three hundred people who are absolute for God and who do not care for their own lives, they will shake Shanghai. If there are three thousand people, they will shake the entire country. If there are thirty thousand people, they will shake the whole earth. In this way the gospel will be quickly preached to the ends of the earth; it will hasten the coming of the kingdom of God. May God give us more people! Have not the leading brothers said that the outward appearance of the church has been in desolation for two thousand years? May God give us mercy, that we would stop the desolation in this generation. May God quickly recover us to the original condition of the church.</p><p>My hand is sore from writing this much, but my heart is burning and excited. The preceding account is my small experience. I do not hope to do anything great. I just want to take my stand and advance the gospel "in one accord" with all the saints.</p><p>If there are any errors in my letter, I hope you will feel free to correct and teach me. Amen.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Hsu Er-jian<br />August 11, 1948<br />Jiao-Tong University</p>
