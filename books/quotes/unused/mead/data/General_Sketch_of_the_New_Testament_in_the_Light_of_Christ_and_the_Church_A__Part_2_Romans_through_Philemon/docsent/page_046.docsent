   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The New Man with Christ as Life and the Body as His Fullness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we may see some of the details of the different aspects of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When a man is born, he has a human life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we did not have the human life, we could not be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That the church is the new man means that the church has a new life, and this new life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is life to us because He is the very embodiment of the Father and is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This life, therefore, is the Triune God, who is typified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Originally, we were the old man because we had only the old life, the created life of man, but through Christ's crucifixion and resurrection He has regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Regeneration is simply the imparting of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through the processes of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection the Triune God has imparted Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we have a new life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This life is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way we become the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, this new man is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The new man is a matter of life, while the Body is a matter of expression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without a body a person can have no expression; no one could know him or recognize him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are known and recognized by our body as our expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That the church is the Body of Christ means that it is the very expression of Christ, and Christ is the life within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Body is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A head without a body is poor; it is without a fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Similarly, a disjointed body is not the fullness of the head.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only a proper body is the complete fullness of the head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus is the Head without the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, in the Gospels there is no fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the book of Acts, however, Jesus is duplicated thousands of times.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, in Acts we can see the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is composed of many members, and every member is a duplication, a living copy, of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These living members composed together form the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Body is the very expression of Christ, just as a person's physical body is his expression.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This Body is also the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 1:23 does not speak of the fullness of Christ, the fullness of the Son of God, or the fullness of the Lord Jesus; it speaks of the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is difficult to understand what the fullness is; this is too profound and our understanding is too limited.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We also cannot explain how Christ fills all things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can only say that this term shows how great Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today His fullness is a universal fullness because as the One who fills all in all He is unlimitedly great.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He fills not only all but all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is unlimited, and such an unlimited Christ needs a universal Body to be His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although the church on the earth may sometimes appear to be a mess, it is still in the principle of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is in the United States, Europe, Africa, Asia, and in every place on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church as the Body is the universal fullness of Christ in both space and time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Counterpart of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This fullness is also the counterpart of Christ, just as Eve was a counterpart to Adam to match Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That a wife is one with her husband typifies that the church is one with Christ; this is the great mystery in Ephesians 5:32.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A husband and wife are like two halves of a watermelon.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the two halves are put together, they become a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One half needs the other half to match it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same way, the church is a part of Christ, the counterpart of Christ, to match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A wife is the fullness of the husband; in Genesis 2 Eve is both the counterpart and fullness of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Adam was a bachelor, he had no fullness, but when he was given a wife to match him as his counterpart, she became his fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, the church in life and nature is one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The two have one life and one nature, so the church becomes a part of Christ to match Christ.</S>
