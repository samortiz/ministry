   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TYPES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to study the types in the Old Testament, we must first have a foundation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Testament speaks of Christ, His redemption, the church, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These are four great spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The chief types in the Old Testament are types of these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They either typify Christ, redemption, the church, or the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament we see the photograph before we see the person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the New Testament we first see the person, and then we go back to the Old Testament to see the photograph.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we have seen the reality of Christ, redemption, the church, and the Holy Spirit, it is much easier for us to see the Old Testament types.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The re-creation in Genesis 1 is a type of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter two Eve is a type of the church in its sinless state.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we think of ourselves, we think of sin because we are inseparably linked to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet God shows us that the relationship between Christ and the church is apart from sin, for their relationship began in Genesis 2 not Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Adam was related to Eve in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, their relationship had nothing to do with sin, even as Christ and the church have nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we think of the church, we should never think of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In God's eyes the church has no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus' death for the sinner was for the remission of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But His death for the church was not for sin but for life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Genesis 3 we see the fig leaves and the skins of animals.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter four we see the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later, we see Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who is Isaac?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is he a type of the church, the Holy Spirit, redemption, or the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In reading the New Testament, we can see that Isaac somewhat typifies the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaac was not only born of Abraham or Sarah; he was born of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, Isaac somewhat resembles the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To Sarah, Isaac was his father's only begotten son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This again resembles the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To Abraham, everything that Isaac had was inherited; Isaac simply enjoyed his inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this respect he indeed resembles the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God sent the Holy Spirit to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit secured the church and espoused it to Christ as the Lamb's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Isaac's father sent his old servant to his own country and tribe to find a woman, Rebekah, to be Isaac's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is a correspondence here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we compare the Old Testament and the New Testament, we can find many things in the New Testament that match the Old Testament types.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Galatians, Isaac typifies the spiritual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ishmael typifies a fleshly walk in the church, while Isaac typifies a spiritual walk.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ishmael was begotten by Abraham through Hagar, that is, through the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He typifies man's own work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Isaac was born after Abraham gave up any hope of a child being born; he was born of God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, he typifies the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is just one example of types.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we go through the Bible chapter by chapter, we will find many different types.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The book that provides the most types is Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can say that Genesis is the nursery from which the seedlings of the whole Bible grow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The whole book of Exodus is a type of our salvation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Passover is a type of the breaking of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The crossing of the Red Sea is a type of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The murmuring and sojourning in the wilderness are types of God's children in their various conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The living water is a type of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The tabernacle is a type of our Lord Jesus while He sojourned on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is also a type of our sojourn in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The tabernacle did not have a floor, and it was pitched in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to wait until the New Jerusalem before we will see the streets of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While we are passing through this world, we have a glorious fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's goal for us is Canaan; He does not want us to remain in the wilderness.</S>
