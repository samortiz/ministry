   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 2 Timothy Paul also charged Timothy to cut straight the word of the truth 2:15 , which means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion, as a carpenter cutting wood perfectly straight without any crookedness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today some Bible interpreters cut the word of Scripture crookedly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is also an indication of the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, the Bible speaks of the spirit and the soul of man as two distinct parts 1Thes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>5:23; Heb 4:12 , yet some people distortedly say that the spirit and the soul are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Another example is that the Bible says that Christ became the Spirit in His resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b , yet some insist to say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are separate Persons and therefore Christ is not the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not to cut straight the word of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul also said to "pursue...with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart" 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not having a pure heart and not calling on the Lord also indicate the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Finally, Paul said, "The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Grace be with you" 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not experience the Lord's being with our spirit and therefore lose the presence of grace, that is the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to be careful about this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our highest enjoyment and experience is that our Lord is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord, who is the Creator of heaven and earth, the sovereign Lord of all, is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a tremendous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord's being with us is not in our mind or our thoughts; He as the Spirit is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Over thirty years ago I came to the United States with a specific burden, that is, to speak concerning the two spirits, the divine Spirit and our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In those days many American saints said that they never knew that man has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank God, we have been fighting here for thirty-four years, and now it is more common for Christians to refer to the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Recently, the Lord also has shown us that the secret of experiencing God's organic salvation lies in "the Spirit with our spirit" Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today, Christ is the Spirit, and if we want to experience and enjoy Him, we must be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can testify that, according to my age, without the Spirit's being with my spirit, I could not bear the burden of the Lord's recovery and the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some have advised me not to have so many activities, but I thank and praise the Lord that it is the Lord as the Spirit with me who enables me to have such activities.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As soon as I rise from my bed, I say, "O Lord, I rise with You."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The moment I touch the floor, I say, "O Lord, not only do I walk by You, but I walk with You.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You are holding me while I am walking."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the Lord were not the Spirit but were far away in heaven, what would He have to do with me?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thank the Lord, today the Lord is the Spirit, and we can enjoy Him in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is an exceedingly great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To enjoy the Lord's Spirit being in our spirit is to have grace with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When this is lost, the degradation of the church is present.</S>
