   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thy love is so prevailing,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>E'en Thyself with me to blend!</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This hymn says that the Lord's love has blended us with Him and made us one with Him.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The real blessing in God's New Testament economy is that Christ has made Himself one with us and has made us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Timothy 3:16 speaks of the great mystery of godliness, which is the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are the flesh, yet God made us, the flesh, His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is the fullness of the One who fills all in all Eph 1:22b-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This fullness is Christ's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What a wonder it is that God made us men of flesh His expression!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to remember that the Word who was God became flesh John 1:14 and lived in this flesh for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He died in the flesh 1 Pet 3:18; Col 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If He had not died in the flesh, we would have no share in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because He died in the flesh, that indicates He died with us Gal 2:20a .</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God became a man, and by dispensing Himself into us He made us God-men, men who are one with God, having God within us as our life and nature Col 3:4a; 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I thank God that we live in such an age, the age of the great mystery of godliness, the age of God manifesting Himself in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this age we do not need to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, and Christ today is realized as the life-giving Spirit, the consummated, compounded Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we are one with this compound Spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many in today's Christianity still remain in the Old Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They do not understand the Lord's words in John 14 17, and they do not understand Paul's fourteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, they do not understand the significance of our being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have believed and have been baptized into Christ, and now we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Christ everything is okay; outside of Him everything is a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all need to be turned from the human concept of uplifting the law to the divine concept of exalting Christ according to the divine revelation.</S>
