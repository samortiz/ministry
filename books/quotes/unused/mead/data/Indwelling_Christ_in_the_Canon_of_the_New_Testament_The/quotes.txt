[1]  The Indwelling Christ in the Canon of the New Testament CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE SEVEN STEPS OF GOD S PURPOSE Scripture Reading: Matt 1:23; 28:19-20; John 1:1, 14; 14:16-20; 15:4a, 5a; Rom 8:9-10a; 2 Cor 13:5
[3]  I have a deep sense that many of us need to see something deeper in our spirit.
[4]  The Scriptures not only tell us who God is and what kind of God He is, but also who man is and from what source he came.
[5]  One thing we must realize is that when God gets into us, we eventually become no more individualistic.
[6]  We have seen the seven steps that God has taken in Christ to fulfill His purpose.
[7]  When Christ came, He was the very embodiment of God.
[8]  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God John 1:1 .
[9]  But anyone who does not confess that Christ is God is not our brother.
[10]  Without Christ and outside of Christ we simply cannot find God.
[11]  So many Christians have the God-Redeemer Christ, but they do not realize the God-Redeemer-Life-giving Spirit Christ.
[12]  Do you think that God was God, and that Christ in the flesh was merely Christ in the flesh?
[13]  If we are going to experience the indwelling Christ, we must realize that Christ today is the very God who became our Redeemer, and is now the life-giving Spirit who is indwelling us.
[14]  CHAPTER THREE THE BAPTISM AND THE INDWELLING Scripture Reading: Matt 3:11a; 28:19-20b; Rom 6:3, 4a; Gal 3:27-28; 1 Cor 12:13a
[15]  We have seen that God took two steps in order to work Himself into us to be our life.
[16]  Jesus was the last Adam in the flesh, but through death and resurrection He was made the life-giving Spirit.
[17]  He became flesh for our redemption, and He became the life-giving Spirit to impart His life into us.
[18]  We have heard many messages about redemption in Christianity, but we have never heard that Jesus as the last Adam was made the life-giving Spirit in order to impart Himself into us as life.
[19]  I would like to quote something from Marvin R. Vincent s book entitled, Word Studies of the New Testament.
[20]  To be put into the Triune God simply means to be put into Christ Himself, and to be put into Christ Himself is to be put into the one Body.
[21]  By baptism, we have been put into the Triune God, but this putting in also includes the termination.
[22]  Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
[23]  When we were baptized into Christ, we were terminated in Him and buried in Him.
[24]  CHAPTER FOUR DRINKING FOR THE INDWELLING Scripture Reading: John 7:37-39; 14:10, 17, 20; 1 Cor 12:13b; Rev 22:17; Gal 2:20a THE START IN MATTHEW
[25]  Then, from verse 17 of John chapter fourteen, the Lord begins to reveal to us that He will become the Spirit of Reality: And I will pray the Father and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
[26]  In John 7:37-39, the Lord speaks about drinking.
[27]  But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Spirit was not yet; because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[28]  By baptism we were put into Christ, and by drinking we get Christ into us.
[29]  Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours 1 Cor 1:2 .
[30]  CHAPTER FIVE LIVING BY THE INDWELLING CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 6:57; 14:17-20; 15:4a, 5
[31]  From the past messages, we see that most Christian teachings have altogether missed the mark.
[32]  Regardless of whether we are saved or not, God s intention is still the same, that is, to work Himself into us as our life.
[33]  Some may feel that they know all of this already, but I am afraid that it is only a kind of doctrine to them.
[34]  When we call, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, the Triune God comes into us, mingles with us, and is one with us.
[35]  We all have the same life, because we all have Christ within us.
[36]  CHAPTER SIX THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN ACTS Scripture Reading: Acts 1:5, 8; 6:3; 7:55; 9:4-5; 11:24; 13:52; 16:6-7
[37]  We have seen something of the indwelling Christ in the four Gospels.
[38]  Then the Gospel of John tells us that this Triune God is today the life-giving Spirit to dwell within us.
[39]  If we confess and apply the blood to all our sinfulness, we are in Christ and Christ is in us.
[40]  Wherever we go, we must be a people who are full of the Holy Spirit.
[41]  We must be those who are in Jesus, and Jesus is living within us.
[42]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN ROMANS Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10, 17; 6:3-6a; 8:1, 2, 9-11, 16, 23; 12:5-6 GOSPELS, ACTS, EPISTLES
[43]  The Gospels show us how Christ became a man that we could be put into Him, and how He became the Spirit so that He could come into us.
[44]  Following this, the Acts show us a group of people who have been baptized into the Triune God, and now He is indwelling them as their life and they become His expression.
[45]  The goal is the Body of Christ, and the way from justification by faith to the Body of Christ is the indwelling of Christ.
[46]  We all realize that Jesus died on the cross for our sins.
[47]  So, through His death we received forgiveness from our sins, and we were reconciled to God.
[48]  But after His death, He was resurrected to become the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 to live within us.
[49]  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.
[50]  We all have been put into Christ, and now we are in Christ.
[51]  In Christ there is no condemnation because in Christ there is nothing negative, dark or sinful.
[52]  But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
[53]  Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[54]  And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness Rom 8:9-10 .
[55]  Christ is the Spirit, Christ is the life, and Christ is also the taste.
[56]  So many times we read in Christ, in Christ, in Christ Jesus, in the Lord, in the Lord.
[57]  Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ Rom 15:5-6 .
[58]  We must now look at the matter of the indwelling Christ in 1 Corinthians.
[59]  We all have been baptized into the Triune God, and now this Triune God is fully realized in the life-giving Spirit, who indwells us as our life in order that the Body of Christ may come into being.
[60]  This Christ in whom we are participating is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[61]  Then 1 Corinthians tells us that it is of God that we are in Christ.
[62]  But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption 1 Cor 1:30 .
[63]  God has put us into Christ, and now this Christ has been made our power, our wisdom, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption.
[64]  We should never consider that the Spirit of God here is separate from Christ or other than Christ.
[65]  The very Christ who is made everything to us is now in our spirit.
[66]  Now we see that this Spirit is Christ as the life-giving Spirit.
[67]  I would even say that this is the deepest book, telling us how a person lived by Christ.
[68]  And we know that this person who lived by Christ was the Apostle Paul.
[69]  Paul taught us much in Romans and 1 Corinthians that God s intention is to work Christ into us that we may experience Him as our life, our person, and our everything!
[70]  This will produce the church life, and then the individual Christ will become the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ.
[71]  Regardless of how spiritual we are, we must remember that we are fallen.
[72]  In doing everything, including the Lord s work, we expect it to be one way, but it turns out to be another.
[73]  We all have been terminated in the Triune God.
[74]  But in telling us of his life, Paul did give us a hint about some of the things we have in Christ.
[75]  While he is testifying of the kind of life he has in Christ, spontaneously he reveals some things about Christ to us.
[76]  Paul continues by saying that the Lord Jesus is the transforming Spirit.
[77]  But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .
[78]  But the living Christ has come into us not to confine us, but to transform us, to change our life.
[79]  But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us 2 Cor 4:7 .
[80]  Paul tells us that we are the vessels, and the Lord Jesus within us is the treasure.
[81]  But the key to this verse is the verse preceding it: to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ 2 Cor 4:6 .
[82]  For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: to the one we are the savor of death unto death; and to the other the savor of life unto life 2 Cor 2:14-16 .
[83]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN GALATIANS 1 Scripture Reading: Gal 1:4, 13-14, 15a, 16a; 2:20a; 3:24, 27, 28; 4:19; 5:2, 4 RELIGION
[84]  We have seen that in the book of 2 Corinthians, Paul gives us a record of his life, showing us how he experienced the indwelling Christ.
[85]  After this, in the book of Galatians, he still is speaking about the indwelling Christ, but with a specific aspect.
[86]  This means that if we would be a person like Paul, living by Christ and taking Him as our person, we must be aware of religion.
[87]  Religion is simply to worship God, to work for God, to keep the law, and to improve ourselves and do so many good things religiously without the presence of Christ.
[88]  Paul made it clear to the Galatians that there should be no more religion, no more law, no more regulations, no more traditions, and no more ordinances.
[89]  They have not been baptized into religion, but into Christ Gal 3:27 .
[90]  And as many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
[91]  Regardless of whether we have Christ within us, if we still live by our wisdom, our thinking, our emotion, this means that the religious snare has deprived us of all the benefits of the indwelling Christ.
[92]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN GALATIANS 2 Scripture Reading: Gal 3:2-3, 5a, 14; 4:6; 5:5, 16, 24-25; 6:1a, 8, 15, 18 FROM CHRIST TO THE SPIRIT
[93]  We have seen from the last message that Galatians is a book on the indwelling Christ.
[94]  In the first part of the book, Paul speaks much about Christ.
[95]  By reading this book carefully, we see that whatever has been accomplished on the cross, and all that the Lord has obtained and attained, is mentioned as the work of Christ.
[96]  But when Christ is experienced by us, Paul changes from Christ to the Spirit.
[97]  When we speak of His work on the cross, His accomplishment of redemption, His resurrection, and our being baptized into Him, we speak of Christ.
[98]  But when we go on to speak of the practical experiences of Christ, we change from Christ to the Spirit.
[99]  When we come to a meeting that ministers the Spirit to us, we may forget what we have heard doctrinally, yet we still have something within us it is the processed God as the Spirit that has been ministered into us.
[100]  The Spirit was promised, the Spirit is now being ministered, and the Spirit must be received.
[101]  The book of Galatians starts negatively with the evil age of religion, and it closes positively with the human spirit.
[102]  We have been delivered out of religion, which was mostly in our mind, to the wonderful enjoyment of Christ in our spirit.
[103]  But in our spirit we have the living Spirit as the reality of Christ.
[104]  Then verse 14 says, But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
[105]  God s will is to reveal Christ into us, to have Christ live in us, and to have Christ formed in us.
[106]  God s intention is to work Christ into us, but Satan s subtlety is to use religion to keep us away from Christ.
[107]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN EPHESIANS 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 3:8b, 10-11, 16-17a, 19b; 1:13b-14; 4:30; 5:18b; 6:17-18 THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST
[108]  Almost everyone knows that the subject of Ephesians is the Body of Christ.
[109]  How does the Body of Christ come into being?
[110]  The source from which the Body of Christ comes into existence is the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[111]  That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may make His home in your hearts by faith Eph 3:16-17a .
[112]  It is wonderful that we can say that Christ is in us, but we may only have Christ at the center, in our spirit.
[113]  According to God s economy, the Body of Christ must have a living person who is so real, practical, living, and available.
[114]  This is why God s intention is that Christ make His home in us.
[115]  It is not a matter of whether we are right or wrong; it is a matter of having Christ as a living person spreading into our whole being.
[116]  The problem is that we try to be so right, yet we do not have Christ making His home in our heart.
[117]  When we believed in Jesus Christ, at that very moment, God put the Holy Spirit into us as a seal.
[118]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN EPHESIANS 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17, 22-23; 2:15-16, 18-22; 4:3-4, 15-16, 23-24; 5:29 THE REAL BODY-LIFE
[119]  The book of Ephesians shows us clearly that the church is the Body of Christ.
[120]  And we have seen that this Body comes out of the enjoyment of all the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[121]  Most Christians have seen the fact that the church is the Body of Christ.
[122]  Therefore, if we don t know how to enjoy the riches of Christ, we may have the doctrine of the Body of Christ, but it would be impossible to have the real experience of the Body-life.
[123]  So we must see that to realize the real church life, the real Body-life, we need the experience of Christ as the indwelling One.
[124]  If we would enjoy Christ more, and then share what we have enjoyed of Christ with people, this would nourish them, and we would see more building up.
[125]  In the book of Ephesians, the Body of Christ is clearly revealed in chapter one.
[126]  And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all Eph 1:22-23 .
[127]  We have to come back to the book of Ephesians again and again to see that only the riches of Christ experienced by us can produce the Body of Christ.
[128]  Till we all arrive at the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ....But holding the reality in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: out from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by every joint of supply, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh growth of the body unto the building up of itself in love Eph 4:12-13, 15-16 .
[129]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN PHILIPPIANS Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21; 2:5, 13-14; 3:8, 10; 4:4-7, 12-13
[130]  We have seen in the past messages that by the time we come to Ephesians, the church has come into being through the indwelling of Christ.
[131]  He has presented to us the all-inclusive Christ, and he has showed us the Body, the church.
[132]  For the problem of the practical church life, Paul told the Philippians that all the things which happened to him would turn to his salvation through their prayer and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[133]  We all must realize that the Spirit of Jesus Christ is more bountifully rich than just the Spirit of God.
[134]  In one sense the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of God, but in another sense there is a great difference.
[135]  Before the Lord was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected, the Spirit was the Spirit of God.
[136]  Paul tells us that the practical way to have the church life is to know that in whatever circumstances we are, we have within us the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[137]  But we must pray, and have others pray for us, that we will realize the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[138]  After this, verse 13 of the same chapter says, For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.
[139]  In this book, some verses speak of Christ s indwelling, one speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit, and here is a verse that says that God is working in us.
[140]  It is so simple: when the Spirit works, that is Christ working, and when Christ works, that is God working.
[141]  Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may gain Christ.
[142]  It is by this experience of gaining Christ that we also know the fellowship of His suffering.
[143]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN COLOSSIANS Scripture Reading: Col 1:12, 18-19, 27; 2:2b, 6, 8-9; 3:4a, 10-11
[144]  In these epistles we see how Christ must be wrought into us as our life; then we will learn to live by Him, taking Him as our person.
[145]  Christ is the beginning, Christ is the ending, and Christ must have the preeminence.
