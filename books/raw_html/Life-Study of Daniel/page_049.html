<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Successors of the Male Goat</H2><P>Verses 8b through 14 speak of the successors of the male goat.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In the Place of the Great Horn,<br>Four Conspicuous Ones Coming Up<br>toward the Four Winds of Heaven</H2><P>In the place of the great horn, four conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of heaven (v. 8b; 11:4). This signifies that in the place of Alexander the Great, his four generals (corresponding to the four wings and the four heads in 7:6), Cassander, Lysimachus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus, rose up from the four ends of his empire to form nations in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Egypt, and Syria, respectively. According to the human point of view, the Grecian Empire ended with the death of Alexander the Great. But in the sight of God, the Grecian Empire continued to exist in the four empires formed by Alexander the Great's four generals. Eventually, these four empires were merged and formed into two empires, one on the south (Egypt) and the other on the north (Syria). Chapter eleven describes the warfare between these two empires in the territory of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. A Little Horn Coming Forth<br>out of One of the Four Horns</H2><P>Out of one of the four horns came forth a little horn (8:9a). This little horn signifies Antiochus Epiphanes from Syria in 175-164 B.C.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Growing Very Great<br>toward the South, toward the East,<br>and toward That Which Is Beautiful</H2><P>The little horn grew very great toward the south, toward the east, and toward that which is beautiful (v. 9b). This signifies that he expanded very much toward Egypt on the south, toward Syria on the east, and toward Israel, which is beautiful. The expression "that which is beautiful" refers to the beautiful land of Israel.</P>
