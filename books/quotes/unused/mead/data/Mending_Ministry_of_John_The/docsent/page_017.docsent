   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we come to John 15:26 the Spirit is brought in. "When the Comforter comes, Whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality Who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me." The Greek preposition translated twice here as "from" has no precise English equivalent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It means "from with."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit comes from and with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The two cannot be separated; when the Spirit comes, the Father comes.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Son is the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit is the vine's life juice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This great vine is the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All that the Father is is in this organism, embodied in this vine, which is the second of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Within the vine is the circulating life flow of the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The branches unquestionably have the life and nature of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since God is our Father, we surely have His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are members of the Body of Christ.</S>
