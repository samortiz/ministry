<h2 class="head2">Jiao County, Shantung Province</h2><p>Dear Sisters Ruth and Phoebe in the Lord:</p><p>Hallelujah, praise the Lord! He has heard my supplication and provided a brother to travel with me. He is Brother Tseng Jin-yi. He is going to Hwang County through Tsingtao and Chefoo. On the seventh we boarded the boat; Sister Cheng Feng-yi and Brother Shen sent us on our way. It was raining hard, and it hurt me to see them laboring so much. I could only thank the Lord on the one hand and accept their love on the other hand. After I arrived in Tsingtao, I stayed at my sister's house. On the morning of the thirteenth, I took the train, got off at a little after 10:00 a.m., and took the bus at 11:30 a.m. At 1:00 p.m. I got off the bus, and I arrived home by 3:30 p.m. Thank and praise the Lord, we have seen His guidance and provision in everything. The Lord has graced me and my whole family. The Lord stopped my father through someone's hand from doing something improper. It has to do with some family affairs. Humanly speaking, my father was fully justified in bringing the matter to court. But the gracious Lord stopped this action through a visiting friend. After I returned home and saw my father, I told him what kind of stand a Christian should take. We all felt that it was the Lord who had stopped this course of action. I am so happy. Thank and praise Him! Although men sometimes believe in Him foolishly, He nevertheless grants grace to those who love Him, and He stops them from doing things that they should not do. His love is truly wonderful! Praise Him! I will write again later. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Sister Yu Fan-rue<br />November 15<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Two Letters Written<br />on a Journey to Ch'ang-sha</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>It has been five months since we parted in Shanghai. Through the Lord's protection we have been kept in safety. Are you busy? May the Lord bless you. My sister Jing-shia and I left Shanghai on August 19 for Wu-Shing. On the twentieth we experienced bombing by airplane in Sung-Jiang. But the Lord protected us, and we escaped the danger. We spent about three months in Hsieh Village in Wu-Shing. The fighting was approaching, and we left for An-Ji before Wu-Shing capitulated. After some time we left and walked several dozen miles a day through mountains and hills for three days. We eventually arrived in Hangchow. We took the night train across the Chien-Jiang and passed through Shiao-Shan and Lin-Pu, arriving at Jin-Hwa and Lan-Si. The journey took us over land and water, and we had no rest on the way. As soon as we arrived in Ning-Po, we heard that Jin-Hwa had been bombed. Then we left for Nanchang with four brothers, including Brother Chu Wen-yao and Sister Shen Hwei-min and others (for a total of seven). We waited for the train at Chien-Tang and slept outdoors, suffering the sun's heat for seven days before arriving at Ch'ang-sha. The journey was long and dangerous, but we were protected by the Lord. Thank and praise Him! After we arrived in Ch'ang-sha, we heard bad news again. We will stay here temporarily and follow the Lord's leading. What is your opinion about the present political situation? Where would be the safest place for us to go? Please instruct us. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>A brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Jing-yuen<br />December 17<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Sister Lee in the Lord:</p><p>Peace to you! I wonder whether you have received the letter I wrote you from Lan-Si? I stayed in Lan-Si for a short time and left with the Chang sisters and the four sons of Chu Kwang-hwa for Ch'ang-sha. Along the way we encountered many difficulties, but we experienced the presence of the almighty God. He led us through many difficult crises. We are full of thanksgiving and praise to Him! We are prepared to move on, but we would like to know whether the route to Szechuan or to Hong Kong is the safest. What is the way to get to these places? Are there brothers and sisters from Hankow planning to move to Hong Kong? Would they be willing to take us along by passing through Ch'ang-sha? Please pray for us. I am separated from my family and by myself in a strange place. Sometimes I experience unspeakable suffering. I can only pray for God to comfort me. I could never have imagined that I would be separated from my family this way. Fortunately, I believe in the Lord and can still find joy and peace in Christ. Peace to you in the Lord. Greetings to Mr. Nee and Miss Chang.</p><p>Hwei-min<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>By the time the above two letters arrived in Hankow, I had moved to Chungking. Brother Lan sent them to me via airmail. After I read them, I thanked God for protecting them on the one hand, and I remembered them much on the other hand. I have sent a letter back to them, but the mail takes time, and I have no assurance that they will receive it. Yesterday, I received a letter from Hankow that said that Brother Chu Wen-yao is waiting for a train to go to Hong Kong.</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />December 30<br />in Chungking</p>
