   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Following the training in October, the trainees returned to their respective places throughout China, taking with them the help they had received.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Wherever they went, they spread the revival.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The result was a tremendous spiritual explosion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hundreds of sinners were captured for the Lord's kingdom, many believers were set on fire for the Lord's recovery, and the churches were increased and built up more than ever before.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was Watchman's first training in Kuling Mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His burden was to conduct this kind of training at least once a year on an ongoing basis.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The situation then required him to postpone the time of the second training from February to August 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The content of this training was the same as that of the first, with some improvements.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The trainees were a different group of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the midst of the training, he moved it from Kuling Mountain to his home at Customs Lane within the city of Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the second training was completed, due to the political change, he had no more opportunity to continue his training.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although his training plan was terminated, what he released during his two trainings at Kuling were printed and have become a great help to many who are seeking to follow the Lord in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The issue of those trainings is invaluable to us today.</S>
