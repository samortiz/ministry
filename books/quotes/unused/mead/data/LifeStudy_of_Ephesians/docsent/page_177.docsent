   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now trace the basic factors and the basic elements in chapters one, two, and three.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The major factor in chapter one is the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The infinite, unlimited, eternal power that raised Christ from among the dead, uplifted Him to the third heaven, and made Him the Head over all things, is to the church which is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order for the church to be the Body, the church must have the well-speaking of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the major factor in chapter one is the church as the Body of Christ, and the basic element is the well-speaking of the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>GOD S DWELLING PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In chapter two we see various aspects of the church: the masterpiece, the new man created by Christ on the cross, the commonwealth of God, the kingdom where the citizens have civil rights and responsibilities, the household of God, and finally the dwelling place of God, God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although all these aspects are covered, the major factor in chapter two is the church as the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be God s habitation, the church must have both resurrection and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These are the basic elements in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the first part of the chapter the main concept is that of resurrection life, and in the second part the main thought is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both are necessary for the church to be the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE FULLNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In chapter three, the deepest chapter in Ephesians, the major factor is the church as the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For the church to be the fullness of God, we need the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the unsearchable riches of Christ are the basic element in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE CHURCH LIFE ACCORDING TO GOD S DESIRE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us review the major factors and the basic elements in the six chapters of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapter one the major factor is the church as the Body of Christ, and the basic element is the well-speaking of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In chapter two the major factor is the church as the habitation of God, and the basic elements are resurrection and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter three the major factor is the church as the fullness of God, and the basic element is the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter four the major factor is the church as the new man, and the basic elements are grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter five the major factor is the church as the Bride, and the basic elements are love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Finally, in chapter six the major factor is the church as the warrior, and the basic elements are might and the armor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because the church life as the Bride in love and light requires something fine and intimate, Paul uses married life as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In married life there is no place for might or for armor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Neither are such things characteristic of the church as the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the church as the Bride there is no emphasis on grace, truth, nor even the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, there is no mention of resurrection, the Spirit, nor the well-speaking of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Specifically what is required here is God Himself as love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we have pointed out, love is the inner essence of God, and light is the element of God expressed visibly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we get into God to touch His inner substance, we experience Him as love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The proper church life should be in this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why then does Paul include chapter six?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This chapter is necessary because God s enemy remains to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there were no enemy, we could stop with the church as the Bride in chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to Revelation 19, the warrior who fights with Christ in the battle against the enemy is firstly the Bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that firstly we must be the Bride in love and in light, and then we can go forth as the warrior with Christ to war against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, a couple, Christ and His Bride, will defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May we all be impressed that the church life according to God s desire must be in love and in light, both of which are the very elements of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the inner substance of God we have love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here we have the top church life, the church as the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The goal of the book of Ephesians is to bring us into God s inner substance to know Him as love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here we are to live in intimate fellowship as we enjoy the shining light and love in its sweetness.</S>
