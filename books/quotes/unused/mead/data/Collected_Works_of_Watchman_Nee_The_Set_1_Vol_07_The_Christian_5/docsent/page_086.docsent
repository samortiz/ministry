   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWELVE BASKETS FULL 5 Issue No. 9 MEDITATION ON CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The four Gospels display the perfect life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Gospel of Matthew depicts Him as the King; the Gospel of Mark, as the Servant; the Gospel of Luke, as Man; and the Gospel of John, as God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One of our frequent failures in reading the Gospels is to pay brief attention to the words and deeds of Christ only.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Indeed, His words and deeds are enough to capture our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But to do only this is a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Seldom do we see Christ Himself, and seldom do we behold the Christ that we ought to behold.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reason we study these writings on Christ's words and deeds is that we would know the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This being the case, let us spend some time to meditate on the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, let us meditate on the inspired writings of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Next, we have to meditate on the Christ who is revealed through these writings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should sit back quietly, open up the Holy Book, and read a portion of the record of our Lord's excellent life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should meditate on His wisdom, grace, patience, love, beauty, gentleness, tenderness, meekness, and sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should meditate on Him until His life jumps out of the pages and our hearts burn in love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is precious, He is lovely, and He is refined.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should meditate on Him until His fine acts come alive before our eyes and deeply attract us, to the extent that we would desire Him alone and would feel at a loss with anything less than a full possession of Him and a full taste of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should meditate on His acts, to the extent that our life bears the same kindness and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We see the Lord's wisdom in His answer concerning the source of His authority, and we see the wonder of His judgment in His answer concerning paying tribute to Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All His acts are fully lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who meditate on Him will not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May we know our Savior more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>FULL CARE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Coarseness is something that has no place in godly living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before believers allow God's grace to work in their lives, they have many hard and unrefined areas.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be negligent, to be inconsiderate of others, and to neglect caring for others are the common illnesses of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, these are things that even the most spiritual saints often neglect.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a person is only slightly careless, he will find himself unable to tend to everything properly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All those who are unable to control their mind properly have this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be negligent is a characteristic of those who do not have full control of their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These people are mostly undisciplined in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their thoughts are complicated, and they themselves do not have the ability to concentrate and to integrate ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since they are careless in their considerations, in many areas they become negligent and show impropriety in the way they treat others and handle matters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another major reason for negligence is to pay too much attention to oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because a person cares too much for his own convenience, he neglects others' needs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While others are asleep, they make noises and disturb others unthinkingly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These noises may even be from praying or studying the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When meetings are called, they keep others waiting for a long time while they tend to their own private affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to maintain their own name, they open their mouth to slander others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to preserve their own interests, they extort and cause damage to others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because these ones do not have the spirit of the cross, without realizing it they neglect others and do not think of others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes such behavior can even come from a sincere heart!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet they are bound to cause others embarrassment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many times we think that negligence is just frankness, simplicity, and informality!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet coarseness is never the fruit of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What the saints should seek after is that in everything they would be careful, considerate, sensitive not to cause others inconvenience, not to leave their own self-will unchecked, and not to embarrass others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord's cross and the Holy Spirit have a grinding power which can cause the most coarse person in the world to become tender.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, in order to be careful in everything and to be sensitive and caring, there must be the real dying to the self.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only then will a person not care for his own interest and be willing to suffer and to seek for others' benefit in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should exercise our will to control our mind, so that we will not become negligent unconsciously of others' needs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"So then death operates in us, but life in you" 2 Cor 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord's committing of His mother to the care of others John 19:26-27 is a real example to us!</S>
