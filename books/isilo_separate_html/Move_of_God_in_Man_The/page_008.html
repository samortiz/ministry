God the Spirit Having Joined the Incarnation</H2><P>God the Spirit also joined the incarnation. In Luke 1:35 the angel told Mary that the Holy Spirit would come upon her as the power for her to conceive the holy child. Matthew 1:18 and 20 tell us further that Mary "was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit" and that "that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit." This indicates that the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit had been begotten in Mary's womb before she delivered the child Jesus. The incarnation was of the Son of God, but it was carried out by the Spirit. The Spirit also participated in the incarnation.</P><P>Now we can see that the entire Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;was incarnated. All three participated in the incarnation. When we say "God's move in man," we mean the Triune God's move in man, the move of the Three of the Divine Trinity. God's incarnation was the start of God's direct move in man. The Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;all came out of eternity with divinity to enter into a human being to be one with man, to make Himself a man, and to participate in man's nature (Heb. 2:14a). This is so great and is far beyond our natural thought and understanding. God came in a silent way, in a secret way, and even in a small way. He came in His Divine Trinity to enter into a human being and be born there. By this He made Himself one with man and a part of man. From the time of His incarnation, He began not only to be in man but also to be a man.</P><P>God's move on earth in man according to the New Testament record is always in the principle of incarnation. Our salvation is the move of God in man and is the move of God to be a part of man. If God had never become us in the sense of coming into us to be our very life, we could never have been saved. Every time a person is saved, the incarnation is repeated again. What is salvation, or regeneration? It is God coming into a man in His divinity to make Himself a part of that man and to make that man a part of Him. Salvation brings God into man and brings man into God. Salvation makes God man that man may be made God (but not the Godhead). This is incarnation, and this principle of incarnation should be applied to our entire Christian life.</P><P>In the Christian life the husbands and the wives should love each other, but in their natural life they are not capable of doing this. What husband can love his wife, and what wife can love her husband? If a Christian husband really loves his wife, that is not him. This means that he is living in the principle of Galatians 2:20&#151;"I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." For a husband to love his wife in this way is in the principle of incarnation. Unless God is made you and you are made God, you can never really love your wife. We have to realize that we can never be really humble. Real humility is in the principle of incarnation. If I am really humble, that means God has made Himself me, and He has also made me Himself. This is the strong principle of incarnation, and this is God's move. Without Christ making Himself us and without us being made Christ, we cannot be humble and we cannot have any kind of Christian virtue. Every Christian virtue we have is a part of the incarnation. Every day as we live the Christian life, the Triune God is being incarnated by being made us and by making us Him. God is being made man and man is being made God. When a brother really loves his wife, at that time he is God in God's life and nature but not in His Godhead. In other words, God has been made him, and he has been made God. This is the move of God in man in the principle of incarnation.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
