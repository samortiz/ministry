<h2 class="head1">III. BEING BROUGHT ON TO MATURITY</h2><p>The writer did not open this book by telling the Hebrew believers to go on. Before he said, &ldquo;Let us be brought on to maturity,&rdquo; he used five chapters to cover many wonderful items. The way to be brought on to maturity is in these five chapters.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Sharing with Christ<br />in His Attainments</h2><p>In order to be brought on to maturity, we need to share with Christ in His attainments (1:9; 3:14). We are His partners and we share His anointing. The way to share with Him in His attainments is by faith. We do not need to understand that much. We simply need to believe the word which is the glad tidings for us today and say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, I am His partner. I have the position and the right to share with Him in His anointing.&rdquo; Do not say that you lack the feeling of participating in His anointing. The more you say that you do not have the feeling, the less feeling you will have. Faith calls things not being as being. We believe what the word of God says, whether we feel it or not. The word of God says that we are a partner of Christ, and to this we must say, &ldquo;Amen. I am a partner of Christ.&rdquo; The word of God also says that He has been anointed and that, as His partners, we share in His anointing. To this we must also say, &ldquo;Amen. I have a share in His anointing.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Diligent to Enter into<br />the Remaining Sabbath Rest</h2><p>If we would be brought on to maturity, we must be diligent to enter into the remaining Sabbath rest (4:9, 11). As we have seen, the remaining Sabbath rest today is the church life. We do not need to be that concerned about the coming kingdom in the future; we simply need to get into the church life today. Do not say, &ldquo;Oh, in the past years I have been so sloppy. I hope I can still make it to enter into the kingdom in the future.&rdquo; You need to forget your past, not care for the future, and enter into the church life today. The enemy is subtle. I am afraid that many of us still talk about, our past and have expectations for the future. Let us forget them both and be diligent and take action to be in the church life and in the race today.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Coming Forward to the Throne of Grace<br />to Receive Mercy and Find Grace</h2><p>We also need to come forward to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace (4:16). To grow in life, to be brought on to maturity, we need both God&rsquo;s mercy and grace. It is impossible to grow by ourselves. It is God&rsquo;s far-reaching mercy and sufficient grace that can bring us on to maturity. And the way to receive mercy and find grace is to come forward to the throne of grace. Thank God that for us today His throne is the throne of grace. We all need to practice coming forward to the throne of grace that &ldquo;we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">D. Feeding on the Solid Food to Enjoy Christ<br />as Our High Priest according to the Order<br />of Melchisedec</h2><p>If we would grow to maturity, we need to leave the baby food, the word of the beginning, and feed on the solid word, the word of righteousness, in order to enjoy Christ as our High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec (5:9-10, 14). We have received Christ as our Redeemer and Savior, and He has come into us to be our life. This very Christ whom we have received as our life within is also our High Priest in the heavens according to the order of Melchisedec, whose function is not to offer the sacrifice for sin but to minister the riches of God for our supply. In order to grow into maturity we need to enjoy such a God-ministering Christ that we may participate in the riches of the divine element. This is the solid food, not the baby food. Most Christians stay on the baby food, not desiring the solid food and not experiencing anything of Christ as their Melchisedec. This book encourages us to go on by feeding on the solid food and enjoying the heavenly Christ that we may receive the rich element of God for our growth into maturity.</p><p>The beginning of chapter six is a strong conclusion encouraging us to practice all we have heard in the five foregoing chapters. If we do this and go on, we shall reach the goal and be matured. How simple this is! Let us all go on.</p>
