   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There Being No Reason and No Excuse for Any Kind of Division and No Justification for It</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is no reason, no excuse, and no justification for any kind of division in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regardless of what the reason is for division, that is not a legitimate reason in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No division is legitimate, and no division is justified, regardless of how strong our reason is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All problems in the church can and should be solved through proper and adequate fellowship by praying together sincerely and thoroughly Acts 15:1-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The proper prayer and fellowship without pride and self-interest, under the light of the pure word of the Scriptures, will solve every problem among us and preserve us in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Apostle Charging Us to Turn Away</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>from Those Who Make Divisions and</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>to Refuse a Sectarian Man</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Romans 16:17 the apostle charged us to turn away from those who make divisions, and in Titus 3:10 he charged us to refuse a sectarian man, after a first and second admonition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Romans 14:1 15:13, we need to receive all genuine believers, regardless of their different views concerning doctrine and outward practices.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we cannot tolerate any kind of division, because division is an insult to the person of the Triune God and a violation of the constitution of the Body of Christ and the practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the clear and definite word of the apostle Paul in Romans 16:17 and Titus 3:10, we need to turn away from those who purposely make divisions, and we also need to refuse those whose purpose in contacting others is to cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is according to the practice of the quarantining of lepers in the Old Testament typology Lev 13:45-46; Num 12:10-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because leprosy is very contagious, a leper was put aside temporarily for the profit of the whole congregation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a person is sick with a highly contagious disease, he should be quarantined, separated even from his family members, until he is healed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In like manner, if anyone is spiritually sick of the disease of division, having become a divisive person, he must be quarantined.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This will protect the entire church from the contagious germs of division, and the church will be safeguarded in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>6 brothers</S>
