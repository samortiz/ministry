At that time I answered that it is good and that it is all right to take up a second job. But this is not the question. The question is what is your primary work. Before God a person must have an intention and a purpose. Paul said that his intention, his desire, or we may say, ambition, and goal were to please the Lord. What was his purpose and ambition? He said, "To gain the honor of being well pleasing to Him'' (2 Cor. 5:9). The first question you need to answer today is, "Why are you doing business?'' Is it to earn money or to be rich? Some people want to become rich and not just earn money. Even many physicians in Shanghai are not simply for earning money but for becoming rich. Our purpose before God is not to become rich, but to earn money, to have a little income, and to support the Lord's work. This foundation must be established first. You must make a decision within yourself as to what you really want before the Lord. Paul said he wanted to please the Lord. What do you want? Today before the Lord I have only one purpose: I want to serve Him, and I want His work to be done well.</p><h2 class="head3">Occupation Being a Minor Issue</h2><p>Today all the brothers and sisters must deal with this issue&mdash;we must give all to serve the Lord. I tell you, if we do so, the matter of occupation is a small thing. What you do is a small thing. If you are not strong before the Lord and your service to God is not strong, your situation is like a work of silk weaving which cannot be touched without rending it. Once you touch it, there will be a tear. If before the Lord your service to Him is strong, even if you go back to work, the way is still open. Perhaps certain brothers may return to be physicians, to embroider, or to make hair nets. But if this is something you do on the side in order to support your service, there is no problem. This will not cause a problem for your ministry, because you are not in that occupation.</p><p>For example, soon our brothers will go back to take care of a linen or embroidery business. They are prepared to sell the product in order to use all that they have to support their office before God. Their function before God is so pressing and critical that everything else they do is to help their function. Again, there may be a person who has a hair net or embroidery business. He has set his heart and mind to become rich, yet he says, "I am the same as the other brothers. Because I want to be rich, I assume that the other brothers also desire to be rich and that there is no difference between us.'' I tell you, before God his way is wrong, and the carrying out of his office will be restricted. His purpose is to become rich, but our purpose is not to become rich. All occupations can be carried out in the same manner, but our way is for serving God.</p><h2 class="head3">Serving God in Whatever We Do</h2><p>If I want to serve God, I must serve God in whatever I do. You have to give all to this. Not only not making tents is for being an apostle, but even making tents is for being an apostle. Not only not fishing is for being an apostle, but even fishing is for being an apostle. Therefore, I hope none of the brothers who are apostles would change their priority before God. I also hope that none of the brothers who are serving God in the localities would change their priorities either. Serving God is our career, our basic career. Whatever I do is for serving God. Not making money is to serve God, and making money is also to serve God. Designating a certain portion of my time is also for serving God. If I walk in this way without an obstacle, I am serving God. If I walk in this way, find an obstacle, and change my means of walking, I am also serving God. I would even give my life. Thus, the issue is settled.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_083.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_085.html">Next</a> </body></html>
