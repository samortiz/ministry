   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ADVANCE OF GOD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING BY GOD'S POWER AND NOT OUR POWER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The advance of God's work can only be carried out by His power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can only accomplish God's will and purpose by means of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to accomplish God's will, not only must the beginning be of God, the process of carrying it out must also be according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can never fulfill God's will by our own ability.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once I went to Hong Kong with three hundred dollars in my pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I had to cross the harbor from Kowloon to Hong Kong, which cost five cents.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I asked a man to give me change, and he said that my money was no good.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I showed him the three hundred dollars, but he insisted that my money was useless.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He then told me that in Hong Kong only Hong Kong currency is accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is like the Chinese Customs Department which accepts only currency issued by the Chinese Central Bank.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The same kind of relationship exists between God's will and His power.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It does not matter how much "money" you have in your pocket, you cannot buy anything in God's kingdom with it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only God's power God's "money" will be accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even after a man knows God's will, there is still the danger that he will try to accomplish it by his own power, ideas, charisma, or eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Abraham's begetting of Ishmael is one example.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is where the problem lies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The starting point and final goal of a work may be according to God, but the means and power that a man uses to accomplish His will are of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every worker of the Lord must check with himself about the means that he uses to accomplish God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The goal of a work must be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the method and means by which we reach God's goal must also be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, we will commit the iniquity of the sanctuary by bringing the flesh into the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God said, "The stranger who comes near shall be put to death" Num 18:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The accomplishment of God's work has nothing to do with our power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The question is not how much we have done, but whether we have done something according to God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A brother said, "Only that which is from heaven can go back to heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A sister also said, "If the Lord comes, we can go home."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let me ask whether we will be going home or visiting as a guest when we go to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The answer lies in whether or not we come from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I came from the Lord, my return would be like going home.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, it would be like a visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I cannot say that I am returning to Amoy, because Amoy is not my home.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are to return to heaven, we must first come from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a man derives his strength from Adam, he can only return to Adam; he can never return to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A worker must remember that God's work can only be accomplished by God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Otherwise, no work can please God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE RESULT OF GOD'S WORK BEING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>FOR GOD'S GLORY AND NOT FOR OUR GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The initiation of God's work is His will and the advance of His work is His power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These two things have nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the same principle, the result of God's work is God's glory, not our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After I preached in a place, a brother came to me and said, "Brother Nee, you spoke so well tonight!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are you proud of it?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I did not answer him imme- diately, because no one had ever asked me such a question before.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I thought about it, and asked myself if I was proud of my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then I answered him, saying, "I have never thought about this question before.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps I am very proud, but I have never thought of it."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That evening I learned that as long as we are only for God's will and glory, we will never think of usurping His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we have the thought of usurping His glory, we will surely have a problem with the first and second point.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One thing which may be superfluous can be brought up at this point.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Why does God not allow man to be saved by works Eph 2:8-9 ?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is the purpose of God monopolizing the work of salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The purpose is that God wants to have all the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The amount of work one does determines the amount of glory he receives.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God does not want us to share His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, He does not allow us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why He has chosen the ones who are weak, foolish, and depised by the world for His work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First Corin- thians 1:29 says, "So that no flesh may boast before God."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God does not wish to see us getting the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He can give everything to man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is even willing to give His Son to man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But He will not give His glory to man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can only enter into the Lord's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may be very poor and weak, but as soon as we render a little help to some brothers and sisters and as soon as we save a few people, we begin to steal God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Stealing His glory is committing the iniquity of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is very easy for us to commit the sin of stealing the Lord's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>None of us wants to be a thief.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, stealing God's glory is the act of a thief.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God requires that we not only remove outward, evil acts, but also that we do not steal His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God is the God of all goodness, and we are men of all evil.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We can only say that all goodness is found in Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Stealing God's glory is committing the iniquity of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The showbread, lampstand, and incense altar are all Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Other than Christ, there is nothing in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God does not want us to have any glory of our own in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If a man enters the Holy of Holies, he should only see the ark, which is Christ, and the cherubim above the ark, which represent God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Everything that we see in the tabernacle is related to God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The temple was filled with God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In it we see only Christ; we do not even see the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The question today is who is qualified to share God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Last year God might have called some brothers to His work.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He might have given you the experience of the outpouring of the Spirit, and you might have received the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>During the past year, I have heard that many have worked for the Lord in a wonderful way, but I am afraid that some will begin to become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I am afraid that when some have more spiritual knowledge and experience, they will also increase in spiritual pride.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They have not yet seen God's will and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Therefore, they still work by themselves and seek their own glory.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Please listen to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It says that God "rejects" 1 Sam 15:23 , and "resists" the proud 1 Pet 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is difficult to find stronger words than these in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The word reject means to be finished with someone, whereas resist is a word that is used against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There is nothing more abominable in the eyes of God and nothing more evil in His work than pride.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We have no ground to stand on other than being in dust and ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In this world, everyone under Satan's deception is a proud person.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>A proud person does not know himself; those who know themselves will not be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When we come before God, we have to realize that everything we have is unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Unless the Lord's blood covers me constantly, I dare not work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In fact, I cannot even be a Christian if I do not have the covering of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>What do you have that is not from the Lord's grace?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Do you think that you are better than others in any way?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Are you holier than others in any way?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If God exposed everything within you, you would find out how much uncleanness there is within.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>During the past few days we talked about the excommunication of a certain brother.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Every time we came to God, we came with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Had it not been for the Lord's grace, we would have been worse than our brother is.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We are under God's grace today.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We cannot enter into God's glory yet.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We have to wait for the time of resurrection before we can obtain God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Today we can only remain humble and useless like Lazarus the beggar, who was always begging under the table.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We can only be those who receive and accept grace in true humility before His face.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>It is unfortunate that those who partake of God's work can commit the iniquity of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>How evil is the sin against the sanctuary!</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If you read Numbers 18, you will see that the punishment for sins committed in the sanctuary was primarily death.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The sin of coming near to the sanctuary results in death vv.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The sin against the sanctuary does not need to go through man's judgment; God judges it directly.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Those who come near to the sanctuary die immediately; there is no need for the priests to judge it.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Ordinary sins must pass through the priests' judgment, but the iniquity of the sanctuary is a direct offense against God, and God judges it directly.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Many sins offend God indirectly, but the iniquity of the sanctuary is a direct offense against God.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This is because the sanctuary belongs to God and the iniquity of the sanctuary is an infringement on God's glory and on God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This is a very serious matter; I can only speak of it under the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>I ask for the Lord's forgiveness, and I also ask for the brothers' forgiveness.</S>
