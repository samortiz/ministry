   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 Hated and Harassed</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by the Brothers to Whom He Ministers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although Joseph was a shepherd and the father's beloved and although he ministered to his brothers according to his father's will, he was hated and harassed by the brothers to whom he ministered 37:4-5, 8, 11, 18-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The same was true of Christ Acts 10:38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ was sent to minister to the children of God, but they hated Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the Gospels, the Jewish leaders hated Christ, conspired against Him, and plotted to kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was also Joseph's experience with his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 37:19 and 20 his brothers said, "Behold, this master of dreams cometh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Come now therefore, and let us slay him..."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, they conspired and plotted against their brother Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Joseph's brothers harassed him through the Ishmaelites, who were Midianites 37:25, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both the Ishmaelites and the Midianites were descendants of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Abraham had three wives: Sarah, Hagar, and Keturah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through Sarah, his genuine wife, Abraham brought forth Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through Hagar, Sarah's handmaid, he brought forth Ishmael, the product of Abraham's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Finally, through Keturah, Abraham brought forth Midian.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only one son Isaac was brought forth by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both Ishmael and Midian were brought forth through the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, in the Old Testament both Ishmael and Midian signify the flesh, the natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Joseph, a descendant of Isaac, was sold to the descendants of Ishmael and Midian, to the Ishmaelites, the Midianites.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It seems that the Bible erroneously uses the terms the Ishmaelites and the Midianites interchangeably.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter thirty-seven, verse 25 speaks of the Ishmaelites and verse 28, of the Midianites.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Were the ones to whom Joseph was sold Ishmaelites or Midianites?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Bible, both the Ishmaelites and the Midianites were of the same category.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the eyes of God the Ishmaelites and the Midianites both signify the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, Joseph was sold through the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The same thing happened to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the Jewish leaders had been in the spirit, they would never have delivered Jesus Christ to Pilate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ was delivered to Pilate by the Jewish leaders through the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Jewish leaders delivered Jesus to Pilate, they were no longer Israelites; they were Ishmaelites and Midianites.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their delivering up of the Lord Jesus was done in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Joseph was sold through the flesh to Egypt 37:28, 36 , which signifies the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fact that Joseph was sold through the flesh to the world indicates that the flesh is linked to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was the same in the case of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through the flesh, the Jewish leaders delivered Christ to Pilate, the Roman authority, who certainly was in Egypt, that is, in the world.</S>
