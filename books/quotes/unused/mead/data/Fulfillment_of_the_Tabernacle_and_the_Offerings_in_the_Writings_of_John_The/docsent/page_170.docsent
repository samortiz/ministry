   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-SIX THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN 11 Scripture Reading: John 15:1 16:4 A SIGN OF CHRIST'S UNIVERSAL SPREADING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the sixth sign in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John the sign of the true vine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This sign is related to the spreading of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whereas most trees grow vertically, a vine spreads by growing horizontally.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, a cedar tree shoots upward into the sky, but a vine grows along the surface of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the growth of the vine is a matter of its spreading to cover the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter fifteen of John's Gospel we do not have a cedar tree; we have a vine tree spreading on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While visiting London in 1958, I was taken by a friend to see the Queen's Vine, which is housed in a large glass room.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My friend boasted to me concerning this vine and asked what I thought of it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I answered, "This vine is not a surprise to me, for I have seen a much greater vine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Queen's Vine is rather small, and the greenhouse in which it is located is not very large.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the vine I have seen is so vast, so immense, that it covers the entire globe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Have you seen this vine?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, the vine I was referring to is the true vine, the vine revealed in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In John 15:1 the Lord Jesus says, "I am the true vine."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only Christ is the true vine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Any other vine is false.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the true vine, the Lord is permanent, but other vines, including the Queen's Vine, are temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is on earth one vine that is permanent, and this vine is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the universal vine spreading over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unbelievers may think that we are dreaming when we say that Christ is the universal vine covering the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But this is not a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today there are millions of Christians around the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was restricted to traveling in a small area.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But now Christ has spread throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Can you name a country to which Christ as the universal vine has not spread?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wherever we may go we can see the spreading of the universal vine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 15:1 the Lord says, "I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This true vine, which is the Son, with its branches, which are the believers in the Son, is the organism of the Triune God in God's economy to grow with His riches and express His life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ Himself is the true vine, and the Father is the Husbandman, the Farmer who cultivates the soil so that the vine may spread.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Lord's recovery we have seen the spreading of this vine to the uttermost parts of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, when I visited Germany in 1958 and stayed in Hamburg, I did not meet a single Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But now, twenty-five years later, there are a number of churches in Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What a spreading of the vine has taken place in Germany!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The vine in chapter fifteen is a sign of Christ's universal spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The abode, the dwelling, is a sign of the mingling of the Triune God with His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the vine tree is a sign of universal spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is foolish for politicians and statesmen to think that Christians can be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who persecute the believers in Christ do not realize that the more the believers are terminated, the more the Christians, all of whom are branches in the vine, will carry out the universal spreading of the true vine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have pointed out that the true vine is the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Son Himself is the vine, the Father is the Husbandman, and the Spirit is the Testifier.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the very chapter that reveals the universal vine, we have a word concerning the Spirit as the Testifier: "But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me" v. 26 . Therefore, in John 15 the vine is growing, the Husbandman is cultivating, and the Spirit is testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In relation to the true vine, the organism of the Triune God, what does it mean that the Spirit is the Testifier?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Doctrinally we may not be able to understand this, but experientially we do know what it means for the Spirit to be the Testifier.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we see the spreading of the vine, the Spirit within us says, "Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That's it!"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many have testified that the Spirit within them responded in such a way when they first came in contact with the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the Spirit's testifying within us concerning the spreading of the true vine.</S>
