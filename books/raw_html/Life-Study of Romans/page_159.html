<h2 class="head1">SANCTIFICATION, TRANSFORMATION,<br />AND GLORIFICATION</h2><p>We have pointed out in some of the foregoing messages that the central concept of the book of Romans is not justification by faith, but that God is making sons out of sinners in order to form the Body to express Christ. God&rsquo;s goal is not justification; it is the Body. In the book of Romans there are sections on justification (3:21&mdash;5:11), sanctification (5:12&mdash;8:13), and glorification (8:14-39). There is also a section on transformation (12:1&mdash;15:13). Romans 8:30 says, &ldquo;And whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.&rdquo; In this verse Paul does not mention redemption or reconciliation. In chapters three, four, and five he does speak of propitiation, redemption, justification, and reconciliation. Propitiation is for redemption, redemption is for justification, and justification issues in reconciliation. The reason Paul does not mention propitiation, redemption, or reconciliation in 8:30 is that they are all included in justification. For this reason, there are not separate sections in this book for propitiation, redemption, nor reconciliation. All are covered in the section on justification. In the same principle, in 8:30 Paul does not mention sanctification or transformation because both are included in glorification.</p><p>In this verse Paul says that we have been predestinated and called by God. Before the foundation of the world, God, according to His divine foresight, marked us out. He predestinated us in eternity past. Then, in time, He called us. Thus, those whom He foreknew and predestinated, He called. When God called us, He justified us. Through God&rsquo;s justification, our problems with Him have been solved. This does not mean, however, that justification marks the end of God&rsquo;s dealing with us. After justification, we still need to be sanctified, transformed, and ultimately, glorified. Hence, sanctification and transformation are for glorification. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory. This proves that transformation is for glorification.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF GLORIFICATION</h2><p>Many Christians hold strictly an objective concept of glorification. According to them, one day those who have been saved and regenerated will suddenly be glorified. The glorification of the believers, they claim, will take place instantaneously at the coming of the Lord Jesus. Some portions of the Bible seem to indicate this. For example, Colossians 3:4 says that when Christ our life appears, we shall appear with Him in glory. However, 2 Corinthians 3:18 speaks of being transformed from glory to glory, that is, from one degree of glory to another. In 1 Corinthians 15:40 and 41 Paul speaks of different kinds, or degrees, of glory. In this chapter Paul also uses the example of a grain of seed that is &ldquo;not quickened, except it die&rdquo; (v. 36). Paul says, &ldquo;That which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). Take a carnation seed as an example. Before it is sown into the earth, the carnation seed has no glory. But after it is sown, it begins to grow out of the earth as a tender sprout. This is the initial stage of glory. As it grows and develops further, it passes into another stage of glory. Eventually a blossom appears. This is the full glory of the carnation seed. This glory does not appear instantaneously or suddenly. On the contrary, it is a matter of gradual growth from one stage of development to another. It is the same in principle with our glorification. Although our glorification may appear to be a sudden occurrence, it is actually the consummation of a process of gradual growth and development in life.</p><h2 class="head1">AN ORGANIC, METABOLIC CHANGE</h2><p>After we have been justified, we need to be sanctified. Sanctification is mainly related to transformation, which issues in glorification. To be sanctified is to be transformed not only in outward form, but also in inward nature. Transformation denotes an inward, organic, metabolic change.</p><p>Christ as the organic seed of divine life has been sown into us. Now this seed must develop within our being. We were born natural and common. God&rsquo;s concern is not to change us from bad to good, from impatient to patient, from full of hatred to loving. God cares only to make sons out of sinners by putting His Son as the seed into us. Hallelujah, the seed of sonship has been sown into our being! Although our being is natural, this seed will produce an organic and metabolic change within it. Whatever is changed in this way becomes sanctified.</p><p>Once again we may use tea as an illustration. Suppose you have a cup of plain water, water that has the natural taste, color, appearance, and essence. The water is natural, not because it is clean or dirty, but simply because it is water. The one who wants to make tea is not satisfied with plain water; rather, he wants tea-water. In order to change natural water into tea-water, tea leaves must be put into the water. Then the essence of the tea will work within the water to &ldquo;tea-ify&rdquo; it. Through this process of &ldquo;tea-ification&rdquo; the water will eventually have the appearance and taste of tea. In fact, after the water has been permeated with the essence of tea, it will no longer be called water; it will be called tea.</p><p>We are the cup of plain, natural water. Whether we are clean or unclean, pure or impure, we are natural because we are &ldquo;water.&rdquo; But God has put Christ, the heavenly &ldquo;tea,&rdquo; into us, and the organic element of this &ldquo;tea&rdquo; is causing a metabolic change in our natural life. Day by day Christ is transforming us with His essence.</p>
