   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH OUR DISPOSITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE SAKE OF FRUITFULNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our disposition is the cause for our not bearing fruit and using our talent to care for people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are still too natural.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some persons are always slow, regardless of the situation they are in or the persons they are with.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is as if they would not even pour water on a house fire before they carefully checked what kind of water they should use.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of person will try to justify himself from the Bible, claiming that God is always patient and never does anything in a hurry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Watchman Nee pointed out to us how the Lord once ran to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the prodigal son returned home, the father ran to meet him Luke 15:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord may be patient in every other matter, but He is quick to receive sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some, though are too quick.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They bear fruit quickly, but then because they offend the fruit with their quickness, eventually they have no remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not care to rebuke or expose anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We simply must go to the Lord and let Him shine on us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we will see how natural we are.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By His mercy, we must have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are slow, we should speed up, and if we are quick, we should slow down.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Twenty years ago I gave a training on thirty points of character.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Character is different from disposition; it is thirty percent disposition by birth and seventy percent habit by our living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to be useful in the Lord s hand for fruit-bearing, we must deal with our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In my ministry I have seen many kinds of disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some people are peculiar in their way of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They can make people laugh, but it is difficult for them to minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These dear ones need to be dealt with in their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some of the dear saints are too loose and light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are never accurate in speaking or in doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is also according to their natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more our disposition is touched, the more useful we are in the ministry of speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some were born with a disposition for speaking, but they are not genuinely useful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to speak for the Lord, we must be reconstituted in our being, that is, changed in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times I have gone to the Lord and condemned myself, saying, Lord, I exercise my old, natural, dispositional way in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of this, the Lord has had the ground to change my way of speaking over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First Timothy 3:1 says, If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work, but to be an overseer requires that our disposition be dealt with in many directions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, we are not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot be too slow or too quick, too strong or too soft.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When there is the need to be strong, we must be strong, and when there is the need to be soft, we must be soft.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Different situations require our disposition to be adjusted in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>An elder must truly be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A good elder can speak a strong word of adjustment to a brother and then speak with him in a very pleasant way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, this is not to play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even a small child knows whether or not someone is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If someone loves a child genuinely, he knows it, but if that love is not genuine, he knows this also.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>People are able to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we must not play politics; we must be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The only way to be able to adjust a brother and then be pleasant with him is by having our disposition dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The best way to be dealt with is to hate our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our disposition is the depth of our self, which must be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are not useful in the Lord s hand for taking care of people, it is due to our raw, natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is easier to deal with our disposition when we are young.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brother Nee once told us that by the time someone is fifty years old, it is difficult for his disposition and natural life to be touched by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must not wait until we are too old to have our disposition dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The earlier we deal with it, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Dealing with outward wrongdoings is not as important as this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The most important thing that must be dealt with in our life with the Lord is our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must learn to have our disposition dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we pay adequate attention to the Lord and pray much about this, it will be easy for us to care for others, bear fruit, and make a profit by using our talent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then our entire situation will be radically changed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>FRUIT BEING THE OVERFLOW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many in today s Christianity teach that the reason we do not bear fruit is that we are short of power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They say we should pray and fast for a certain number of days until the power comes as the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I observed this kind of practice for many years, but I still did not see much remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For the branches of the vine tree to bear remaining fruit is not a matter of this kind of revival; it is a matter of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When branches receive a sufficient supply of life-juice, they bear fruit as the overflow of the inner life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This, not revival, is what the Lord needs.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the Gospel of John there is no hint of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rather, what is revealed in this book is the genuine, growing life out of which comes fruit as the overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Fruit is the overflow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we do not bear fruit, it is because we do not have the overflow of life; we are short and undersupplied by the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For many years the Lord has restrained us from emphasizing revival.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even when we did have a revival, it was in a restricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What the Lord requires in His economy is the genuine growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then out of this growth, we have an overflow of life, which is fruit that remains.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brother Nee once told us that if every one-talented person in the church would use his talent, we will have a true remaining revival.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What the Lord needs is not the kind of revival that comes and goes but the exercise of our talent with the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In order to have this, the basic condition is to deal with our disposition.</S>
