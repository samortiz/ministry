   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The believers are sanctified with Christ as the sanctifying life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Corinthians 1:30 reveals that Christ has been given to us from God as our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that the sanctifying life in us is the Christ who lives within us to sanctify us continually with His eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With Christ as the sanctifying life we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3 In the Word of God as the Truth Conveying the Reality of God the Father's Holiness the Attribute of the Holy Nature of God</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In John 17:17 the Lord Jesus says in His prayer to the Father, "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 19 the Lord goes on to say, "For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth."</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Father's word carries with it the Father's reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, His word is the reality, the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word, being the truth, works as reality in the believers to sanctify them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's living word works in the believers to separate them from anything worldly, separating them from the world and its occupation unto God and His purpose both positionally and dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what it means to be sanctified by the word of God as the truth, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This sanctification not Only changes our position but also our disposition, our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word of God as the truth conveys the reality of God the Father's holiness, which is an attribute of the holy nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Holiness is not God's nature directly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, holiness is an attribute of God's nature, which is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The holy nature of God is conveyed in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, God's word as the truth conveys the reality of God the Father's holiness because it conveys the holy nature of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we have the word as God's reality, this word sanctifies us subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This subjective sanctification is by the Spirit as the sanctifying power, with Christ as the sanctifying life, and in the word as the reality of God the Father's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word carries God's holy nature and imparts this nature into our being so that we may be sanctified subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>4 By the Father's Discipline That They Might Partake of His Holiness the Attribute of His Holy Nature</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To partake of the Father's holiness is to partake of the attribute of His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Father's disciplining us so that we might partake of His holiness is related to the Spirit's transformation work 2 Cor 3:18 , which is carried out through the divine dispensing inwardly and the environmental dealings outwardly.</S>
