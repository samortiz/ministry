   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Two Basic Requirements</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today, let me bring out two matters; both must exist before there can be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Testament clearly shows us two basic requirements: first, the authority of the Holy Spirit; and second, the boundary of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Authority of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must realize that where there is not the Holy Spirit, there is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is absolutely not Witness Lee, Chang Yu-zhi, or Yu Cheng-hwa; the church must only be the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, the church from beginning to end can only have one authority, one power, and one life, which is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is only one life of the Holy Spirit, only one power of the Holy Spirit, and only one authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, there are many elderly brothers here today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother Du may say, "Since I have been in the church for twenty years, I may make a proposal or initiate something."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is something extra coming out as a frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Brother Du is expressed, the Holy Spirit is not here and the church is not here as well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please remember that wherever the Holy Spirit is not, the church is not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is the place through which the Spirit of the Lord may express His desires without any hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the Lord used the body given to Him by Mary when He was on this earth, so He in the Holy Spirit uses the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church in its highest state is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, only that which is able to express the mind of the Holy Spirit can be called the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only the Holy Spirit Has Authority</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I will go on a little further by speaking first to the elderly brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>More or less we know what authority is, and we tell the younger brothers to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The basic question today is this: When we are obeying authority, whose authority do we obey?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let me say that just as the younger brothers become a disturbance when they speak according to themselves, the elderly ones also become a disturbance when they speak according to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The young ones who speak according to themselves are a disturbance, and the elderly ones who speak according to themselves are also a disturbance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the authority of the Holy Spirit is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why then do the younger brothers need to obey the elderly ones?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is because the elderly ones have learned more before God and know more of God's authority; consequently, the Holy Spirit can flow out more easily through them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are like a water pipe through which water has flowed for years without any blockage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The younger ones should obey the elderly ones, not because the elderly ones are the authority, but because it is easier for the Holy Spirit to speak through the elderly ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because they have worked for the Lord for many years, it is easier for the Holy Spirit to flow out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We learn to submit to the elder brothers because there is the authority of the Holy Spirit in them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once I do not obey, I easily lose the authority of the Holy Spirit in me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are not building up the authority of the elderly brothers, but the authority of the Holy Spirit which easily flows out from the elderly brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, the only authority in the church is that of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no authority that comes out from individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The elders do not have authority, the elderly brothers do not have authority, and the spiritual ones also do not have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only the Holy Spirit has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is called the Body of Christ.</S>
