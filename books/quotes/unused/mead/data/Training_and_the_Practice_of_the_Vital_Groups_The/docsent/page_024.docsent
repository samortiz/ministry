   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the preaching of the gospel, we need to get people convicted and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The ones who get saved should have the sensation and realization that they are sinful and need the Lord's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When an unbeliever prays with sincerity, "Oh, Lord, I am sinful," this means he is being touched by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way to be vitalized is to be stirred up in the first love for the Lord through repenting prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have a burden to help the saints become vital.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we need to be brought into the genuine practice of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to be vitalized, we need to be like the athletes who are in the Olympics.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we want to know what desperation is, we should consider these athletes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their dedication and endeavoring are a good display of desperation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Christian life is a life of martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul knew that he was going to be martyred 2 Tim 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus told us that anyone who would come after Him must deny himself and take up his cross to lose his soul-life Matt 16:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is much different from the "sugar-coated gospel" preached in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From my Christian experience I can say that the only real enjoyment for a Christian is not physical.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is absolutely spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Physically speaking, every step, every aspect, of the Christian life is a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Lord sent me to this country, I passed on many messages on the deeper truths, telling people how to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the beginning they were happy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Gradually and eventually, however, they lost their enjoyment mainly because they would not pay the high price.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord told the Laodiceans that they were lukewarm and that He was about to spew them out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then He told them that they had to pay the price to buy the gold, the white garments, and the eyesalve Rev 3:15-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Buying requires the paying of a price.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In today's Christianity where can you hear a message saying that you have to buy?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Dear saints, if we are going to be vitalized, we do have to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you would analyze your start of the vital group, I believe you would be convinced that you have not started yet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may have never had a genuine repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A genuine repentance means that you are under a kind of constant condemnation to such an extent that you realize you are nothing but a constitution of sin, transgressions, trespasses, mistakes, wrongdoings, and offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When you make a thorough confession, you will realize that you are a constitution of the flesh, the old man, the natural man, the world, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You will find out that the more you confess, the more you have to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It will seem that the dirt can never be cleared away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A thorough confession may take two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do not have such a repentance and confession with tears, how can your companion be led into being vitalized?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must have a genuine start of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Dear saints, have you ever made a thorough confession before God?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just to go to the Lord for five minutes to tell Him, "Lord, I am sinful; I repent," might be a kind of repentance, but that is not a thorough repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Psalm 51 is a psalm of David's repentance and confession of his indulging sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was rebuked by Nathan the prophet for what he had done, and he made his confession.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By reading that psalm you can see that his repentance and confession actually have no end. You should not believe that Psalm 51 has finished, or completed, David's repentance and confession.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The real confession, the real repentance, according to my experience, has no ending.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are a heap of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our constitution is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How then could we finish our confession?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may confess our sins and then be mean to someone right after our confession.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How could we be holy?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How could we be righteous?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But when we repent and confess the more thoroughly the better we receive mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not think that we can finish our confession.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The whole Christian life, on the negative side, is a life of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every day and every moment we have to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever we open up our mouth to pray, we should not say a word before confessing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After our confession, we are still sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because we are living in a dirty world, medical doctors tell us that we should wash our hands frequently to avoid getting sick.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the same way, we need to confess frequently day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to have such a thorough repentance and confession.</S>
