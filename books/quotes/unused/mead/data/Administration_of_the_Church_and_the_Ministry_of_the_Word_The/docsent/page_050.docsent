   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SERVICE IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>NEEDING TO HAVE A LIVING COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must fellowship, through prayer and consideration, with those whom we serve concerning the content of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was serving in northern China, between 1940 and 1943, there was a brother whose situation was in my constant consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes I received a burden while I was speaking from the podium, and I would say that this brother needed to be visited.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The brothers and sisters who heard this received a burden and visited him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Presently, however, because all the brothers endeavor to be unique in their speaking in order to become famous, they are not concerned about receiving a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This cannot be considered service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is regretful that the brothers in northern China did not leave the mainland.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The messages they gave met the practical need and were not compiled hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When saints returned from visiting the brothers and sisters, they gave a report of their visit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On Monday mornings we would fellowship concerning the condition of the brothers and sisters from eight in the morning until three in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes we would even fast and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result we learned many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We studied how to help those who were having problems and how to deal with the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Often after a person was visited, he became living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our speaking and our visitation worked together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But this working together was not by discussion; it was in spontaneity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is true and practical coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The speaking from the podium was living, and those who came to the meetings were also living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many of the saints were amazed that what was released in the message met their exact need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever they came to a meeting, their problem was solved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The speaking touched their problem and their inner being; hence, their problem was solved, and their need was met.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What was spoken was the living word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the situation for almost two years, because the serving ones looked for a living word, rather than a routine speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were not disorganized or loose, nor did they speak at will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, wherever they went, their leading in the churches was living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The best period of our coordination in the ministry of the word was between 1940 and 1943.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our present situation does not match the situation we had then.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During that time the coordination between those serving and those ministering the word was living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Printing was not as convenient as it is today, and there were not that many arrangements, but everything was living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In brief, we cannot be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should learn to depend on others, relying on them for our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should learn to coordinate with others in service.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not use dead ordinances or speak dead messages.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we should study a living way and learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, we should receive a burden and understand people s needs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should know the different problems of the saints, the problems of the children, the young people, and the elderly ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Based upon this knowledge, we can touch the elderly, the young people, and the parents when we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone who hears the message will be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church needs such a living word to bring in a living situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we encounter death in all our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The children s meeting, the young people s meeting, and the Lord s Day meeting are all conducted according to dead ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These meetings are our responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We cannot continue like this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord s work and the church are suffering a great loss, and the main responsibility is with those who minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The supply in the ministry of the word is important to the children, the young people, the parents, the elderly, and the working saints.</S>
