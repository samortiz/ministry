<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob<br>Building an Altar for the Offerings to Jehovah<br>and Living in a Tent as Pilgrims</H2><P>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob built an altar for the offerings (typifying Christ) to Jehovah and lived in a tent as pilgrims, looking forward to the consummation of the divine economy (Gen. 12:7-8; 26:25; 33:18-20; Heb. 11:9). They built an altar to offer what God wanted&#151;the offerings as types of Christ. Their erecting a tent indicates that they never became settled on earth but instead were a traveling people, strangers to the earth. They looked forward to the New Jerusalem, a city with foundations, the consummation of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Satanic Chaos with Abraham and Jacob</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Abraham Marrying Hagar</H2><P>Abraham married Hagar (Gen. 16:1-5). This issued in the negative story of Hagar and her son Ishmael (Gen. 21:8-10). Ishmael was cast out by God, and Hagar was set aside, for she was a concubine and not a proper wife.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jacob with His Entire Family<br>Going Down to Egypt</H2><P>Jacob with his entire family went down to Egypt. This resulted in the enslavement and tyranny of Egypt over the race of Israel (Exo. 1:8-14). The blessing is not with going down to Egypt (the world) but with going out of Egypt and going on and on until we reach the consummation of God's economy&#151;the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Divine Economy<br>with the People of Israel</H2><P>With the people of Israel&#151;a new race of mankind raised up by God&#151;we once again see the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The People of Israel<br>Passing through God's Judgment<br>and Making an Exodus from Egypt</H2><P>In the divine economy the people of Israel passed through God's judgment and made an exodus from Egypt (Exo. 12:1-14; 13:7&#151;14:31). First, God rendered them His redemption. By means of the Passover with the killing of the lamb and the striking of the blood, they passed through God's judgment. That was God's redemption. However, because they were still in Egypt, God exercised His salvation to deliver them out of the tyranny of Egypt. Thus, the children of Israel enjoyed two things&#151;God's redemption and God's salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Providing the People of Israel<br>in the Wilderness with Manna from Heaven<br>and Water out of the Moving Rock</H2><P>After the people of Israel passed through God's judgment and made their exodus from Egypt, they became a people traveling in the wilderness. As Exodus 16:1&#151;17:7 and 1 Corinthians 10:3 and 4 reveal, there in the wilderness God provided the people of Israel with manna from heaven (typifying Christ) and water (typifying the Spirit) out of the moving rock (typifying Christ). Only when they were outside of Egypt could they enjoy such provisions. This indicates that if we today are those who migrate, those who travel with the Lord, we will enjoy the blessing of His provision.</P>
