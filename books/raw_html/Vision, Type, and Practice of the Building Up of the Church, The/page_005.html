        <h2 class="head1">OUR SERVICE NEEDING<br />
TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>A person who does not have the consciousness of building may do the same work as a person who is controlled by a vision of the building, but the results of their work will be very different. Perhaps some would say, &ldquo;When we save a soul and gain one more stone by preaching the gospel, are we not doing the work of building? When we give a message of edification that causes those who were formerly cold to become zealous and those who were spiritually sick to be recovered as useful material, are we not doing the work of building? We might not declare it, but we are building.&rdquo; I would like to point out that without a consciousness of the building, our work will not issue in the building. If we have the vision of the building, the light of this vision will govern us. Wherever we go, this light will shine and control our walk and our work. As a result, the building of God will be brought in.</p>
<p>We should never think that the building is an insignificant matter. Those who do not know the building may preach the gospel with zeal, consecrate themselves to live for the Lord, and learn to live a spiritual life, but they will not be built up. Such ones do not sense the importance of being built up, nor do they regard the building as something important. As such, they cannot produce the building that God desires. A person will always consider his experience as being important. A person who has experienced salvation will consider salvation to be important. A person who has consecrated himself to live for the Lord will consider a consecrated living to be important. A person who has learned spiritual lessons and lives in the spirit will consider spirituality to be important. Likewise, a person who has been built up will consider being built up to be important. We must have a realization of the building, and we must also be genuinely built up. Then our work will not merely lead people to salvation, to love the Lord, or to live for the Lord, nor will we merely lead them to learn to be spiritual and live before God.</p>
<p>This can be likened to building a house. Building a house requires many workers involved with different tasks. Even though every person may have a different task, they share the same goal and know that their various tasks are all to build the house. It is not sufficient to cut the wood properly or to gather materials; the house needs to be built. Do we have such an understanding of the building in our service? Is our service controlled by the building? This is a serious matter.</p>
<p>If we are controlled by the building, our spiritual experiences and our service will be different. If we see the need for the building, it will be easy for us to be subdued and to receive the breaking of the cross. For example, it is helpful to exhort two responsible brothers who are not in harmony to learn the lesson of bearing one another, of being broken, and of dealing with the self. However, if these two brothers see the vision of God&rsquo;s building and see that their discord opposes and destroys God&rsquo;s plan, they will be subdued. They will be broken without someone speaking to them about being broken. They will be put to death by the cross without someone speaking to them about the killing of the cross, and they will bear one another. Instead of destroying the building, they will be subdued&mdash;in spite of their opinions, personal views, and inability to coordinate with others&mdash;when they see that what God wants to do today is the building.</p>
<p>We are not contending about the use of a certain expression, nor are we insisting on a certain matter. Our burden is that we all need to know and see this crucial vision. The vision of the building must shine continually on us like a great light. This vision must also restrict us so that we would always take the building as our goal in whatever we do. Our service does not matter, nor does the responsibility that we bear in the church matter. Whether we speak a few words in the meeting or visit the saints in their homes, our goal is the same&mdash;God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING AND BLESSING</h2>
<p>We need to be controlled by the building and to experience the benefits of being built up. Only those who have experienced the building up will have a zeal that lasts. Those who are not willing to be built up will become cold or backslidden, even if they were initially zealous. Those who are individualistic will eventually become cold and indifferent, even if they were full of love in the beginning. A person who is built up has everything; he not only has love and power but also the presence of God. Hence, it does not matter whether the church in a certain place has brothers who can give messages. The bringing in of God&rsquo;s blessing does not depend on having brothers who can give messages but on the saints being built up together. Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s dwelling place depends on our being built up together. God cannot dwell in us if we are not built up together. But once we are built up together, He will come and dwell in us. When He dwells in us, we will lack nothing.</p>
<p>Some of the district meetings in the church in Taipei are very good. These districts do not have brothers who can give messages, but the number of saints in the meetings has increased. These districts have increased because there is coordination in harmony and in oneness and because there is an atmosphere of loving one another. In other words, there is building up. This proves that as long as we have the building up, we will have God&rsquo;s blessing. If we would be built up, the number in every district would double after a year. Once we are built up together, the blessing will come.</p>
<p>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father, &ldquo;That they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me&rdquo; (v. 23). People in the world will know the Lord and believe in Him when they see the believers built up into one. On the day of Pentecost there were about one hundred and twenty of the Lord&rsquo;s disciples who came together as one man (Acts 1:14-15). Therefore, when they spoke, people were pricked in their hearts and repented (2:37). This repentance was the result of the power of Christ and the reality of the church being with the disciples.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the saints in a church or a district meeting may be filled with opinions, murmuring, and criticism, even if they do not utter anything out loud. For example, a brother may purse his lips while listening to a message, or he might shake his head while a sister is praying and then utter a prayer in subtle opposition after her. In such situations that lack building up, people cannot be saved. The gospel preached in such a situation will not be effective. However, if the saints are built up, there will be a different outcome. We may stutter when we preach the gospel, but people will sense a power that constrains them to repent. This is a wonderful situation.</p>
<p>I must solemnly testify that the blessing among us was brought in because of the harmony among the saints. It is wrong to think that the blessing among us was brought in by those who give good messages. Even if the brothers can give the best messages, there will not be any blessing if they are always in discord. It is also wrong to think that the blessing among us was brought in because the brothers are capable of administrating the church. Rather, the blessing was brought in through the harmonious coordination among the brothers. If there would be more harmony and more building up among the brothers in all places, the number of saved ones would increase, and the saints would receive more help. These blessings are the result of having God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>After the Israelites worshipped the golden calf in the wilderness, Jehovah said to Moses, &ldquo;Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst&rdquo; (Exo. 33:3). However, Moses said, &ldquo;If Your presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here. For how then shall it be known that I have found favor in Your sight, I and Your people? Is it not by Your going with us, so that we, I and Your people, are distinct from all the other people who are on the face of the earth?&rdquo; (vv. 15-16). Moses seemed to be saying that God had to be with them and to go with them no matter the circumstance and that they would not go up unless He went with them. Therefore, what matters among God&rsquo;s children is His presence, not how right or good something may be. If the Lord&rsquo;s presence is with us, everything will be good. His presence is a real test. Having His presence proves that the Spirit has built us together into God&rsquo;s dwelling place. God&rsquo;s presence is in the building. This is a great blessing, and we serve in the church in order to obtain this blessing.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
