<p>I have often noticed that I receive more light from the Bible when I am giving a message. Therefore, the younger co-workers should not think that they can receive more light in their personal study time. Suppose a co-worker who is preparing for a message is asked to visit a brother. If the co-worker refuses and says, &ldquo;I need to give a message tomorrow, so I cannot go,&rdquo; he will be closed to the needs of the saints. Even if he is able to give the message, it will be a dead message, lacking God&rsquo;s blessing. Even though the co-worker needs to prepare for the message, there are saints who need visiting. If he has a burden for the building up of God&rsquo;s house, he would care for the needs of the saints instead of his preparation. Perhaps he will not know what to speak about on the podium, but that message will be living and full of God&rsquo;s presence. There might not be anything high or profound in the message, but that message will touch the saints and open them. The saints will be encouraged to attend the meetings regularly, their problems will disappear, and they will gain understanding. This is the result of having God&rsquo;s blessing in our speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Prayers Being Answered</h2>
<p>The same principle applies to prayer. Sometimes we should leave the work and spend time with God in a quiet place. Even the Lord Jesus often set everything aside when He was on earth to spend time privately in prayer to God (Luke 6:12; Matt. 14:23). However, we cannot ignore the saints who have needs in order to focus on prayer for our personal spirituality. If the children of God express their need and request our ministering and help, we cannot ignore them. We must care whether they are stumbled or backslidden. Otherwise, our prayer will not be effective, heaven will be closed to us, and our fellowship with God will be interrupted. Even an hour spent in prayer would be a waste of time.</p>
<p>If, instead of caring for our personal prayer, we would care for the needs of the saints, the Holy Spirit would answer our prayers before we pray. In other words, because we care for the house of God, we will bring in much even though we have sown little, we will be satisfied even though we eat little, we will be warm with little clothing, and the little we earn will not be wasted. This is the blessing of God.</p>
<p>If we take care of God&rsquo;s house, heaven will be open to us. If, however, we care for our personal needs instead of caring for God&rsquo;s house and build paneled houses for ourselves while His house lies waste, then we will sow much but bring in little (Hag. 1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Missing the Blessing</h2>
<p>God will not bless a work that is apart from the building up of the church, even if the work is with the young people or the local saints. God only blesses the one work of building up the church, His house. Suppose the serving ones who work with the young people do not care for the matters in the church, that is, whether the young people are in the Lord&rsquo;s Day ministry meeting or in the table meeting. If the serving ones are more interested in having a lively and presentable young people&rsquo;s meeting with many in attendance, they are pursuing the young people&rsquo;s work while God&rsquo;s house lies waste. As a result, they will sow much but bring in little. The few souls who are gained will quickly fall away.</p>
<p>Likewise, if the serving ones involved in the work among the Taiwanese saints care only for a strong Taiwanese-speaking meeting without any regard for the other districts, these serving ones are pursuing the work with the Taiwanese saints while God&rsquo;s house lies waste. As a result, they will miss God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>If the responsible brothers care only for their own districts but do not regard the church, their service will not be blessed by God. Eventually, such ones will have the weakest districts. However, if a responsible brother is concerned for the other districts and bears the church on his heart, his district will become strong, and his service will be blessed.</p>
<p>Of course, a responsible brother should consider his district, but this is not a simple matter. If he does not care for the entire church, his considerations will not have God&rsquo;s blessings. If he cares for his district and for the entire church, he will have God&rsquo;s blessings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE HOUSE OF GOD<br />
BEING A PRINCIPLE</h2>
<p>John 2:17 says that the Lord was devoured by the zeal of God&rsquo;s house. In 2 Corinthians 11:28 the apostle Paul says that besides the outward problems, the crowd of cares that pressed upon him daily was an anxious concern for all the churches. These are positive statements concerning God&rsquo;s house. The Bible, however, also contains negative statements concerning destroying the house of God. In 1 Corinthians 3:17 Paul says that God will destroy persons who destroy the temple of God. It is possible that a person who seeks to do well in his own work but does not care whether the church can be built up is destroying the house of God. If this is true, God will destroy, not bless, such a work. This is very serious. This principle can be applied to our overall situation and to the details of our work. It can be applied in a general sense and in a narrow sense.</p>
<p>This principle can also be applied to material things. If we hope that God will give us material blessings to enjoy but do not care for the church of God, His house, we may not gain what we desire. On the contrary, when we give materially to the house of God more than to our own houses, we will discover that God cares for us. If, instead of caring for the house of God and the building up of the church, we focus on our personal joy and peace, we will have a miserable ending. If we set aside our own joy and peace to care for the house of God, we will eventually be full of joy and peace. Every blessing is God Himself. We have no good beyond God, and God is the portion of our cup (Psa. 16:2, 5). If we can learn to be devoured by the zeal of God&rsquo;s house and have an anxious concern for all the churches, we will be blessed people. We will also grow and have joy, peace, light, and be empowered. We will also have God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>We should pour ourselves out for the building up of the house of God until our whole being is exhausted. We must desire to be built up, and we must also build up the saints. We must be willing to consecrate ourselves to the Lord because we have learned the lessons. We must be willing to visit the saints, fellowship with them, and help them to walk on the way of the Lord, because we have been dealt with by Him. Then we can help the saints to consecrate themselves, we can help them to deal with sin, and we can help them to deal with the world. We can help them to be stripped, restricted, pressed, and ruled by God under His hand because this is our experience. By serving in this way we will experience growth, victory, joy, peace, and light, and the Bible will be opened to us. It may seem as though we do not work much, but the result of our labor will be rich and full of blessings. It may seem that we have gained little, but we will accumulate much.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM SELFISHNESS<br />
TO CARE FOR THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2>
<p>We must not focus on anything other than the work of God to build His house in the universe. Although we work with the young people, our goal is the building up of the house of God, not the young people. Although we work with the Taiwanese saints, our eyes are set on the building up of the church, not on the work among the Taiwanese saints. Although we lead the districts, our eyes are set on the building up of the church, not on the districts. We should not do anything that will mar or damage the building up of the church. We must be in fear, lest we sin against God and destroy His temple (1 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p>We need to learn this lesson thoroughly. We must be delivered from material things, our living, spirituality, work, gifts, and service so that we would not pursue these things for ourselves. We must also be saved from the principle of selfishness so that we can take care of the building up of the house of God. We are joyful for anything that causes the church to be built up, and we reject whatever causes the church to suffer loss, even though it may be beneficial to our work. We only want the blessing from God. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would be devoured by a zeal for the house of God and so that we would be concerned for all the churches (John 2:17; 2 Cor. 11:28). May we also take heed to this warning so that we would not destroy the house of God (1 Cor. 3:17). May God bless His church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
