   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a Buddhist family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At one time I was a Buddhist monk.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the age of eight or nine I began to love chanting, and at the age of ten I began to listen to Buddhist sermons in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I knew that the world is evil, and I desired to reach Nirvana and to save all beings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was a monk for nine years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My brother was a businessman and had been a Christian for over ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His whole family believed in the Lord, and they sent me gospel literature many times, hoping that I would believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once an elderly believer spoke with me at length about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When he began to pray, his expression reminded me of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I felt that there is indeed a true God in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later my brother wrote me and told me that my father and family had all believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My mother was sick and no doctor could cure her, but through prayer she was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time I saw that Buddhism is a big mess.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was vomiting blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I began to ask God to heal me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A few days later my vomiting stopped, and I accepted the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After I was saved, I sought the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once while I was praying, I became acutely aware of my extraordinary sins and peculiar disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I wept bitterly for half an hour, after which I felt happy inside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One Buddhist teacher that I used to learn from came and visited me and demanded that I immediately answer whom I would choose, Christ or Buddha.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I told him that I wanted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After I was saved, I was like a madman for half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was intensely zealous, and I preached the gospel to whomever I met.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At one point I began to come under Satan's attacks and fell into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I argued with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He accused me regarding the many sins I committed as a youth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I dealt with my sins and placed them under the cleansing of the precious blood of the Lord one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My heart loves the Lord and I desire to go into the villages to preach the gospel and to suffer for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord said that I have to give up everything to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Formerly, I dared not say this, but now I do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once I was sick, but I did not take any medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God alone has been sustaining me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For seven or eight years I did not receive any financial support from my family or from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I taught in a village and supported myself this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 1941 I was introduced to Brother Nee through Brother Ji Yung-tung, and I was told that I could go to Shanghai to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have written a note of consecration and have handed over myself and my all to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I weep and repent often for the years that I have wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that my brother will grant me much light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT Purging Rawness</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Two or three months ago, while I was in a prayer meeting in the church in Shanghai, I met our brother for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the second time I have seen him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Shia has to learn to launch his spirit further into deeper depths in God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He has to learn to grow and be matured.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When a man first begins his pursuit in God, everything with him is raw and "uncooked."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Anything that is raw needs to be cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In our pursuit of the Lord, we have to drop what is raw.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before a person believes in the Lord, everything with him is raw.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even his righteousness and morality are raw.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His entire living is raw.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But after he has followed the Lord and learned some lessons for a while, the raw things drop off.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The deeper the cross works on a person, whomever he may be, the less raw he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God grants us sufferings and chastisements not only to afflict us but to remove our rawness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every time we go through trials, sufferings, or chastisements, we should reap some benefit not merely in our thoughts, feelings, or emotions; our spirit should be purified through these processes as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our brother's spirit is scarcely touched.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We only find the fruit of the mind and the emotion in him; we find very little fruit of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the basic problem.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every experience should purify a man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Two of the Lord's disciples asked Him to send fire to burn up the cities of Samaria, but the Lord told them that they did not know their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our brother's trouble is that he does not know his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many people can talk.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They are zealous, and they have pure motives, but they never know their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is not enough to have fruit in the emotion and to realize that the Lord is love.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Love comes from the emotion, while teaching comes from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the spirit needs frequent dealings before it can be purified.</S>
