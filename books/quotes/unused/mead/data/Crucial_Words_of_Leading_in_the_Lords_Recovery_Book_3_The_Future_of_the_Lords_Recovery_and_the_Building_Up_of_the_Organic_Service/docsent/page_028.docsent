   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE TREASURES IN THE LORD S RECOVERY SERVING IN THE CHURCH ARMY FOR TWO YEARS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the Lord s leading, we hope that all of the college students among us will give the first two years after their graduation to the Lord, just as the young men in Taiwan do for military service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the most precious time of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we give to the Lord, we receive from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The clever children in a family do not ask their parents for things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, they give things to their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When they give their parents one item, their parents give them three items in return.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only foolish children continually ask their parents for things without giving anything in return.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are touched by the Lord to give a material offering, we feel to give a certain amount, but after considering our offering, we often cut the amount in half.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then if we consider the amount again, we cut it in half once more.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we consider a third time whether or not we should give, we think that there is no need to give at all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we must realize that whenever we stop giving, the Lord s supply to us will stop also.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a child of God, I can testify that if we give to the Lord, He will definitely give to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Offering something to the Lord is always a good deal, because we will be blessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, if the young people give two years to the Lord, He will be able to do many things within them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The largest heretical group in America is the Mormons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though they are a heretical group, they are spreading quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All their believers, both male and female, must serve for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They voluntarily give these two years and even pay for their own expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From the time they are children, they are taught in school that they must serve for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their parents cooperate and prepare the children to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When it is the child s birthday, the parents give the child some money and tell him to put it in the bank to be used for his two years of service in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way they are prepared from a young age to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After they graduate from college, they use their savings for their military service to their group.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>ACTIVELY GAINING PEOPLE BY PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the Mormons can gain people for the sake of their religion, should we not do something even higher for the Lord s recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the church in Taipei there are five to six thousand people who are practically in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How should we use these six thousand people?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Should they simply come week after week to meeting after meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have so much land, but there is no one to till the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Who should go to till the ground, and who will plant?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many brothers and sisters are willing to enter into the burden of the ministry and to go present the truth to others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You will discover that when you present the truth, you learn more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a person does not teach, he will not know how much education he lacks.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps you are a university graduate with a mathematics degree, but when you begin to teach, you will discover that your knowledge of mathematics is insufficient and that you need some reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if you have reference books, you need to study them and learn teaching methods.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, if we do not present the truth to people, we will not know how short we are in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As soon as we go out to preach the truth, we will immediately realize how short we are and how much we need to continue learning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we love the Lord, the church, and the Lord s recovery, we cannot continue to be satisfied with only six thousand saints in the meetings for five years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we truly love the Lord, we will have five thousand saints one year, eight thousand the next year, and thirteen thousand saints the following year.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we have fifteen thousand saints now, we should have a multifold increase in seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the Bible, wheat bears at least a thirtyfold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the word of the Lord Jesus, and it is His minimum requirement of us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, if we have fifteen thousand saints, after seven years we should be able to multiply thirtyfold.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should have four hundred and fifty thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Recently, a brother s wife was sick and went to a hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The brother discovered that there are more than one hundred brothers and sisters working as doctors and nurses in that hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That hospital can be compared to a piece of land.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some farmers should have gone there long ago to work the land.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we only recently found out that more than one hundred brothers and sisters work there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the Catholic Church were in a similar situation, they would have immediately sent a priest and two nuns to take care of that hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the Lord s Day they would hold mass in the hospital, and the priest would take the bread from the mass to every Catholic in the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the patient in the bed next to a Catholic asks what is happening, the Catholic would answer that his priest is bringing him the mass.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This would touch the other patients, and they would want to join the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why the Catholic Church can gain a million new members every year without holding evangelistic meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We, however, are like those who go fishing with no bait on the hook.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moreover, our hooks are straight, so it is no wonder that we do not have much increase.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It would be worthwhile to have two co-workers, preferably one brother and one sister, help the saints who are working in the hospital to grow in life and also to care for the patients by preaching the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this way many people will be brought in. If we did things according to this principle, we would need more than five hundred full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order to go to the many hospitals and the hundreds of schools to properly preach the gospel, we must equip ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must at least spend the time to finish reading the Life-study of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, this is only a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must study our publications also.</S>
