   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE MIXED EXPRESSIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE PSALMIST'S SENTIMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN HIS ENJOYMENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN GOD'S HOUSE 3 Scripture Reading: Psa 31 33</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we come to the Psalms with a clear view concerning the entire Bible with its principles, we can realize that the book of Psalms bears two burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It takes care of two responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, it shows us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, it shows us Christ in comparison with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Beginning in the book of Genesis, Christ is revealed as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One Bible teacher has said that the tree of life is over today, but the tree of life in Genesis 2 is a central item.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the tree of life is taken away from Genesis 2, Genesis 2 means nothing and becomes nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is wrong to say that the tree of life is over today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Revelation 2:7 the Lord Jesus said that to the overcomer He would give to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus came to feed us with Himself as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first responsibility the written word of God bears is to show us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's desire in eternity past was not concerning the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The law came in at Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Mount Sinai is mentioned by Paul in Galatians 4, not in a positive sense but in a negative sense vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the eyes of both God and the apostle Paul, Mount Sinai is a very negative term.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sinai produces slaves, and is signified by a concubine, Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The proper wife was Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The concubine was Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever comes out of this concubine is a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the Jews who treasure, uplift, and try to obey the law are slaves under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Besides Mount Sinai there is another mount, Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hebrews 12 says that in the New Testament we have come, not to Mount Sinai but to Mount Zion v. 22 . Here we are not slaves, but we are sons of the free woman.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That means we are sons of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The grace of God is signified by the free woman, Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law is signified by a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not for the law, but as the sons of the free woman, we are exalting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first responsibility of the Psalms is to show us Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second responsibility of the Psalms is to give us a comparison between Christ and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In message eight we saw the lines, the principles, and the spirit of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Bible God shows us only two lines.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One is the proper line and the other is the negative line.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The proper line is of Christ from God, and the negative line is of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why there are two trees in Genesis 2, and those two trees signify two sources.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The tree of life signifies God as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then out of these two sources there are two lines.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One line is the line of the day, and the other line is the line of the night.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The negative line of darkness is the line of satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The positive line of the day is the line of the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In addition to these two lines, there is also the line of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is the main line, and the law is a side line.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you do not handle the side line properly, the side line becomes a part of the negative line, which is the line of chaos, the line of death, the line of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since the day the law was given, God's people have very rarely handled the law properly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I believe that Moses knew something about the position of the law because when he became old he wrote Psalm 90.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In verse 1 he said, "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to Moses' realization, God is our dwelling place, and we are living in God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is absolutely not according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Psalms' second responsibility is to show us the difference between Christ and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, most of the readers of the Psalms do not understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They think that everything in the Psalms is positive.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we have seen that many expressions in the Psalms are according to the human concept of uplifting the law, not according to the divine concept of exalting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We saw in the previous message that it is difficult to find anything in Psalms 28 30 that is up to the divine standard of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this message we want to see the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in Psalms 31 33.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Much of David's speaking in these psalms is according to the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Regretfully, when most readers of the Bible come to the Psalms, they do not see much of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They may see the good points in the Psalms which are according to the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Psalms exhort and advise us to fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then they tell us to take refuge in God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As persons under all kinds of attack, we need a refuge, a place to hide.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can take refuge in our God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Psalms also speak of trusting in God, waiting on God, and hoping in God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then the Psalms speak of praising God, thanking God, and worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These are the points based upon which all the psalms are composed: to fear God, to take refuge in God, to trust in God, to wait on God, to hope in God, to praise God, to thank God, and to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These are the main points in many of the psalms, especially in Psalms 31 33.</S>
