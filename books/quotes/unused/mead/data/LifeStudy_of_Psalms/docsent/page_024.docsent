   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 7 says, "I will recount the decree of Jehovah;/He said to Me: You are My Son;/Today I have begotten You."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Today" is the day of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Acts 13:33 Paul quoted Psalm 2:7, telling us that this refers to Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His resurrection, Christ was begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since He was already the Son of God, why did He need to be begotten as the Son of God in resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ was the only begotten Son of God in His divinity John 3:16 , but when He became incarnated, He put humanity upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This humanity had nothing to do with the sonship of God, but through His death and resurrection, His humanity was "sonized" to also be the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By resurrection Christ brought His humanity into the divine sonship and was designated the Son of God with His humanity Rom 1:4 .</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the firstborn Son of God, and we are the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We believers in Christ are regenerated sons of God, having God's life and God's nature, but we also have our human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our human nature is still in the process of being begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have been regenerated in our spirit, but we still have not been transfigured in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When our body is transfigured, redeemed, glorified, our body will also be "sonized."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our sonship will be completed by that time Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sonship began with the regeneration of our spirit, is continuing with the transformation of our soul, and will be consummated with the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The process of our sonship passes through our regeneration and transformation to our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Psalm 2 we can see God's economy with God's kingdom and the resurrection of Christ, in which He was begotten to be God's firstborn Son.</S>
