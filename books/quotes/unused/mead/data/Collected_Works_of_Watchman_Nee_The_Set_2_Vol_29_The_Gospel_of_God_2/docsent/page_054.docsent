   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE CONTINUAL CLEANSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AFTER WE HAVE BELIEVED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The question now is this: What should we do if we sin again?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What should we do if we become filthy again?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the sins we committed before we were saved have been washed away by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But what should we do about the sins that are committed after we are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not want to be chastised.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not want to lose the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not want to suffer the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What can we do before God?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us consider 1 John 2:1: "My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Christian's goal is not to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John wrote these words so that we would not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the status that Christians possess, it is possible for us not to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Unfortunately, according to actual history, we often do sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Positionally speaking, we should not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But experientially speaking, we often do sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no need to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But sin is an unshakable fact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John continues, "If anyone sins."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we are dealing with the problem of a Christian who sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is a little one of God; he belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he sins, what should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does not say that we have an Advocate with God; rather, it says that we have an Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, this verse refers to the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It refers to those that have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If anyone among the saved ones, the children of God, sins, he has an Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not a dispute in a law court, but a matter within a family.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word Advocate in the original language is paracletos.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Para means alongside of.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be alongside of means that you are there and another is there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are in Shanghai, and this one is also in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you go to Canton, this one also goes to Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is like railway tracks.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You cannot have one track in Szechwan and another in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Cletos means helper.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A paracletos, therefore, is someone who is alongside helping.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You can run away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But wherever you run, the paracletos will be there also.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many who help are very good, but they sometimes come too late.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There may be a lot of rice in Shanghai, but the starving ones in Szechwan will not be able to get it, because it is not alongside.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Greeks used the word paracletos to refer to a defense lawyer in court.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose that you do not understand the law, and others accuse you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Others may sue you or take advantage of you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But you do not have a way to answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now there is a paracletos to answer for you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Others charge that you have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But your paracletos will say that you do not have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He will answer for you like a defense lawyer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The meaning here is to have someone next to you to speak for you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a Christian sins, there is One with the Father speaking for him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Satan will never stop his accusations against the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Revelation 12:10 tells us that he accuses the brothers day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Day and night we are the defendants and he is the accuser.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we have an Advocate, who is Jesus the Righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here it says that He is the Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here He is not the gracious One, but the righteous One.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why does it not say that He is the gracious One?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is because in the heavenly law court there is no talk of grace, in the same way that there is no talk of grace in earthly law courts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Any judge who wants to forgive others is an unrighteous judge.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only those who are for righteousness can be judges.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God is for righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He did not forgive our sins unrighteously.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He did not overlook our sins, gloss over our sins, or let us get by with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Rather, He judged our sins in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord Jesus does not defend us by saying that the temptation was too great and as little children we could not handle it, and that therefore God has to grant us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord Jesus does not say that Christians are too small and their knowledge is too little, that the flesh is too weak and the enticement of the world is too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He does not say that the wiles of Satan are too cunning and that there is no way to reject Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is not the way that the Lord Jesus makes our defense.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He does not plead for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Neither is He there as a dispenser of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>John says that Jesus Christ is the Righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He tells God that on account of Him and what He has done, God has to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>How does this Advocate make a defense for us?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are told in the next verse: "And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world" 1 John 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord Jesus makes His defense for us based on His accomplished work, that is, His propitiation on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As a result, we are able to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is a complete propitiatory sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It includes all the sins of all the Christians in time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When this propitiatory sacrifice is shown to God, God no longer has a reason to punish the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord's propitiatory sacrifice is not just for past sins, but for all present and future sins as well.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The verb in this verse is in the present tense, not in the past tense.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God cannot condemn us based on Satan's accusation, because Christ's redemptive work accomplished on the cross includes all the sins of today and all the sins that will be committed until the day of His return.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All our sins are included in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God must forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He cannot do otherwise, because this forgiveness has a foundation.</S>
