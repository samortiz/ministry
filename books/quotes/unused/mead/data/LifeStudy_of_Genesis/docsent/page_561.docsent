   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e Rich in Wine and Milk</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 11 says, "Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse is extremely difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible an ass, or donkey, signifies one who labors very hard, especially laboring in the matter of transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even the Lord Jesus rode upon an ass into the city of Jerusalem Matt 21:5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although an ass is usually used for labor in travel, in verse 11 the ass is not laboring; it is bound to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This signifies that labor was over, that the destination has been reached, and that the rest has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not think that the word "binding" in this verse is negative.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No, it is very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Any ass used for long journeys would certainly enjoy being bound to a vine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever a rider binds an ass to something, even to a stake, the ass will be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the poetic language of verse 11, the binding of the ass depicts rest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to this verse, even the donkey has stopped his work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ass here is not bound to a stake, but to a fruitful vine full of vegetation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we consider this picture, we shall see that it signifies that labor is over and that the harvest has come.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know that this verse refers to the harvest because it speaks of wine, the produce of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This implies the riches of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The latter part of verse 11 says, "He washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that there is an abundance of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The supply of wine is so bountiful that people not only drink it, but even wash their clothes in it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation 6:6, speaking of famine, says, "Do not harm the oil and the wine."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This warning indicates the scarceness of wine during famine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in Genesis 49:11 there is an abundance of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The words "the blood of grapes" refer to grape juice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Have you ever seen a country with such riches that its inhabitants even washed their clothes in grape juice?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although America is a rich land, it is not that rich.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What a picture we have in verse 11!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This picture shows that labor is over and that rest in the enjoyment of the riches has begun, even for the donkeys.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now is not the time for sowing the seed; it is the time of harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 11 is a poetic description of the millennium, the coming age of the thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In that age, labor will cease, and instead of labor, there will be rest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you still choose to labor, you should bind your ass.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not loose it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to Leviticus 23, on the day of the feast of Tabernacles, no one was permitted to work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Labor was prohibited because everything had been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All that remained was to enjoy the produce of the rich harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The feast of Tabernacles typifies the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During the millennium there will be no labor because all the labor will have been completed in the preceding dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The asses, the laboring ones, will be bound.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead of labor, there will be the rich enjoyment of an abundant harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There will be so much wine that we shall wash our clothes in it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 12 says, "His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Bible wine symbolizes the joy of God's salvation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first miracle the Lord Jesus performed was that of changing water into wine John 2:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This wine signifies not only redemption, but also the salvation of life and the salvation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we have the salvation of life, this salvation becomes the wine that constantly stirs us to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Along with the wine, we have milk.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Just as the source of the wine is the vineyards, the source of the milk is the sheepfolds spoken of in verse 14 Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Milk signifies the nourishment of life that satisfies us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When someone is dying of starvation, the area around his eyes becomes greenish grey.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But in this verse the eyes are not greenish grey; they are "red with wine."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, the teeth are "white with milk."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The calcium contained in milk produces healthy teeth with the proper color.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These figures regarding the eyes and the teeth indicate that, when the asses are bound and labor is over, the produce of the rich harvest will be more than sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It will be so adequate that people will even wash their clothes in wine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Eventually they will have eyes that are red with wine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Also, their teeth will be strong and white.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This rest and enjoyment depend on Christ as the fighting, resting, and producing lion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As such a lion, He has brought forth us, His baby lions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because the work has been accomplished, there is no need for us to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Instead, we should simply rest and enjoy the rich produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today we are enjoying the wine and the milk.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whenever people look at us, our eyes should be red and our teeth white.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is a picture of the church life today and of the millennium in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even in today's church life, all the asses should be bound.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Often the brothers and sisters bring a laboring ass with them to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This indicates that they are still laboring and journeying and that they have not yet come to their goal, their destination.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But all these asses must be bound.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because we have already entered into rest and have come to our destination, there should be no laboring or journeying.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have reached our destination, our goal, the place where we can enjoy the boundless supply of wine and milk.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do you still need a laboring donkey?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some of the older ones always have a donkey with them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It seems they are still journeying, still laboring.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After hearing one of my messages, they expect to labor and journey even more.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But verse 11 says that we must bind our ass to the rich vine.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This means that we must cease our laboring and our journeying.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today, in the church life, we are in the goal, the destination.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Here there is no labor, only rest and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I expect to see all the asses bound.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Instead of laboring, go home to wash your clothes in wine.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then come to the next meeting with red eyes and white teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Come full of milk, full of joy and nourishment.</S>
