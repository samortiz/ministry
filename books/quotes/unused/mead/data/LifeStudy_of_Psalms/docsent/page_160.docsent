   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRAISING THE KING IN HIS FAIRNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 2 the psalmist praises the King signifying Christ in His fairness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord Jesus comes to us, He comes first in the aspect of His fairness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why, when we preach the gospel, we need to preach mainly Christ's fairness, telling others how good and loving Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may say that this kind of gospel preaching is a "hook" with a tasty "bait."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus and loves Him has been "hooked" by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Blessed are they who have been hooked by Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As one who has been hooked by the Lord, I often say to Him, "Lord Jesus, You have caught me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have captured me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I had not been captured by You, I would be a different person living a different life."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now the One who has come to us in His fairness, the One who has caught us and who loves us, wants us to love Him in return.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to love Him and even become His love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the issue of Christ's showing us His fairness and of our enjoyment of Christ in His fairness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is impossible for us to speak in full concerning Christ's fairness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A. Fairer than the Sons of Men</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to verse 2a, as the King Christ is fairer than the sons of men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. Grace Being Poured upon His Lips</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 2b says, "Grace is poured upon Your lips."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that grace continually proceeds out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Concerning this, Luke 4:22 tells us that the people marveled at the words of grace proceeding out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>C. God Having Blessed Him Forever</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Psalm 45:2c the psalmist continues the praise of the King, saying, "Therefore God has blessed You forever."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the man Jesus is fair, sweet, and full of grace, God has been moved to bless Him forever.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, Romans 9:5 speaks of Christ as "God blessed forever."</S>
