As the Lord's recovery is continually spreading throughout the world, these messages are more than crucial and urgently needed
Our hope and expectation is that these messages will become a governing and controlling vision for all in the Lord's recovery
As the last item, we need to fellowship again concerning our attitude toward the denominations and the free groups
These two ministries are one, just as the Old Testament and the New Testament are one Bible with two parts or two sections
God does not have two Bibles; He has only one Bible with two sections, the Old Testament and the New Testament
In God's work to produce the old creation, the first creation, man had no share because he had not yet been created
His first creation resulted in physical materials but it was not God's intention merely to create the old things and stop there
In the first step, in the old creation, He did everything by Himself, but in the second step He can do nothing apart from man
The very conception of the Lord Jesus of the Holy Spirit, the conception of the incarnation, is itself a mingling
The Old Testament ministry was a preparation, a shadow, a prefigure, and the New Testament ministry is the fulfillment
In order to make this matter clear, we need to use these two different words, the ministry and the service, or the services
There was John the Baptist, then the Lord Jesus, then the twelve disciples, and then so many others from Acts to Revelation
Eventually the unique ministry of God is to carry out the ministry of Christ that the church might be brought into being
The apostles accomplished a service which occupies the great part and the main part of the New Testament ministry to accomplish Gods economy
Why is it that there were divisions even from the time while the apostles, including Paul and John, were still here on this earth?
Divisions began to take place from the last part of the first century and have continued to take place until the present century
As those in the Lord's recovery, we must ask ourselves what our realization is of the Lord's ministry to carry out His economy
If all the Christians today would be willing for the Lord to take away their different ministries, they would all be one
In the four Gospels Jesus Christ carried out God's ministry, and in the first part of Acts, Peter continued that ministry
In the second part of Acts, Paul's ministry was a continuation of Peter's to carry out God's New Testament ministry
In Antioch Paul was facing the number one apostle, Peter, and he was facing representatives of the most influential apostle, James
When some representatives came from James, Peter became a hypocrite and pretended that he had not eaten with the Gentiles
Not only was that a judgment on the rebellious Israel, but it was also the destruction of the base of Peter's work and of James' influence
In 1 Timothy 1:4 the word economy, or dispensation , is strongly used, and Paul charged Timothy to take care of God's economy
We need to realize that Satan could use any one of us to bring in some other kind of teaching that may be scriptural
Such teaching would have been different from the teaching concerning God's economy as it was presented by Paul
In Matthew 9 the disciples of John came to question the Lord Jesus, and they included the Pharisees along with themselves in their question
Before that time, the Pharisees were one sect, and there was another sect, a heretical sect, called the Sadducees
We need to realize that for John to be put into prison was sovereign of the Lord, and even for John to be beheaded was sovereign of the Lord
We must believe that God is sovereign, and we need to consider soberly why God allowed John to be imprisoned and later beheaded
The account of the shining of Moses' face in Exodus 34 does not tell us why Moses covered his face with a veil
According to Paul's interpretation in 2 Corinthians 3:13, Moses was afraid that the people would see the termination of his ministry
We all are happy to be used by the Lord in a certain service, but none of us would be willing to see that service come to an end
It was this kind of trouble that forced God, the sovereign One, to allow John to be imprisoned and even to have his life terminated
After John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus continued God's New Testament ministry, and He thoroughly accomplished that part of the ministry
On the day of Pentecost Peter used one of the two keys to open the gate for the Jewish people to enter into God's New Testament kingdom
When God was going on to use him with the second key to open the door for the Gentiles this contradicted Peter's background and tradition
Peter had the Spirit dwelling within him inwardly, but he could not understand the indwelling because of his background and his tradition
Peter had the outward outpouring of the Spirit and also the inward indwelling of the Spirit, but he could not understand the indwelling
Especially in the second one, he was very genuine and bold, because he recommended one who had rebuked him to his face
From what we have seen in the Life-studies of James and Mark, we can realize that even the situation in Acts 15 was not entirely pure
In other words, we could say that the weakness that was there in chapter fifteen was exposed in chapter twenty-one
In Acts 21 James was very bold to declare that there were tens of thousands of Jewish believers in Jerusalem zealous for the law
Some may argue that Paul was not weak, but that he was very strong to keep his word that to the Jews he became a Jew
It was very good for Paul to write the Epistles, such as Ephesians, Philippians, and the others written while he was imprisoned
Surely Barnabas was not a Judaizer, but because of his opinion, he took his way to carry out the so-called ministry
His ministry became a problem there, not because of Peter, but simply because there was such a thing as Peter's ministry
In Corinth, Peter's ministry and its following and Apollos's ministry and its following created a problem that almost caused a division
In any case, at Corinth there were problems due to these three kinds of service, that of Peter, of Apollos, and of Paul
We could not see in the Scriptures that Apollos was one hundred percent one with Paul in God's New Testament economy
The first meeting of the Lord's table in the Lord's recovery took place with Brother Nee and another brother and his wife
Eventually that brother became a problem to Brother Nee because he was not one with him in God's move at that time in China
If you are thoroughly one hundred percent one with me, we are like a roof that has no crack for the rain to come in
There was a reason for the problem in Corinth where some said, 'I am of Cephas,' 'I am of Apollos,' and 'I am of Paul'
Such a thing could happen there simply because the atmosphere, the flavor, the color, and the spirit among the three were not one
In the climate of the Lord's recovery today, there are some signs that some storms may come if we do not exercise our carefulness
In this universe we see these witnesses standing before the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration- Moses and Elijah
In addition, if we say that man could only die once, based on Hebrews 9:27, we need to account for the case of Lazarus
The major points concerning the two witnesses were covered in message twenty-seven of the Life-study of Revelation, pages 317 through 325
It is not at all a small thing to say a word or to do something to affect the Lord's recovery in a negative way
We are here, dear brothers, and we need to learn of the Lord concerning His economy, even as Paul said, with fear and trembling
From the four cases we have considered, you could see the hints concerning all the things that caused trouble in the Lord's move
That situation caused Paul to be embarrassed to the uttermost and, in a sense, to make a fool of himself in order to vindicate himself
It was not the opposers, the criticizers, who created the trouble and embarrassed Paul, but such dear ones as Apollos and Peter
It would take at least thirty messages to cover what is on my heart nevertheless within these few chapters we can touch some crucial points
Needless to say we should neither despise nor even neglect Johns ministry since it was a very solid initiation of the New Testament ministry
We need to consider these matters carefully in the light of the depth of the truth, not merely according to the letters in black and white
The ministry of John was a termination of the old creation, the old culture, the old religion, the old ordinances, and the old practices
The only One that could never be terminated and that never would need to be terminated was the Triune God Himself
When John stood up to minister, his ministry terminated whatever God had created, whatever had come into being
Our God is a God full of purpose; only one with no purpose would have terminated things for the sake of termination
While John was ministering to terminate everything, Jesus came into John's ministry, not to take over that ministry but to enter into it
The way Jesus entered into John's ministry was by accepting John's baptism; even He accepted the termination at that time
We need to have a deep realization within us that in His constitution there was the essence of the old creation
We need to take special note that John 1:14 does not say that this Word became a man, but rather says that this Word became flesh
Before the descending of the Spirit upon Him, He had already been conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the Holy Spirit
Right away He became One who was a mingling of divinity with the terminated humanity and anointed with the Holy Spirit
After the Holy Spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus, He was the qualified minister of the New Testament ministry
John was not a person conceived and born of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence mingled with the human essence
Not only John the Baptist but also his mother Elizabeth and then his father Zachariah experienced such a filling of the Holy Spirit
In that family the son took the lead, the mother followed, and the father concluded this filling of the Spirit
Jesus had something intrinsic that was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence mingled with the human essence
The four Gospels present His ministry to the readers, but many readers do not realize adequately what the four Gospels present
In these four Gospels that were selected out of so many we have a clear picture of the ministry of this unique One
You cannot find one adjective in any language which is adequate to describe the One presented in the four Gospels
It was Peter, John, and James who heard the gospel, who received the truth, and who were released from Satan's possession
After those ten days the Holy Spirit that descended upon Jesus after His baptism descended again upon those people, and they were anointed
In a proper sense, just as we may say that Peter became a reproduction of Jesus, we may also say that they became Jesus
If you consider this very Jesus who served God as a slave in such a ministry, what words could you use to describe this ministry?
In Luke 7 there is the case of the son of the widow in Nain who was dead and being carried in a coffin on the street
When He was dying there on the cross, in the eyes of God He was at least a fivefold person, a person in at least five aspects
We need to realize that it is not easy to study the Bible properly and to understand it properly and adequately
All the demons were busy, the evil angels were busy, and Satan was busy because it was not only Jesus that was crucified there on the cross
He carried our sin and our sins, Satan and his world, and the ordinances, including the human culture, to the cross
All the old things were terminated at the cross of the Lord Jesus, and all the new things were germinated in His resurrection
In this light concerning the New Testament ministry you could see where you should be, what you should be, and what you should do
It was based on this pressing need that the decision was made to call these meetings for urgent fellowship to present these messages to you
In these days we are very much in need of the Lord's mercy that we might see the very inner essence of the New Testament ministry
You may not realize how little you know, even how little has been wrought into you from the training we have had together
There are some among us who are off the track; whether you stay where you are or go to another place, you are off
Also, who can say that they do not do anything by their own will and that they do not do anything to seek their own glory?
That initial part of the ministry brought in the main section of the New Testament ministry, the ministry of Christ Himself
The Son came in the Father's name , the Son came with the Father , and the Son told us that the Father never left Him alone
We should be on guard concerning the inaccurate teaching of the so-called Trinity that stresses the matter of three separate persons
It is permissible to use the word distinct in reference to the three of the Trinity but it is altogether inaccurate to use the word separate
According to the principles of chemistry, once leaven has been put into fine flour and mingled with it, the fine flour cannot be purified
The truth of the Trinity has been leavened, but according to God Himself, one can never destroy or damage the truth
According to the basic principle, we all need to understand that the Son never did anything apart from the Father
We need to see that the divine title the Father the Son and the Spirit was revealed in a way that was for our experience not for doctrine
You may think it sounds quite strange to say that we cannot understand the Triune God, but we can experience Him
While we say that the Lord is the Father and that He is also the Spirit, we cannot annul the distinction between them
From the black and white in the pages of the Bible, you can tell that there is a distinction between the three
We cannot explain the fact that there is a distinction and there is the oneness, but we can experience the Trinity day by day
When the Son passed through His human death and entered into resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit, He did it with the Father
In resurrection the Son with the Father became the life-giving Spirit, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
They can be compared to five spices or five ingredients for the compounding of such an all-inclusive anointing
In the night of His resurrection He came back to His disciples not to teach them, not to carry out some work, but to breathe into them
It is very interesting that after this breathing in John 20 He did something further in the next chapter, in John 21
Even consider yourself-do you think you could remain together in oneness with one hundred twenty others to pray for ten days?
All the others became indignant because James and John wanted to be at the right hand and left hand of the King
In medical science, the greatest thing is to know how to inject all the necessary elements into the human body
It was because of such a life-giving injection that we can say Peter was another person in the first two chapters of Acts
There was nothing for their eyes to see, there was no outward attraction, and there was certainly no entertainment
The very element of Jesus had been injected into their being so they were the reproduction, the continuation, the increase of Jesus
Whatever had been there as an ingredient in Jesus in the four Gospels was injected into the one hundred twenty in Acts 1
They had been replaced with this wonderful Jesus through His death and resurrection, and they were, therefore, ready to be anointed
When the day of Pentecost came, the Spirit descended upon them economically just as the Spirit had descended upon Jesus after His baptism
When he said that God had raised up One out of the descendants of David, he was speaking concerning the incarnation
He had been crucified by those who were now listening to Peter, but God raised Him up, because death could not hold Him
From these points we can see that Peter's ministry was simply a continuation and a repetition of the ministry of Jesus
The reason we need to use parables and illustrations is that we are short of the resurrection life and short of the Spirit's power
In a pure way, without any distractions, Peter referred to the Old Testament, but he did not expound any part of it
We need to spend time to consider carefully those five messages of Peter to see what kind of ministry Peter was carrying out
Although the Bible says that Ananias had a good report of all the Jews there, it is strange that he is not mentioned any other time
We can see the indications of the problems not only with Paul and Barnabas, but even the more between Paul and Peter
No one can deny that Paul and Peter were co-workers, but there was, nevertheless, something not so smooth or sweet in their relationship
We need to consider, though, what it meant for Paul to receive a commission to go to the Gentile world to establish the Gentile churches
Now here was another one, a typical Jew, who received a commission to go into the Gentile world to establish Gentile churches
Eventually, trouble came to the Gentile churches from the source of the Judaizers who came to Antioch, the source of the Gentile churches
The very Paul who rebuked Peter strongly regarding the matter of law , tolerated the outcome of that conference in Jerusalem
Now you can see that there was a problem between the Gentile churches established by Paul and the Jewish churches established by Peter
James took the lead to tell Paul to look at the tens of thousands of Jewish believers, all zealous for the law
At that very time, four were there taking such a vow, but they were poor and unable to pay the price for the sacrifices, the offerings
In this way Paul was dragged into the old net, the very net that he himself had torn into pieces in Romans and Galatians
That net was still in existence in Jerusalem, and when he went there, it seemed that he entered into the net and was caught
It was as if the Lord told Paul that he may have tolerated that situation, but the Lord Himself would never tolerate it
Under that clear sky in the prison Paul wrote the Epistles to the Ephesians, to the Philippians, and to the Colossians
After his first imprisonment he wrote 1 Timothy and Hebrews, and during his second imprisonment he wrote 2 Timothy
Most Bible teachers recognize that these books are high deep and profound and that they touch the very heart of Gods New Testament economy
Rather, he would have urged James to cancel that vow, take those four brothers out from under the vow, and forget about the temple
Do you not know that the offerings of the cattle were in the old dispensation, and that was fulfilled by the Lord Jesus?
It was as if God said to forget about Jerusalem and about the tens of thousands of believers zealous for the law
The Lord cleared up the situation that was clouded by the mixture of the old things of Judaism with the New Testament economy
What was left after Jerusalem was destroyed were some deeper Epistles written by the apostle Paul under a clear sky
The cloud of mixture was blown away, and the apostle who tolerated too much was disciplined to be very clear concerning God's economy
Today's Christianity is altogether in a clouded situation even after God's stern dealings with the church of mixture in A
How we thank the Lord that these three things are facts in history, and we are inheriting these facts as our rich portion
With such a rich inheritance as our portion, we should no longer be in a situation that is clouded by the mixture of Judaism
It is only related to this wonderful person, to His life, and to His ministry to produce the believers as members to form the Body of Christ
Through the twenty centuries what has been put out has been one new thing after another, different from the teachings of others
There are some who think that it is a shame to preach, to teach, to speak, or to write the same things that others have
Every denomination, every division, and every free group is based upon a certain so-called truth other than the New Testament ministry
The ministry of John the Baptist initiated the ministry of Christ, and the ministry of Peter continued Christ's ministry
Paul's ministry continued and further developed all the foregoing ministry and went forward to reach the goal to build up the Body of Christ
If you look at todays situation you will realize that there are many different ministries in addition to this unique New Testament ministry
All of us need to learn this sober lesson and be on the alert not to deviate from the ministry of the New Testament
As you are reading, you need to pick up the crucial points and to recall what you have seen through the Life-studies
You need to keep this one crucial point in mind in all your reading, that Paul's fourteen books are on Christ and the church
When you go out to preach and when you teach, minister, or pray, you carry out all these things according to what you have already learned
In such a case, it is always easy not only for your listeners to lose interest but also for you yourself because there is no freshness
Suppose you are learning something further concerning mathematics above the university level in graduate school
As a graduate student in mathematics, your presentation to the elementary students is very interesting to them
After you have finished the reading, you need to take a subject such as the incarnation of Christ and study this matter in Paul's writings
You need to put all the verses concerning the incarnation of Christ together and pray-undoubtedly you will see something there
He tells us that what he is going to write is the gospel of God, which was spoken by the prophets in the past, concerning His Son
To say that Christ came out of the seed of David according to the flesh is directly related to His incarnation
In the opening word of Romans, however, the apostle Paul does not tell us that the gospel is concerning these matters
There is no need to look for some new thought or to pick up some peculiar point to present a message different from mine
It was not my intention that you get into such a study to dig out some peculiar points or some strange thoughts
He warned us and cautioned us not to lay another foundation, but he encouraged us to build upon the foundation he had laid
You need to do your work in the field or sphere of Christ for the church with care lest you get out of this sphere
A portrait had been set up in Mark, but it needed some interpretation, some development, of the definition of that portrait
Rather, the Lord's recovery is like a unique school with one field and only one major, and the major is Christ for the church
In the Lord's recovery there are no other majors, and all of us need to concentrate our study in this one major
In Brother Nee's time in the messages concerning God's desire, he went only as far as to use the term God's plan
If you knew the situation there at that time, you would realize that there was a big opening for my work in all of North China
We need to realize, brothers, that to cover even the points we have already mentioned adequately may take nearly ten years
The Lord blessed the work there, and many of you here were captured by the Lord and became trainees under my teaching there
The number of those meeting with us is listed as 45,000, and the third largest is the True Jesus Church with 20,000
What you need is a very thorough study of the divine revelation with the help of the Life-studies of the Bible
If any of the professors in the universities tried to do an easy work, they could not get the results they need
If you would go to other fields, leaving the field of Christ and the church, that would mean that you drop the Lord's recovery
Although the Gospel of John is a Gospel of life, Christ being life to us cannot be seen there in a very practical way
In the Gospel of John we are told only that this Son of God is life, and that He came that we might have life and have it more abundantly
The source of the content of the church and also the very constituents of the constitution of the church are Christ, the Spirit, and life
You need to study how Christ is the source, the very constituent for the constitution of the church in the fourteen Epistles of Paul
All of these items are big and crucial aspects in Paul's writings, and all of them have not been covered adequately
Simply by studying Paul's writings, you will be very much enriched, and all the churches under your teaching will be enriched
From the initiation of John the Baptist, the New Testament ministry goes on to Christ as its major part and its foundation
It was not until we moved to Taiwan that the Lord began to show us that the Body of Christ is the fullness, not only of Him, but also of God
The major, Christ and the church, has remained the same; nevertheless, again and again this major has been further developed
Lord, we pray that Your word might be so clear to us, that we may see what is in Your heart, what is revealed in Your Word
In such a spirit and with such a prayer before the Lord, we want to continue our fellowship concerning the New Testament ministry
In chapter two of his first Epistle Peter tells us that Christ carried up our sins in His body onto the cross in order that we might live
In brief, the grace of life is the Triune God processed to become the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling Spirit
The Triune God is now within us as the grace of life Paul also touched the matter of the grace of life but never expressed it in these terms
You cannot find the expression the grace of life in Paul's writings, but you can see the same thing covered in Romans 5
Paul used these two words, grace and life, in Romans 5:21, but he never composed these two words together into a phrase, the grace of life
In chapter five Peter's exhortation concerning the eldership is altogether related to the living of the elders
The first few verses of the first chapter of 2 Peter tell us that God has given us all the things relating to life
The way Peter refers to 'our beloved brother Paul' and highly commends Paul's writings indicates that Peter was for Paul's ministry
If you get into these few points, the entire book will become your constituents so that you are constituted with this divine life
Whatever is found in Revelation is not a new item, but rather the full development of a particular item that has been presented already
Item after item which is presented in Revelation is the full development of something already presented in the Old Testament
In theology, to indicate the Father you simply say the first in the Trinity, and everyone understands that you are speaking of the Father
After naming first Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, verse 4 continues, 'And from the seven Spirits who are before His throne'
The second is not the Son, but the Spirit, and the Spirit here is not one Spirit but seven Spirits, a sevenfold development
In the development of the Divine Trinity in Revelation 1:4, the first becomes Jehovah, and the second becomes the seven Spirits
The third is in verse 5, 'And from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth'
The faithful Witness refers to the Son's earthly life, and the Firstborn of the dead refers to His resurrection
In addition, the Ruler of the kings of the earth refers to His ascension, to His present situation, and to His coming back
Neither the term the Father nor the term the Son is used in these two verses, and the Spirit is mentioned as 'the seven Spirits'
If you are going to accept any of the creeds, it is as if you need to cut your long feet to make them fit into a pair of short shoes
Surely the light in these few verses annuls the entire teaching of the traditional theology concerning the three persons
The verses we have been considering illustrate the way to get into the pure Word of God apart from any influence of traditional teaching
The seven Spirits match the seven churches the seven churches are the seven lampstands and the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb
John who reclined on the bosom of Christ surely saw the Lord Jesus with only two eyes, but in Revelation, he saw the seven eyes of the Lamb
From 1975 we began to see the lampstand as the embodiment of the Triune God with three aspects-the substance, the form, and the expression
These seven lamps that are the expression of the lampstand signify the seven Spirits, that is, the Spirit of God
We should not say that the lampstands are not Christ; rather, we should say that the lampstands are the increase of Christ
In Exodus 25 only Christ was typified in the lampstand, but in Revelation Christ in His increase is signified in the lampstands
We need to see what the ground is for saying that Christ with His seven eyes is for the churches in the fullest development
At least once in writing to a church in the two chapters following chapter one, Christ declares that He has the seven Spirits
In between is a long parenthesis of seventeen chapters that tells of God's dealing with the universe by His governmental administration
In chapter seven is the innumerable multitude of believers, and in chapter twelve are the woman with the manchild
In the lampstand you can see the embodiment of the Triune God but not all the riches detailed in the Triune God applied to His church
If you are burdened to go on in the New Testament ministry of God, you need to go on along this line, in this major, and in this school
Your going on in this line will edify the saints, build up the church, and build up the Body to its fullest extent
If you take another way, you will be out of the unique school, off from this major, and not in the line of the New Testament ministry
We are not controlled by any sectarian denominational teaching, but we should be controlled by this unique New Testament ministry
We will have a ground, a view, and even a standard of measurement so that we will know where to stay, where to go, and where to be limited
