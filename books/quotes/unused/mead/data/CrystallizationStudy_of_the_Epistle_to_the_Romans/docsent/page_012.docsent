   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE GOSPEL OF GOD BEING DYNAMIC POWERFUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO SAVE ALL THE SINNERS WHO WOULD BELIEVE IN IT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 1:16 says that the gospel of God is powerful to save all men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word powerful means dynamic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word comes from the noun dynamo .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It refers to a kind of power like that of a nuclear bomb.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The gospel of God is a dynamo to save people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word dynamo implies an endless power.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, the gospel of God is endlessly powerful dynamic to save all the sinners who would believe in it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whoever believes, whether he is a Jew, a Gentile, a gentleman, or a bank robber, will be saved by this dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 4 there is a story of the Lord s encounter with a sinful Samaritan woman who had been married to five husbands and was living with someone who was not her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When she asked the Lord to give her the living water, He said, Go, call your husband and come here v. 16 . Her husband was the center of her sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To speak to Christ of her husbands was to confess her sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But she confessed in a lying way by saying that she did not have a husband.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord responded, You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even such a one as this Samaritan woman was saved by the powerful gospel in drinking the living water of Christ v. 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Luke 19 there is another story of the Lord s contact with a great sinner, Zaccheus, who was an evil chief tax collector v. 2 . He extorted the people by putting an excessive value on property or income, or increasing the tax of those unable to pay, and would then practice usury.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord paid a visit to his city purposely to meet him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Right after he received the Lord, he said to Him, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much v. 8 . This is the fast issue of the Lord s dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So the Lord said, Today salvation has come to this house v. 9 . This salvation was to save one of God s chosen people who fell into sin to such an extent that he extorted his own people by being a tax collector of the Roman imperialism, showing the powerful, dynamic, salvation, a salvation with an endless power.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A. To Redeem Them</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The gospel of God is powerful to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s salvation is of two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first part is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second part is the direct salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Redemption can be considered a part of God s salvation, because it is the initiation of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, redemption as the initiation becomes the foundation of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, God redeemed the sinners, and this was done judicially.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word judicial means to make lawful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s redemption is judicial because the very sinners He saved are all sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every one is condemned by God s righteousness, and every one, in a sense, has been sentenced by God to death, to perish, according to His righteous law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, all the descendants of Adam, according to God s righteous and holy law, are condemned and sentenced.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now God wants to redeem these condemned and sentenced sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If God would just forgive us without a righteous procedure, He would become a lawless God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For Him to remain in His righteous and holy position, He has to do something to redeem the sinners judicially.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All proper Christians admit that they were redeemed by Christ s paying the price for them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ died and shed His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He died on the cross as our replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible tells us that God decided to crucify Christ Isa 53:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If Christ had not died as our replacement, then God would have become unrighteous in crucifying Christ, because Christ is the only person who is absolutely righteous and just.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One of Charles Wesley s hymns says, Amazing love! how can it be / That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hymns, #296 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The just God-man died for the unjust sinners 1 Pet 3:18 , so His death is called the vicarious death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One just God-man died for many unjust sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a vicarious death is judicial.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God redeemed us judicially by the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To redeem, in a sense, is to purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you purchase something, you have to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s redemption is a kind of purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God purchased us sinners judicially by paying Christ s blood as the price on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By reading the Gospels, we can see that Christ was hanging on the cross for six hours, from nine o clock in the morning until three o clock in the afternoon Mark 15:25; Matt 27:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These six hours are divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the first section, the Jews associated with the Roman soldiers killed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Jesus was persecuted to death on the cross by both the Jews and the Romans for three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then suddenly at noon darkness fell over all the land.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That was an indication that God came in to deal with the dying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That was God s judgment on Christ, because it was at that juncture, as Isaiah 53 says, that God put all man s sin upon Christ, considering Him as the unique sinner vv.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord Jesus told us in the Gospels that the Father God was always with Him John 8:16, 29 , but when Christ was hanging on the cross in the last three hours, He cried out, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that very juncture on the cross, when God put all man s sin upon Him, in God s eyes He was the unique sinner in replacement of all the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, God left Him economically.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then Christ asked, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to answer, Lord Jesus, because of my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was dying for us, carrying out a vicarious death for all mankind on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God redeemed us judicially by the blood of Christ Rom 3:24-25 on the cross 1 Pet 2:24a from our sins Rev 1:5b .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These are the outward sins in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God also redeemed us from His righteous judgment, wrath, and condemnation Rom 2:5-6, 16; 3:19b; John 3:18b and from eternal perdition in the lake of fire Rev 21:8; 22:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To perish in the lake of fire is God s sentence to us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have also been redeemed from the accusation of Satan, God s enemy cf.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rev 12:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We were redeemed through the forgiveness of sins Eph 1:7 and the washing of the believing sinners sins Rev 1:5b; 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To forgive is one thing, but the stain of sin is still there.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>So following the forgiving, we need the washing to take away the stain.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We were also redeemed by the blood of Christ through the reconciliation of the believing sinners to God from their enmity toward God Rom 5:10a .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We sinners were God s enemies, and there was enmity between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Christ s death reconciled us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the reconciliation through which God redeemed us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We were redeemed through the justification of the believing sinners by God Rom 3:20-24 and the making of peace between the believing sinners and God Rom 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Through Christ s redemption, we have been forgiven, washed, reconciled, and justified, so peace has been made between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Finally, our redemption was through the sanctification of the believing sinners unto God positionally Heb 10:10, 14, 29b; 13:12a .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In our position we have been sanctified unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God has accepted us as saints.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is why 1 Corinthians 1:2 refers to us as the called saints.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We are the called saints through so many steps, starting from forgiveness to sanctification positionally.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our redemption is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Such a redemption lays the foundation of God s dynamic salvation for the consummation of God s dynamic salvation.</S>
