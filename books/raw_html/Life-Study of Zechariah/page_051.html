<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROPHECIES OF ENCOURAGEMENT</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Zech. 12:10-14; 13:1-9</H1><P>In the previous message we saw Israel's destiny in the great war of Armageddon. In this message we will consider the prophecy of encouragement concerning Israel's household salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In Their Household Salvation</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Hardness Coming upon a Part of Israel</H2><P>Romans 11:25b says that a hardness has come upon Israel in part until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in. In the present time, God seemingly has forsaken Israel, and Israel has become somewhat hard. This hardness will continue until the age of the Gentiles has been fulfilled.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. All Israel to Be Saved</H2><P>When the fullness of the Gentiles comes in, all Israel will be saved (Rom. 11:26-27). This will be Israel's household salvation. On the same day and at the same time, thousands of Israelites will be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Perhaps Taking Place While<br>the Great War of Armageddon Is About to End</H2><P>It may be that this household salvation of Israel will take place while the great war of Armageddon is about to end (cf. Zech. 14:2-3). At the end of the war of Armageddon, Christ will come to earth, and the remnant of Israel will see Him whom they have pierced, will repent and wail, and will believe in Christ and receive Him (Rev. 1:7; Zech. 12:10). In this way all Israel will be saved. This will be the household salvation rendered to Israel by God.</P>
