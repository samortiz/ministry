   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"It is written."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is one of the principles of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When temptation comes, it is true that our withstanding enables us to hold our position and causes the devil to flee James 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, most of the time, this will only bring about a deadlock.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if we declare the word of God, the devil will flee.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word of God is the sword of the Spirit Eph 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we wield it, we gain the victory.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible should not be quoted in a careless way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What the Lord is showing here was that the first time He Himself quoted the Scriptures because God had given the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the second time, since God had not given the word, if He had cast Himself down, He would have tempted God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To have faith is to do according to what God has said; to tempt God is to decide to do something when God has not said it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Faith has only one principle: God has said it and I believe it.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>/ Thus I will bring you into captivity" Amos 5:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 4:23 says, "The Father also seeks such to worship Him."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Greek word rendered "seeks" is emphatic.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father has to seek for worshippers because Satan is trying to rob God of the worship from men.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord rebuked the tempter three times with the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first two times He did not point out that the tempter was Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, the third time, because the tempter was attempting to rob God of worship, the Lord pointed out that he was Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord also quoted the Scriptures, saying, " You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve" Matt 4:10; Deut 6:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord is coming soon.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 12-17:Although John was put into prison, the Lord continued the message preached by John v. 17 . Although the first one who preached the message concerning the kingdom of the heavens was imprisoned, the nature of his message was not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verses 18-22:Peter was called when he was casting a net; John was called when he was mending nets.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, what Peter did every time was a work of net-casting, and what John did every time was a work of net-mending.</S>
