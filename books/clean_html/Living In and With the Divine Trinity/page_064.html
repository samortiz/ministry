<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Obtain the Out-resurrection<br>from among the Dead as Our Reward</H2><P>We want to be those who know Christ and the power of His resurrection to be conformed to His death so that we can obtain the out-resurrection from among the dead as our reward (Phil. 3:11-14). In Greek the word for resurrection in Philippians 3:11 has the prefix "ex" before it. "Ex" means extra. This resurrection is the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints. This particular resurrection will be a great reward to us. We cannot reach or obtain this out-resurrection without the power of Christ's resurrection to conform us to the mold of His death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Manifesting Forbearance and Expressing<br>the Virtue and Praise of God in Whatever<br>Is True, Honorable, Righteous, Pure,<br>Lovely, and Well-Spoken of</H2><P>When we live with the Divine Trinity according to what is revealed of God operating in us in Philippians, we manifest forbearance and express the virtue and praise of God in whatever is true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of (4:5, 8). In Philippians 4:5 Paul said, "Let your forbearance be known to all men." This is to manifest forbearance. We saw in chapter eleven that the significance of the word forbearance is to be humble, to give in, to fit in any kind of situation, and to be able to be with any kind of person under any kind of circumstance. Forbearance implies humility, meekness, endurance, and patience. We need to let this virtue of forbearance be known to others, and this is to manifest the forbearance of Christ. In 2 Corinthians 10:1 Paul entreated the saints through the meekness and forbearance of Christ. This is the forbearance of Christ which Paul lived and mentioned in Philippians 4. We also need to express the virtue and praise of God in whatever is true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of. These virtues are the expression of a person who is living Christ for Christ's magnification. When Christ is magnified, these virtues will be expressed. Then there will be praise to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>By the Secret in Taking Christ<br>as Our Satisfaction</H2><P>We manifest forbearance and express the virtue and praise of God by the secret in taking Christ as our satisfaction (Phil. 4:12). We mentioned that "the secret" indicates being ushered into a secret society. Paul used this to illustrate that we Christians are ushered into a particular society, and this particular society is the church, the Body of Christ. In this secret society, Christ is the secret whom we need to learn for our initiation. We must take Christ as our secret so that we can enjoy Him all the time as our satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Strengthened in Christ for All Things</H2><P>Eventually, we will be strengthened in Christ, in the One who empowers us to do all things (Phil. 4:13). Christ empowers us, makes us dynamic from within, not from without. By such an inward empowering, Paul could do all things in Christ. Thank the Lord for the revelation of living with the Divine Trinity in the book of Philippians!</P>
