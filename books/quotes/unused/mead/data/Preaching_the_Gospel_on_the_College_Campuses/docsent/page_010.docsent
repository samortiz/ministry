   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOMES AS AN ADDITIONAL HELP IN THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Without the basics of prayer and the Word, our gospel preaching will be ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we still need another practical help to make our gospel preaching work prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we only have prayer and the word without this little help, our work will not be as effective as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This little additional help is the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The book of Acts records that the apostles preached the gospel from house to house Acts 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the end of Acts, Paul preached the gospel in a rented lodging, a house, not a chapel or cathedral Acts 28:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before he was put into prison, Paul rented a house for the purpose of preaching and speaking the word to people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you preach a gospel message in a cathedral, it will not be as attractive as the same message preached in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>People who are saved in homes often become very useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>George M ller is a good example of a useful brother who was saved in a home.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our homes have several advantages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In America many freshmen attend college away from home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since they are considered full-grown, they may leave home once they have graduated from high school.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many of them are lonely and homesick.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we invite them into our living rooms for a little snack or perhaps a dinner, they will feel at home and this will open them to the Lord and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, people do not have a goal and they are tired of their old manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This situation is sovereign of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once a young person graduates from high school, he usually begins to think about the goal and meaning of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many young people today do not have a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are wondering what to do and where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They do not have a goal in their human life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The material riches of America cannot satisfy the hearts of the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we must take this opportunity to fill up the gap in their hearts with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The best way to do this is by opening up our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>PRACTICAL FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The way to open up the homes is in the Body in a coordinated way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not try to do it by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I hope every local church will have a good coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Pray, fellowship, and see if there are any homes near the campus in your locality that are available.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Try to get a home close to the campus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if you have to pay more rent for a house close to the campus, it is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This matter requires much fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is also a need to fellowship concerning who will go to the campus and who will stay home to take care of practical matters such as cooking and washing dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The financial matters also require a good coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A person may have the financial ability to rent or purchase a house but not have the ability to afford food and refreshments.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One brother may have a house but not much money, whereas another brother may have some money but not a house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One brother may make an offering so that snacks can be served to the seeking young ones that come to another brother's house.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the saints in each locality have to coordinate together for the gospel work on the college campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If in the Lord's sovereignty, an elderly couple gets a house close to the campus, they might need help with all the practical work around the house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If they cannot sweep, vacuum, or cook, they can still pray and eat with the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then others can help with the shopping, cooking, and dishwashing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the saints in every locality are well coordinated, the new ones will be inspired with what they see.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They will see the real social life, communal life, and family life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our service in coordination will touch, soften, and warm up their heart to receive the living, piercing word Heb 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once a freshman is brought into your living room, most of the work is already done.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose a locality has fifteen homes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every home could serve at least ten to fifteen students.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>With just fifteen homes about two hundred students could be served.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The freshmen, who have left their homes, may feel especially lonely and homesick on the weekends.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before the weekend, our young people should contact them and make appointments with them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In one week they could make twenty appointments.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once the appointments have been made, there is the need for further coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is the need for singing, for someone to give a short message, and for many speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is enough to keep everyone busy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some may say that this is too much and that it would cost too much money.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if we do not spend our money in this way, how are we going to spend it?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we spend our money to gain the young people, the more we spend, the more the Lord will give.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All the money and time that we spend on the church life is put into a savings account.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This savings account is not in a bank but in the heavens Phil 4:15-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We deposit in this account by our giving to the Lord for His interests.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we have a burden for preaching the gospel, we must take care of three things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>First, we have to pray; second, we have to speak the word; and third, we have to use our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should be aggressive and active in the Spirit for the spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can fill each city with our gospel tracts and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We can also fill our homes up with young people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We do not need any gimmicks, but we must have two basic things prayer and the word with the additional help of our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must follow the early apostles and disciples by taking the way of prayer, the word, and the homes for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
