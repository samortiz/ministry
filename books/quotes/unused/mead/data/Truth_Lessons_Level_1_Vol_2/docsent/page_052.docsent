   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gospel revealed in the New Testament is not a kind of doctrine or ism, nor is it a theory or a philosophy; neither is it any kind of blessing or benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The gospel is concerning a living person, the God-man, concerning what He is and does, and all that He has attained and obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the early days the apostles and believers preached this mysterious and wonderful One as the gospel Acts 5:42; 8:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore this gospel is not only called the gospel of Jesus Christ Mark 1:1 and the gospel of Christ Rom 15:19; 2 Cor 10:14 , but also the gospel of the glory of Christ 2 Cor 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This gospel of glory, which is Christ Himself, is also called the gospel of God Rom 1:1; 2 Cor 11:7 , because it is planned and accomplished by God; the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens Matt 4:23; 24:14 , because it brings in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens; the gospel of grace Acts 20:24 , because it brings to us the grace of life of the Triune God; the gospel of peace Eph 2:17; 6:15 , because it brings peace between us and God and between man and man; and the gospel of salvation Eph 1:13 , because it brings us salvation that we may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This gospel is also called the glad tidings Rom 10:15 and is worthwhile for us to preach at every time and in every place throughout our whole life.</S>
