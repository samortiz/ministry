   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE LEADING OF THE APOSTLES According to the teaching of God s New Testament economy John 14:25-26; 16:12-15; Acts 2:42; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 6:3; Col 1:25 Not to practice what is beyond the Scripture s teaching 1 Cor 4:6 Teach what the apostle teaches 2 Tim 2:2, 15 Be imitators of the apostle who is the imitator of Christ 1 Cor 11:1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The four items in chapter four should be followed by the four items listed above.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen in chapter four that all the churches should be identical.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no excuse whatsoever for a church to be different in any positive thing or in any positive way from the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Any kind of difference should be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have quoted many verses to prove to you and to confirm to you that the need of all the churches to be identical is the truth according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Based upon the four points we have covered in the last chapter, no excuse can be taken for any church to be different in the positive things from any other church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all are local churches, yet we are still the one Body of the unique Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A body cannot have all its members different in life, in nature, or in color.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no ground for anyone among us, especially in the Lord s recovery, to say that any difference in the positive things among the churches can be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the churches should be identical, and all the churches should follow the apostles leading as indicated in the four points above.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus as the Head took the lead when He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus was the unique Leader.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter was not the leader nor was James or John.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of them took the Lord as the Leader.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was their one Lord and they were all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They did not call any others Lord; there was only one Lord among them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even before the Lord s ascension they called Him Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus Himself even told the disciples that they only have one Lord, one Master, who is the unique Leader Matt 23:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the evening of the day of His resurrection the Lord breathed Himself into His believers, and after His ascension He poured Himself out upon all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At this point who could be the leading one among the disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a great matter for us to consider.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter declared to the Jews on the day of Pentecost that God has made Him both Lord and Christ this Jesus whom you crucified Acts 2:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although the ascended Christ is the Lord of the believers, in practice there must be some kind of physical leading that people can see.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now that the Lord has ascended, this physical leading is not in the Lord Himself as an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After His ascension, this leading is now in some members of His Body who can really represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These representing members, according to the New Testament, are the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Greek word for apostle is apostolos, which simply means the one sent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>An apostle is a sent one, but merely by this definition we cannot have a proper understanding of who an apostle is, especially the apostle that all the believers need to recognize as their leader.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Acts the Lord s work on this earth was in two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first twelve chapters form one section and the leader in this section was Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the last sixteen chapters of Acts, from chapter thirteen to chapter twenty-eight, is the second section of the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this section of Acts, Paul was the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There were not two leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Barnabas and Paul traveled together and eventually Paul became the leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In his Epistles, Paul was so frank to tell us his standing as the leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The New Testament shows us that the Lord s move on this earth was always with two leaders the Apostle Peter and the Apostle Paul.</S>
