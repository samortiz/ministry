<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Discerning Death and Resurrection</H2><P>An elder must also be able to discern whether a brother or sister has passed through the death of the cross and whether he or she is a person living in resurrection. Perhaps certain ones are still in the natural realm, because the things they say come from their natural and ethical concepts. Perhaps within them there is still the flesh, indignation, and some other things. Perhaps within them there is still insincerity and ambition. Whenever you contact people, pick up a conversation, or encounter a certain matter, you must have this ability to discern. You should not only discern whether a person fears God, but also if he has passed through the death of the cross and is in resurrection in everything, in every point, in every conversation, and in every proposal. An elder should have such an ability to discern.</P><P>It may be the same opinion and the same suggestion, but when it comes from one who has passed through death and resurrection, the Holy Spirit within you will give a certain response or a certain echo. On the contrary, if it is suggested by one who has not passed through the death of the cross, who is not living in resurrection, but is living in the natural realm, in his ethical concept, or if it is suggested by a fleshly, indignant, insincere person, or one with other motives, the Holy Spirit will give you another reaction within. This is a great factor in the elders' administration of the church.</P><P>A brother may say to an elder, "I feel that next week we should preach the gospel." If that elder has spiritual discernment, he might not accept the suggestion. This does not mean that it is wrong to preach the gospel, but the elder touches something impure in this one who suggests this matter. Perhaps the elder can take the same suggestion from another person, because this one has passed through the cross and is in resurrection; his spirit is pure, and there is no mixture within him. Only through such discernment by the elders can the service in the church be so pure and so free from the natural realm, the human concepts, the human inclinations, and the human ideas, and be in resurrection.</P><P>For example, some brother may say: "Brother, now is the best time to preach the gospel. I received the news today that in ten days a certain denomination will conduct an evangelistic campaign. We should seize the opportunity first. We should not let others seize the initiative." Let me ask the brothers and sisters, Is this thought good? Indeed, it is not good. Although what this brother tells you is a good thing and his motive is good, you can sense that this brother has not been dealt with by the cross; he is still in his natural person, and he is still competing with others. Gospel preaching is a good thing, but in this matter, you can touch that this man has never been crucified by the cross.</P><P>Therefore, in any matter which brothers or sisters suggest to us, although they may be good and may be for the church, the elders must discern if the persons have passed through the cross and if they are in resurrection.</P>
