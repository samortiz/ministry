   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Abraham s wife Sarah and his concubine Hagar typify the two covenants which God made with His chosen people concerning their inheriting of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sarah symbolizes the covenant of God s promise, and Hagar, the covenant of law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s promise is fulfilled not by the energy of man s flesh but by God s grace for those who inherit the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is God who promises, and it is also God who fulfills what He has promised.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man s flesh is of no use at all; it cannot fulfill God s promise to us.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since the covenant of law is signified by Hagar, the position of the law is like that of a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As such, the law has no rightful position in God s economy.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It signifies that the New Testament believers must pass through the dealing of the cross to put off the flesh that they may inherit and enjoy all the riches in Christ promised by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Circumcision was performed on the eighth day, signifying that we must receive the dealing of the cross in resurrection for the cutting off of our flesh, that the God of all-sufficiency and bountiful supply may come into us to be our everything for the accomplishment of His economy.</S>
