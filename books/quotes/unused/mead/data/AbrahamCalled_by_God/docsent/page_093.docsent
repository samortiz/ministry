   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>21 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THE OFFERING OF ISAAC 1 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 22:2 By faith Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac; indeed he who gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten, of whom it was said, "In Isaac shall your seed be called"; counting that God was able to raise men even from the dead, from which he also received him back in figure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 11:17-19</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we come to Genesis 22, where we see the climax of Abraham's experience with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This chapter is the continuation of chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two chapters, giving the record of the birth and offering of Isaac, cover a period of at least twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some scholars believe that when Isaac was offered he was at least twenty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, he was a full-grown man by then.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything recorded in these two chapters is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we pointed out in the last message, in 21:33, "Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This planting of the tamarisk tree was not an insignificant thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although Abraham must have done many things while he was living in Beer-sheba, the Bible only records that he contended for the well, bought it back at a cost, planted a tamarisk tree, and called on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If these were insignificant things, the biblical record, which is very economical, would not have included them as part of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fact that the divine revelation excludes many other things but includes the record of the planting of a tamarisk tree shows its importance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The center of the revelation in Genesis 2 is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Likewise, the center of the revelation in the second part of Genesis 21 is the tamarisk tree.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have the spiritual realization with the divine light, we shall see that the tamarisk tree here is the tree of life experienced and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the tree of life is not experienced or expressed by us, it is simply the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But once we experience and express it, it becomes a tamarisk tree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A tamarisk tree has slender branches and very fine leaves showing the flow of the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the tamarisk tree planted by the well of an oath in Beer-sheba pictures the flow of the riches of life, the issue of the experience of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is the tree of life a tamarisk tree in your experience?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever we come to the meetings, the tree of life must become a tamarisk tree.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With Ishmael there was not a tree flowing with the riches of life; there was a bow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While the sign of Ishmael's life was a life-killing bow, the sign of Isaac's life was a life-flowing tree.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a Christian, a child of God and a descendant of Abraham, what is your sign a bow or a tamarisk tree?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Are you killing life, or is life with all its riches flowing in you?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the tree of life in Genesis 2 is important, then the tamarisk tree in Genesis 21 must also be important.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Very few Christians, if any, have seen the importance of the tamarisk tree at Beer-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although some have paid a little attention to the tree of life, they have not paid attention to the tamarisk tree.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the past we did see the tree of life, but we did not see the tamarisk tree.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thank the Lord that in these days He has given us the vision of the tamarisk tree.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day, the inward stirring told me that I had to know the significance of the tamarisk tree in chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although this chapter does not waste a word, ignoring the other things that Abraham must have done, it specifically says that he planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to our opinion, the planting of a tamarisk tree may be insignificant, perhaps being only an ancient type of landscaping.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the Bible connects the planting of the tamarisk tree with calling on a new title of the Lord, the Eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Notice how the conjunction "and" is used to connect these two items in 21:33.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree and there called on the name of Jehovah, El Olam.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to our human thought, planting a tree is unrelated to calling on the name of the Lord, especially to such a new and recently revealed title.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in the Bible here it gives us the ground for the proper calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we would call on the name of the Lord, we need a tamarisk tree.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not have this tamarisk tree experience, we can only call on the old title of God, Jehovah, not on His newly unveiled title, El Olam.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In chapter twenty-one, Abraham called on a new title of God El Olam, the mysterious, hidden, secret, yet so real, living, and ever-existing God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This title of God implies the term eternal life, for the eternal God means the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Abraham experienced the eternal life, but he did not have this term.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The people in ancient times ate vitamins, but they had no scientific knowledge of them nor scientific terms to describe them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because we were born after the writing of the New Testament, we have the term eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But Abraham, who lived in ancient times, did not have such a divine term.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nevertheless, when he called on the name of Jehovah, El Olam, it is implied that he experienced God as the ever-existing and ever-living life, as the One who is real and living, yet so mysterious and secret.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to consider our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever we have had the flow of the riches of the divine life, that was the time when we called on the name of the Lord Jesus with a new realization.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We called on the same Lord, but in our calling we had a fresh sense.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do you think that if you held the life-killing bow in your hand you would be able to call on the Lord's name?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No, rather you would go to find an Egyptian wife.</S>
