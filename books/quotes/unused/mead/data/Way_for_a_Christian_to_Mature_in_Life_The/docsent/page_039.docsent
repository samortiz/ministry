   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE WAY FOR A CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO MATURE IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>PAYING THE PRICE TO BUY THE OIL</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew 25:3-4 mentions two things that are absolutely different one is the lamp and the other is the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The difference between the foolish virgins and the prudent virgins does not concern their lamps but the contents of their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The prudent prepared oil in their vessels while the foolish did not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 7 says, Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their own lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse mentions only lamps, not vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then verse 8 says, And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse proves that the lamps of the foolish virgins were burning but were soon about to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This also implies that there was no problem with their lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, the problem was that they did not take oil in their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to pay attention to what the lamp, the vessel, the oil in the lamp, and the oil in the vessel signify.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we will know what our problem is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Proverbs 20:27 clearly tells us, The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, / Searching all the innermost parts of the inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The lamp is the human spirit within us, and our spirit is the lamp of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jehovah has a lamp in us, which is the spirit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God searches every part of our inner being using this lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The parts of our inner being are the parts of the human soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE OUTER MAN BEING THE SOUL AND</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE INNER MAN BEING THE REGENERATED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second Corinthians 4:7 says, But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The treasure in this verse is the life of God and the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The earthen vessel refers to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 16 says, Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The outer man is our natural man, our soul, whereas the inner man is our regenerated new man, our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, the vessel mentioned in the previous verse refers to our outer man, our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The treasure is the life of God, the Spirit of life, mingled with our inner man, our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, our spirit has the life of God and the Spirit of God, and our outer man, our soul, is a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE SPIRIT BEING THE GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second Corinthians 3:6 says, Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 8 says, How shall the ministry of the Spirit not be more in glory?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 6 mentions the Spirit, and verse 8 mentions glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 6 says that the ministers of the new covenant are made sufficient to be ministers of the Spirit through which man can have life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then verse 8 says that there is glory in the ministry of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the Spirit and glory are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verses 16 and 17 say, But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our turning our heart to the Lord is our turning to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever the veil is taken away, the Spirit works to set us free.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 18 says, But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that our being transformed into the image of the Lord is our being transformed from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our being transformed from glory to glory is also from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, our being transformed from the Lord Spirit is our being transformed from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Anyone who knows Greek should realize that this verse shows us that our transformation from glory to glory and our transformation from the Lord Spirit are the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are two matters that refer to the same matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This proves that glory and the Spirit are one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John 7:39 says, But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This also proves that glory and the Spirit are related.</S>
