   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Compounding of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being a Matter of Inclusion</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What we have in Exodus 30 is the compound ointment as a type of the compound life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The actual compounding of the Spirit took place in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was in resurrection that the very God embodied in Christ and mingled with His humanity was compounded with Christ's death, the effectiveness of Christ's death, Christ's resurrection, and the power of His resurrection to produce the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This compounding was a matter of inclusion, for in the compound life-giving Spirit six items are included.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the life-giving Spirit may be called the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit who includes divinity, humanity, the death of Christ and its effectiveness, and the resurrection of Christ and its power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit Breathed into the Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whereas the incarnation was an objective matter, this inclusion is subjective to us and applicable to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to John 20:22 in the evening of the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came as the compound Spirit and breathed into the disciples, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because the disciples were the representatives of the Body, we all were present when the Spirit was breathed into them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time the Spirit was breathed into the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as the arm may receive an injection for the benefit of our physical body, so the disciples in John 20 received the Spirit for the whole Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a part of the Body, those disciples represented the Body in receiving the inclusion, in receiving the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because we can experience Christ in the stage of inclusion in such a subjective way, in this stage He is more applicable to us than He was in the stage of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>INTENSIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not too long after the church was formed, it became degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church should issue in the Body of Christ, but regrettably, as the Epistles reveal, the church gradually became degraded, even at Paul's time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because of this degradation, the compound life-giving Spirit was intensified sevenfold to become the sevenfold intensified Spirit Rev 1:4; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This sevenfold intensified Spirit is for the overcoming of the degradation of the church and the producing of the overcomers so that the Body of Christ can be built up in a practical way to consummate the New Jerusalem, which is the unique and eternal goal of God's heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From the foregoing we can see the history of Christ in three stages: incarnation, inclusion, and intensification.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the first stage incarnation Christ was the Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the second stage inclusion Christ is the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now in the third stage intensification Christ is the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to know Christ in all three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we know the three stages of incarnation, inclusion, and intensification, we will truly know the Bible.</S>
