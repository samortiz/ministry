   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE LORD'S JUDGMENT OF THE GENTILES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AFTER THE WAR OF ARMAGEDDON Scripture Reading: Matt 25:31-46; 13:47-50; Rev 14:6-7; Acts 10:42; 2 Tim 4:1; Matt 19:28; Acts 3:21; Isa 11:6-9</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will fully clear up the situation with the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, the false ones will be bound and thrown into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These are the tares.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then the matured ones will be caught up into the air, along with the resurrected believers, where the Lord will exercise His judgment over them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time some of them will be chosen to be the overcoming ones who will be the Lord's army to fight against the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They will also feast with the Lord at the marriage feast of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some of the Christians will be the defeated ones and, because they are defeated, they will suffer some punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They will miss the marriage feast, the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They will lose their reward, and they will also suffer some kind of dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, by the rapture the Lord Jesus will clear up the whole situation among the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THREE KINDS OF PEOPLES</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we mentioned previously, when the Lord Jesus returns there will be basically three kinds of people upon the earth: the Christians, the Jews, and the Gentiles 1 Cor 10:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At His coming back He will defeat and destroy the Gentile army and rescue the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They will become priests to God during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some Gentiles, however, will still be left on the earth, not having been destroyed with the armies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although so many horsemen and soldiers will have been destroyed by the Lord, some people of the nations will be left alive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not logical to assume that all of the people will be soldiers and that all will be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, all the armies will be destroyed, but some of the people will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What will happen to those who are left from the nations?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord must clear up the situation with them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To do this He will send His angels to collect all of the people of the nations who remain at that time so that He can exercise His judgment on them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What will be the Lord's basis for judging them?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is difficult for us to say.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Surely it is not a judgment according to the law or to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If it is a judgment according to the gospel, it will be because they did not repent and believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Or if it is a judgment according to the law, it will be because they did not keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the judgment of the remaining nations will not be based upon these two items.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The judgment of the nations at that time will be based upon how they treated the Lord's little brothers during the time of the tribulation Matt 25:31-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By this we can see that the Lord has His dispensation, His way of dealing with people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the dispensation of the law, the Lord dealt with people according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the dispensation of grace, the Lord deals with people according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But during the time of the tribulation the Lord will not deal with the nations according to law or grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, He will deal with them according to how they treated His little brothers, the Jews and remaining Christians, during the time of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the nations treated the least of His brethren well, they will be considered as sheep; but if they treated the little ones poorly, they will be considered as goats and will be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Matthew 25:31-46 covers the parable of the sheep and the goats.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many Christian teachers have made a wrong application of this parable, saying that it refers to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They think that the Lord Jesus will exercise His judgment over the believers, dividing them into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One group will be the real Christians, represented by the sheep; the other group will be the false Christians, represented by the goats.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to their concept, the good ones will be saved to enter into the kingdom, and the bad ones will be cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, this interpretation is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 32 says all the nations shall be gathered before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Greek word here for "nations" is the same word used for "Gentiles."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It will not be the believers who are gathered before Him, but the unbelievers, the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With the Gentiles gathered before Him, the Lord will separate them one from the other as the shepherd divides the sheep from the goats.</S>
