   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH HIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN GALILEE 6 Scripture Reading: Luke 7:1-35</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 7:1-35 three matters are covered: the Man-Savior curing the dying one with a word vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1-10 , the Man-Savior showing pity to the weeping mother by raising up her dead son vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>11-17 , and the Man-Savior strengthening His forerunner vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>18-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It may not seem that there is any connection between these three instances.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, these matters are related.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CURING THE DYING ONE WITH A WORD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Luke 7:1 and 2 say, After He completed all His words in the hearing of the people, He entered into Capernaum.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And a certain centurion s slave, who was highly valued by him, was ill and about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A centurion was an officer over one hundred in the Roman army.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This centurion represents the believing Gentiles, who are saved through faith in the Lord s word v. 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Having heard about Jesus, this centurion sent to Him elders of the Jews, requesting that He might come and bring his slave safely through his illness v. 3 . When these elders reached Jesus, they entreated Him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that You should grant this to him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For he loves our nation, and he himself built the synagogue for us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While the Man-Savior was on His way to the centurion s home, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof; wherefore I did not even count myself worthy to come to You; but say a word, and let my servant be cured vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 8 we have a further word of the centurion conveyed to the Lord Jesus through his friends: For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers; and I tell this one, Go, and he goes; and another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it v. 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 7:1-10 we see authority and the word of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The centurion seemed to be saying to the Man-Savior, Lord, I am not worthy to come to see You or for You to come to my house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet I know what authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am under the authority of others, and others are under my authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All I need to do is speak a word to one of the soldiers, and he does what I say.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I know, Lord, that You are the authority in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How did this Roman centurion, a Gentile, come to know the Lord s authority?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to verse 5, he loved the Jewish nation and built a synagogue for the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From this we see that probably he had some knowledge of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, he referred to the Man-Savior as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, he realized that the Man-Savior was the One who has the genuine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The centurion also knew the significance of a word of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was the reason he could say to the Man-Savior, Say a word, and let my servant be cured v. 7 . He knew authority and the word as the expression of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The centurion s slave was in fact healed by the word of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 7:9 the Lord Jesus marveled at the centurion s faith: And hearing these things, Jesus marveled at him, and turning to the crowd following Him, He said, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Gentile centurion recognized the authority of the Man-Savior and realized that His word was a word with healing authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, he believed not only in the Man-Savior, but also in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He asked the Lord not to come personally, but only to send His word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Man-Savior marveled at this great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this case also we see the Lord s human virtues with His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His virtue was expressed in the fact of His going to the home of the centurion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus is the Lord of the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, He was willing to go to see an officer in the Roman army.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The centurion had only one hundred soldiers under his authority, but the Lord Jesus has the whole universe under His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Man-Savior s human virtue, His divine attribute of authority was expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He spoke a word, and the centurion s slave was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here we see the Lord s divine attribute manifested in His human virtue.</S>
