All the Believers in Christ Are Built Up into a Dwelling Place of God in Their Spirit Indwelt by Him as the Spirit</H2><P>Christ regenerated the believers for His Body that all the believers in Christ may be built up into a dwelling place of God in their spirit indwelt by Him as the Spirit (Eph. 2:22). Here, to be built up is to be constituted together. We are being built up into a dwelling place of God in our spirit indwelt by Him as the Spirit. Ultimately, this dwelling place is the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:3). The New Jerusalem is a city, a large, corporate dwelling place. The dwelling place of a single person is a house; the dwelling place of a multitude is a city. All the believers in Christ will be built up, constituted, that they may be filled with the Spirit, within and without, to become the dwelling place of God. The consummation of such a dwelling place is a large city&#151;the New Jerusalem.</P><P>Such a constitution, such a building, is consummated through dispositional sanctification (Rom. 15:16), renewing (Titus 3:5), transformation (2 Cor. 3:18), and conformation (Rom. 8:29). After regenerating us, God sanctifies us in our disposition, renews us in our old creation, and transforms us in our entire being. Not only so, He conforms us to the image of His firstborn Son that all of us may be God's sons in life and nature and, with His firstborn Son, become God's corporate son as God's expression, God's expansion. The New Jerusalem is such a corporate expression, expansion, and enlargement of God. The Bible begins with "In the beginning God..." (Gen. 1:1). At that time, the unique God was "alone." However, at the end, the Bible mentions a city, the New Jerusalem. This city is not simple, requiring the explanation of the Bible with sixty-six books. This is because this city, the New Jerusalem, is the enlarged God. All the sixty-six books of the Bible explain the enlarged God, the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S PRESENT MOVE AND NEED</H2><P>If you learn all these things which we have fellowshipped, I am confident that a great revival will come to us. First, you need to know that Christ is both God and man. Second, you need to know that Christ possesses both divinity and humanity. Third, you need to know that, in His humanity, Christ accomplished His judicial redemption through His death. Fourth, you need to know that, in His divinity, Christ is carrying out His organic salvation in His resurrection. In such an organic salvation, He brought forth the many sons of God, the many brothers of Christ. The many sons of God constitute the house of God as His dwelling place; the many brothers of Christ constitute His members as His Body, the consummation of which is the New Jerusalem.</P><P>To be able to speak these things thoroughly and clearly, you need to learn. If you want to know how to be elders and co-workers, you need to know Christ and to experience, enjoy, and gain Him according to all that He has accomplished and is accomplishing in the three stages of His full ministry. Do not continue to speak the old things that have been kept for all these years. People have heard enough of them. Where is the vitality of a vital group? The vitality of a vital group lies in the knowledge, enjoyment, and experience of Christ. You must be able to speak forth thoroughly concerning all the crucial points of Christ's accomplishments in His three stages. You may not be able to do it in a short time, but I hope that you will devote much time and energy to this matter. If you can use a half year's time to learn to speak thoroughly the four items concerning Christ which we need to know particularly, especially the last two items, I believe that a revival will come to you. Do not argue or hold on to your own opinions anymore. We all need to endeavor to get into knowing Christ in a particular way.</P><P>In the Memorial Day weekend conference in May 1991, in Anaheim, when I fellowshipped concerning the world situation and the move of the Lord's recovery, I said that in our spreading to Russia we need to pay attention to six things: first, to preach the high gospel; second, to speak the deeper truths; third, to live Christ by His death and resurrection; fourth, to practice the new way; fifth, to practice the one accord; and sixth, to have the full-time training. Accordingly, the brothers in Russia put these six things into practice, resulting in the situation there today. We have been working in Russia for only five years, yet, besides the two big churches raised up in Moscow and St. Petersburg, there are at least thirty-five churches. In other words, there are at least thirty-seven churches in Russia at the present time. In addition to these, there are innumerable denominational groups that have touched the light and truth in the Lord's recovery. They have left the denominations and are desirous of meeting in their respective localities. They are waiting for some among us to go and help them so that they may be established as churches. By the end of this year, there will probably be about fifty churches established in Russia. Such a result is unprecedented in the history of the Lord's recovery.</P><P>On the contrary, when I was earnestly speaking concerning the new way in the United States and Taiwan, I incurred some opposition and rebellion. But, where are the opposing and rebellious ones today? The Lord said that we need to know each tree by its own fruit (Luke 6:44). I do not like to criticize, but I want to sound a warning. What the Lord has shown us in His recovery is the best way. We are in the divine and mystical realm seeing the divine and mystical culture, and we have to speak all these things with the divine and mystical language. I hope that you all will relearn. From now on, to be a co-worker or an elder, you have to do this. There is no other way besides this. I hope that you will not hold big meetings with one person speaking and many people listening. This is the way of Christianity which has been practiced for twenty centuries already yet still has not been able to produce what the Lord is after.</P><P>Today the need of the Lord's recovery is tremendous. This is the reason that we are endeavoring to expand our training. At the inception of the full-time training in Anaheim in 1989, we had only seventy to eighty people in the first term. Thank the Lord that in this term we have two hundred and thirty-nine people. Furthermore, we are building "Grace Gardens," a community of nineteen houses for lodging our trainees. With ten people in each house, we can house nearly two hundred people. We hope that those who have received the full-time training can be sent out to match the Lord's move today.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
