   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being "God's Own Blood" in Acts 20:28</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul said in Acts 20:28 that the blood that Christ shed on the cross was God's own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God bought, purchased, the church with His own blood, so the church is so dear, so beloved, in the feeling of God and in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was the word spoken by Paul to the elders of Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was impressing the elders from Ephesus that they should love the church, considering the church very dear and beloved as God does.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church is so dear and beloved to God in His feeling, so He purchased the church with His own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible in Acts 20:28 says that the divine God has human blood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we have pointed out, Charles Wesley wrote a very good hymn with a good melody, in which he spoke of the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is hymn #296 in our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A number of years ago, I translated this hymn into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Charles Wesley had the boldness to say in this hymn that the immortal God died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am so glad that he declared this truth and that it is printed in the hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God Being One with Christ All the Time</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The crucifixion of Christ was also God's crucifixion because God is one with Christ all the time John 8:29; 16:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God never left Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Christ was incarnated, God was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They coinhered.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Christ was living on this earth, God was living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Christ was crucified, God was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is because They coinhere, that is, They mutually indwell each other.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Gospels Christ told us repeatedly that the Father was in Him and He was in the Father John 10:38; 14:10-11, 20; 17:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, we may say that God died in Christ, so Christ's crucifixion became God's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God died in man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God died not in His own death but in another One's death.</S>
