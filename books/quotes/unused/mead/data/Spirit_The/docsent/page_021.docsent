   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In message five we saw the functions of the Spirit in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we want to see the functions of the Spirit in the four Gospels of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many more functions of the Spirit are revealed in the New Testament than in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Gospel of John reveals more aspects of the Spirit than each of the synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These three Gospels are called synoptic because they correspond closely to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Begetting</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first function of the Spirit in the New Testament is the function of begetting Matt 1:18b, 20b .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matthew 1:20b says, That which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Something was begotten in Mary s womb of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit that begets.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The entire Triune God was begotten of the Spirit in Mary s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God was begotten in man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the greatest wonder and miracle in the whole universe!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the first day of Mary s pregnancy, God was in her womb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the natural principle of God s creation, He stayed there for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew 1:18 and 20 indicate that the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit had been generated in Mary s womb before she delivered the Child Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Baptizing</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit also has the function of baptizing Matt 3:11c; 28:19; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16; John 1:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, according to the Word, the baptizer is not the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The baptizer is either Christ or His disciples, His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why then do we say that the Spirit has the function of baptizing?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matthew 28:19 reveals that we need to baptize the nations into the Triune God, and the Triune God is consummated in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we have the Spirit as the consummation, we have the Father as the source and the Son as the course.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have the Spirit, we have the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be baptized into the Triune God is to be baptized into the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The One whom we baptize people into is more important than the one who baptized them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The One into whom we are baptized is so important because in baptism we are mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To be baptized into the Spirit means that the Spirit mingles us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Spirit puts us into Himself, we are brought into an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This organic union with the Triune God is not accomplished by the baptizer but by the very element into which we have been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we go out to preach the gospel, we baptize people into the Triune God, who has the Spirit as His consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through this baptism, the Spirit mingles the baptized one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This creates an organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In baptism, the baptized one is mingled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we say that the Spirit has the function of baptizing, this is what we mean.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brooding for Ministering</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit also has the function of brooding for ministering Matt 3:16b; Luke 3:22; John 1:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Genesis 1:2 the brooding of the Spirit is for the producing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the New Testament, the dove came down to Jesus and brooded over Him for His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These two instances of the brooding of the Spirit show that the ministry of Jesus was for producing life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The ministering of Christ is to produce life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After this brooding, Jesus began to minister, and His ministry was always to produce life, to dispense life to all His contacts.</S>
