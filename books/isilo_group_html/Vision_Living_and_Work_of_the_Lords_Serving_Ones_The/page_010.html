<p>Now we will consider the most suitable verses to use when speaking about being saved. The first part of Mark 16:16 says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; We can match this verse with Romans 10:13: &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why should we use Mark 16:16 first? In verses 15 and 16 the Lord said, &ldquo;Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation. He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.&rdquo; In Acts 16:31 Paul and Silas said to the jailer in Philippi, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.&rdquo; This verse is also very good. Both of these verses are good because they say that the condition for being saved is to believe. Salvation in these two verses refers to sanctification, forgiveness, cleansing, justification, release, reconciliation, and regeneration.</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul says that we should cut &ldquo;straight the word of the truth.&rdquo; Releasing God&rsquo;s word can be compared to a surgeon performing an operation. A surgeon cannot be careless; he must be precise. In the Recovery Version of the New Testament the footnote to this verse says that the phrase <em>cutting straight</em> is likened to cutting wood. Hence, to cut straight the word of the truth means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion. We should not be confused when we use a verse. Therefore, we need to spend time to learn the lessons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Will Mark 16:16 cause people to misunderstand baptism as a condition for being saved?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Strictly speaking, in order to be saved, one needs to be baptized. If our gospel preaching is powerful enough, a person&rsquo;s salvation will include baptism. In Acts 2:37-38 after the Jews heard the gospel, they were pricked in their heart, and they asked the disciples what they should do. Peter said to them, &ldquo;Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Hence, if our gospel preaching is powerful, people will be baptized. Repentance includes baptism because baptism means burial, which is a genuine change of mind.</p>
<p><em>Question: During one of our visits, we encountered a gospel friend who had a desire to be saved, but because of the confusion in Christianity and the undesirable behavior of some Christians, he was hesitant. In his thought he could be saved only after he understood the Bible. Even though we read Romans 10:13 and Mark 16:16, because of the poor behavior of many Christians, he questioned this salvation. We attempted to differentiate between being saved and overcoming, but he could not accept our explanation. We do not know how to help him.</em></p>
<p>Answer: The question posed by this gospel friend cannot be solved with just one appropriate verse. Nevertheless, we can use the following illustration to help him. A baby needs to be in the womb for nine months before it is born. Before a baby is born, we do not whether he will grow up to be strong. Furthermore, if a few days after birth a baby dies because of an illness, we cannot say that his birth was false. Death is a result of inadequate care after the baby was born. Hence, Christians who are genuinely saved but lack care might have inappropriate behavior. Some people are indeed saved; however, after being saved, they remain like babies. When a baby is conceived, it does not know anything. Even after it is born, it still does not know much. However, after it is born, its life has the capacity to learn. We are regenerated through God&rsquo;s word and of God&rsquo;s life. Regeneration is not based on our understanding. Rather, one is regenerated because he receives God&rsquo;s life with its life element. After being regenerated, a person has the capacity to know and learn all things related to the Christian life. This situation shows that when you preach the gospel, not only must you be clear concerning the truth; you also need to be equipped with examples based on the truth so that you can give an illustration to help people.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Living and Work of the Lord's Serving Ones &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
