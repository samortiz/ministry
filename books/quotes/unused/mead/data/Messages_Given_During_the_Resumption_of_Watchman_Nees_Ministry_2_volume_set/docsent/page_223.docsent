   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Need for the Strongest Point to Be Broken</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The nose is the most conspicuous part of the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a man bumps into the wall, the first thing that hits it is his nose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For many people, when they express themselves, the strongest and most obvious things that come across to others are their cleverness or their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order for a person to serve the Lord, the strongest part of his outward man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only then will his inward man be released.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot be Christians for so many years and yet still remain whole and unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You can say that you have not received great revelations before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But you cannot say that for all these years, you have not received the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The goal of the discipline of the Holy Spirit is for you to be a broken man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day, when you receive God's mercy, you will be able to say that at last you understand what it is to be a broken man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By that time, you will realize how easy it is for your spirit to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order for the inward man to be released, there is the need for severe dealings from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who have never been dealt with cannot afford the Lord a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's Mercy</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every spiritual thing is received by men who are balanced and who are just right in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can neither be too much nor too little.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who are over-zealous in their pursuit will not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Neither will those who are lazy receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we ask, we have to ask in a proper measure; we cannot ask for nothing, and we cannot ask for too much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes when we ask more, it will be too much, and when we ask less, it will be too little.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Spiritual growth does not depend on a person's running.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But then, those who do not run will not receive anything either.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If God grants you mercy, you will run according to just the right measure.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, everyone has to commit himself to the God of all mercies Rom 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do this, we will become just right in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today we can only say that we are those who have experienced God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Spiritual growth is something that is totally beyond man's power to control.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has to put us in a place of total inability and total helplessness before He can have a way in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the Lord is merciful to us, we will get through.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the Lord is not merciful to us, we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many people receive frequent chastisements, yet their outward man is not broken at all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to become a minister, the only way is for us to look to God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one can be in haste in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Having a Deeper Knowledge of the Lord's Life</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>through the Lord's Dealings</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother Yu Cheng-hwa asked: Can we say that the content of the ministry is our knowledge of life?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Nee answered: We know the Lord by learning the lessons through His dealings and His smitings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When our outward man is broken, we will begin to know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A man knows the Lord through the process of being smitten.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we are smitten by the Lord day by day, our knowledge of the Lord will increase day by day, and we will see how His life replaces our life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not an increase in life, but an increase in knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have this life already.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But through the Lord's dealings, we will gain a deeper knowledge of this life.</S>
