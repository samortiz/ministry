<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>MIGRATION</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (10)</H1><P>Date:January 21, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><P>Prayer: Lord, do not allow us to walk in darkness. Give us the light, and make our light shine as the dawning of the day until midday. Lord, we believe that our prayers will be heard and answered. Lord, make us healthy within and without. When we preach the gospel tonight, may others receive mercy through seeing the love that the brothers and sisters express toward You. Lord, may our future be clear, and may all those who grope in darkness see the light. Forgive us for limiting Your ways.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WHOLE BODY<br>VOLUNTARILY RISING UP TO SERVE</H2><P>It is a difficult thing to help the brothers and sisters to become useful before the Lord. It is easy for us to go to various places to preach the gospel and to give a few messages. But to remain in a place to serve the Lord properly, be coordinated together, and fulfill the function of each one, is a very difficult thing. This is something that the co-workers must pay attention to in the future. If this matter is carried out properly, God will have an oracle and a mouthpiece here. It is not right for the co-workers to see results only when they themselves are working, but not to see results when they are not working. A local church must be something organic; it must be on the move all the time. The co-workers must have an adequate amount of spiritual life, and they must have a proper view to promote this matter. When the elders and the co-workers are not there, the brothers and sisters should still continue to work. When that happens, the co-workers are free to go to work in another place. A built-up church is one that mobilizes by itself and that functions by itself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WORKING IN ONE ACCORD,<br>SETTING THE MIND ON THE THINGS OF THE LORD</H2><P>We should not consider our own house more than we consider God's house. Rather, we should set our minds on the things of the Lord. We are not here to do a scattered work. Today, we have to work in one accord. Only then will the Lord have a way among us. The co-workers and the elders have to help one another, for the co-workers may be away from a locality at times, and the elders have to fill in the gap at those times.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TO BE A PROPER PERSON<br>THROUGH DOING THE WORK</H2><P>We have to learn to be a proper person. In serving the Lord, the main thing is not our work, but to learn to be a proper person through doing the work. One of the basic trainings in serving the Lord is to learn to be a proper person through doing the work.</P>
