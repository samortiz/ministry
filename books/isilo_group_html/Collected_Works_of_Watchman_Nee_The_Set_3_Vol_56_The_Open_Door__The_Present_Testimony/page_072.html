Everything Paul speaks of, from chapter one to chapter thirteen, is all according to this principle. If we summarized Paul's message in this book, we could cover everything with his words in chapter four, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels." In chapter one we see this treasure being put into the earthen vessel. From 3:1 through the end of the book, we see the earthen vessel on the one hand and the treasure on the other hand. After reading these words before God, we spontaneously will see under His enlightenment that the earthen vessel does not hinder the treasure from shining. The earthen vessel does not bury the power of the treasure.</p><p>Here we see a person. We have mentioned before that 2 Corinthians is the most personal book in the New Testament. Many Epistles are filled with doctrine, truth, and revelation. Many Epistles move from God's point of view to our point of view. Second Corinthians, however, is the only book in the New Testament which shows us the very kind of person whom God used to pass on His revelation. If we did not have the book of 2 Corinthians, we would never know Paul himself. We would know what he accomplished, but we would never know this ministry. Second Corinthians shows us his ministry, and from his ministry, we meet the man. We see that he was an earthen vessel.</p><h2 class="head2">The Ideal Christian</h2><p>When I first became a Christian, I had my own concept of the ideal Christian, and I tried my utmost to be that kind of Christian. I thought that if only I could attain to the ideal I had conceived, then I would attain perfection. I wanted to be perfect, but I had my own ideal and standard for being a perfect Christian. I thought that if I could reach this standard, I would be perfect. I thought a perfect Christian should smile from morning to night. If he shed tears, I thought he was not victorious, but a failure. I would even say he was wrong. I thought a perfect Christian should be bold, unafraid, and courageous in every situation. If he was fearful in anything, I would say he did not have faith. I would say he was not perfect because he did not trust in the Lord. I also thought the perfect Christian was never sad. If a person was sad, I doubted that he was perfect. I could mention many other criteria, but I do not need to mention too many of these concepts to you. I believe that many of the younger brothers and sisters have ideals of what a Christian is. I am not criticizing because I used to think the same way myself.</p><h2 class="head2">Paul Was a Man</h2><p>One day I read the passage in 2 Corinthians where Paul was sorrowful. I asked, "Was Paul sorrowful?" I read that he shed many tears. I asked, "Did Paul cry?" I read that Paul suffered and was sad. I asked, "Did Paul suffer, and was he sad?" I read that he was burdened and despaired even of his life. I asked, "Did Paul despair?" As I continued reading, I saw that there were many things of which I had never thought. I had never considered that a person like Paul would have these problems. I began to realize that Christians are not another type of angel. God has not put a race of angels on the earth and said, "These are Christians." I also began to see that Paul was very close to us; he was not so far off. Paul was someone I know; he was not a stranger. I know him because I saw that he was a man.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 56: The Open Door & The Present Testimony &nbsp; pg 72</div><br></body></html>
