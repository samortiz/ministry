   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse Seven</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 7: "Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yes, amen."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although verses 5 through 7 are all exultations of the saints, verses 5 and 6 are their praises while verse 7 is their testimony toward the world following their praising of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see two matters: first, the fellowship between the saints and the Lord; second, the testimony of the saints toward the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The most joyful thing in a Christian's life is to have fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is through seeing Christ and through realizing the blessings we have in Him that we are drawn to fellowship with Him and to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of this union with God, the saints are brought to a knowledge of the future of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a part of our testimony; it is not something we pursue after day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a man studies prophecy, surely he will discover many wonderful and interesting matters, but he will hardly have a heart to fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Prophecy has its place, but to pay too much attention to it will nourish one's mind and starve one's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No matter how capable a man is in interpretation and analysis, only God's grace is able to lead us to have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only when we consider the cross of the Lord and recall how He expresses His love, washes away our sins, and puts us in a high position are we able to have a sense of gratitude which results in worship and a worship which results in fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is of course wrong for one to look down on prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This will surely put one into snares.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if the believers pay attention only to the key passages of the prophecies without touching the love of the Lord, they will not be able to worship the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, they cannot lead people to forsake the world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>True godliness is borne out of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One should first have the fellowship in the heavens before he is able to give effective testimony on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems, however, that fellowship, worship, and praise are lost skills among Christians today!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If our hearts rest in Christ and if we see in prophecy the Lord whom we love, then prophecy will provide a background to enhance our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Behold, He comes with the clouds."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do we have this kind of testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who know the Lord's coming judgment on the world will definitely make those who drift along with the world very uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, the saints will rejoice because the time of their glorification is at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The saints, because of their own joy and the world's sorrow, cry out, "Behold, He comes with the clouds."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of his earnestness in longing for our Lord Jesus Christ's glorification, John seemed to have seen the advent of the Lord already.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason he cried out, "Behold!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May the coming again of the Lord be as real in our hearts as this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"He comes."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word "He" deserves emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is no one else but He Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"This Jesus" was taken up into heaven, and later He "will come."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the testimony of the Bible Acts 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is neither the coming of the Holy Spirit, nor the destruction of Jerusalem, nor the death of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even more, it is not the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ now.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"He comes" means He Himself shall come.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Son of Man shall come.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord they love shall come.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Anything else cannot be counted as His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"He comes."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is neither His receiving of the overcoming saints before the seven years of tribulation nor His receiving of the saints to the air who have gone through the tribulation or who have been resurrected from death at His coming at the closing of the seven years of tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the coming of the Lord to the earth with His saints after the seven years of tribulation and before the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We know the overcoming believers shall be raptured to the heavens before the start of the seven years of tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Just before the seven years of tribulation end, the Lord Himself shall come from the heavens to the air to receive all the saints who will be resurrected from death or who will still be living on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Afterward, He will bring all the saints to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we want to understand prophecy, we need to differentiate these three events and not mix them together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord's rapture of the overcoming saints to the heavens is a special matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is according to the Lord's promises in Luke 21:36 and Revelation 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not all the regenerated and saved saints shall escape the tribulation on the earth unless they watch and pray always, setting their minds in the heavens while having their bodies on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The saints should not only have life, that is, be saved, but should also have the sanctified life, that is, they should overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To many saints rapture is too strange a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It involves too much of a change from their present living!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The will of the Lord is that we would possess the life of ascension now.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He wants us to have the real experience of our life being hidden with Christ in God now Col 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is nothing strange for us to have our spirit first taken up to the heavens, then our body raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Of course, in reality there will be many changes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our ascension in life is based on the accomplishment of the Lord Jesus on the cross: He joined us to Himself in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All these are related to the spiritual aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His rapturing of the saints is an ascension in their bodies as well as in their spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our spiritual problems are dealt with at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The rapture to the heavens is just a redemption of the body and not the perfection of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, those saints who are not joined to the Lord in the experience of His death, resurrection, and ascension will be left behind on the earth to suffer the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They will not be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We will speak more about this point later.</S>
