<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE WORK OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:28-29; Eph. 2:10; Gal. 1:11-12, 16; 1 Cor. 3:9-15</h1><h2 class="head1">MAN CANNOT WORK THE WORKS OF GOD</h2><p>In John 6:28 a group of people asked the Lord Jesus what they should do that they might work the works of God. They were zealous for God and wanted to do God's work. But they did not know what it was to work the works of God. They thought that once they knew what to do, they could do it. Once the question of "what to do" was settled, they thought that they could engage themselves in God's work. The question of whether or not they could actually do the work was not part of their consideration at all; they only needed to know what to do. Here we see man's desire to participate in God's work. He feels that he can work God's work; he thinks that his ability is great enough to take up God's work.</p><p>But the Lord's answer was entirely different from man's question. The Lord said, "This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He has sent" (v. 29). While man boasted of what he could do, the Lord replied that man ought to believe. Man's trying to do something means that he wants to prove his ability; man's believing means that he acknowledges his inability to do anything. Believing is receiving (John 1:12), and believing into the One whom God sent means believing into the Lord Jesus. There is no question of human merit or human ability. Man cannot do anything; God has done it all. All that man needs to do is receive, stretch out his hand, and take in the Son of God. Faith signifies that God has done all the work; He has given us His only begotten Son. There is no need for man to do anything; all he has to do is accept what God has done.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING WORKED</h2><p>Following this the Lord said, "This is the work of God." The ignorant ones thought that they could work the works of God. They were zealous and trying to do something for God. But the Lord told them that the work of God is to believe into Him whom God has sent. This is the work of God. It is not what man has done for God but what God has done Himself. It is the work of God and not the work of man. For man to believe in the Lord Jesus is a work of God; it is not something that man does but something that God does. God's work can only be done by God alone. Man cannot work God's work; he has no part in God's work.</p><p>Consider the story of Martha and Mary. It serves as a good illustration of our point. Martha was busily serving the Lord. She did a great deal of work and was so busy that she asked the Lord to send her sister over to help her. Perhaps she thought that by expending so much effort, paying such a price, and suffering so much hardship she would be considered as having served the Lord and having done some work for Him. Yet the Lord did not praise her. Instead He said, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; but there is need of one thing, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her" (Luke 10:41-42).</p><p>What had Mary done? The Bible says that Mary sat at the feet of Jesus and listened to His word. Sitting and listening do not constitute a work at all. She was not as busy as her sister; she was quietly sitting at the Lord's feet and drawing near to Him. Listening to His word is receiving His word. The Lord's word is spirit and life, and He dispenses life to men through His word. Mary was receiving the Lord's word and affording Him the opportunity to operate on her. She was giving the Lord the opportunity to dispense Himself into her through the word. Mary was just a receiving vessel. The One doing the work was the Lord, not Mary. She, the person, was the work of the Lord; she was the object of the Lord's work. Ephesians 2:10 says, "We are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works." Thank the Lord that we are not the work of man but the work of God. God's work is fully trustworthy. Oh, what a glorious fact that we are the work of God!</p>
