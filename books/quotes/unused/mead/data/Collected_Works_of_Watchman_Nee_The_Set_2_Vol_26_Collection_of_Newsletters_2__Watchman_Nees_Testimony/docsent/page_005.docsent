   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings to the faithful bondslave of God,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the brother whom I miss, Mr. Watchman Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Last year I received a letter from Yi Lin mentioning the need for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I also heard about the publication of Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am very much in favor of it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A few days ago, I received the fourth issue of Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have not received the first three issues.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I really thank the Lord that I was among those who attended the recent Overcomer Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was enlightened by God during the meetings, so that my spirit sprouted new life and I learned something of His truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was very joyful to be able to fellowship with the brothers in the Lord in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although this was my first meeting with you, it was a great blessing in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now that I have returned home from Shanghai, I cannot forget what happened there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please allow me to tell you something of my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since I left the denominations at the start of the year, two years ago, I believe that I have received God's grace and received His sweetness in my living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I began to meet in the Lord's name in my home.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There were more than twenty people in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not long after we had established the Lord's table meeting, we met with some experiences of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I will not go into detail.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan took the opportunity to work much in my home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was something like the situation in Matthew 10:35-36.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This occurred because I was weak and could not govern my own house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How can I govern the house of God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, I ask you to pray for me that I would overcome all the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is my greatest hope.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unfortunately, the first time we met, we did not have the opportunity to communicate freely, so I am writing this letter to you in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I also hope that the second time we see each other, my joy will be full.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If this letter can be used in Collection of Newsletters, please feel free to edit and correct it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Otherwise, you can discard it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are other things I want to tell you, but I will do it next time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Peace!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May the Lord bless you!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A LETTER FROM BROTHER CHANG YU CHIH,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>CHIA HSING, CHEKIANG</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother Lee:</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I received your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It comforted and encouraged me very much because I was struggling, wanting the Lord to give me a meeting while at the same time feeling in my deepest part that I should wait for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your word to pray and be patient caused me to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The principal here is also a good brother in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He wants me to bear the responsibility for preaching the gospel with another brother, Lo Yung Tien.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The school meets together for a short time to have so-called morning devotions every Friday and Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The principal wants us to preach the gospel to the students during this time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we feel that this is a good opportunity, we feel a great pressure, as if we cannot bear this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are praying that the Lord would give grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If it is His will, we would be willing for you to come to preach the gospel for a few days at our school.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are willing to come, please tell us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is not a table meeting in this locality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are willing to watch the Lord Himself lead His flock step by step in Chia Hsing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"It is sufficient to have the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Last Lord's Day I got dysentery and stayed in the hospital to rest for five days.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am completely well now.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord's keeping power got me safely through.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Until we meet again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
