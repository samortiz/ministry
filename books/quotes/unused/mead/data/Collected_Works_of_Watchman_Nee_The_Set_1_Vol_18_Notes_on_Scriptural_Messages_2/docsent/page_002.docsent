   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MARY Issue No. 28 Scripture Reading: John 20:1-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead, He manifested Himself to many people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus manifested Himself first to Mary the Magdalene.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord was eager to manifest Himself to Peter because Peter was in the midst of weakness, but He was more eager to manifest Himself to Mary the Magdalene.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was eager to manifest Himself to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus because they were heading in the wrong direction, but He was more eager to manifest Himself to Mary the Magdalene.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was eager to manifest Himself to John because John was the one He loved, but He was more eager to manifest Himself to Mary the Magdalene.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was eager to manifest Himself to Thomas because Thomas did not believe His resurrection, but He was more eager to manifest Himself to Mary the Magdalene.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There were other disciples to whom the Lord was eager to manifest Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the Lord did not manifest Himself to them first.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He manifested Himself first to Mary the Magdalene.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why did the Lord manifest Himself first to Mary the Magdalene before Peter, John, Thomas, the other disciples, and the people?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Mary the Magdalene was the last one to leave the site of the cross; she was the first one to come to the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Besides Mary the Magdalene, many others were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Besides Mary the Magdalene, many others had demons cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But only Mary the Magdalene came early in the morning to the tomb to seek the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no doubt that she did not understand many things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some may even have thought that she did not have a good mind; but she received the best portion, a portion which we may not have.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Her better portion was her love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every Christian should desire and pursue after this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 1:29 says that when John the Baptist saw Jesus coming to him, he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John the Baptist said this when he saw the Lord for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 36 John saw the Lord Jesus again and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John did not say "who takes away the sin of the world" the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Had he forgotten?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No. This is the experience of a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When a person sees the Lord for the first time, he thinks about himself as well as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He thinks of the Lord as the Lamb of God who takes away his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he sees the Lord for the second time, he forgets about himself and sees only the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first time, he thanks Him because of the grace He gives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second time, he draws near to Him because of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our baptism is our union with the Lord, while the breaking of bread is our remembrance of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, we become the Lord's believers; then we become His lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, we believe in the Lord's work; then we are drawn to the Lord's person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many of us only know the preciousness of the Lord's work, but not the preciousness of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We only know the grace we have received, but not the loveliness of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The difference between Mary the Magdalene and the others was that she not only appreciated salvation, she also treasured the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Oh, many people had their demons cast out by the Lord, but only Mary the Magdalene sought after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although other women came to seek the Lord, the very first one to come to the tomb was Mary the Magdalene.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the first day of the week, early in the morning while it was still dark, she came to the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She did not care for anything; she came to seek the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A brother once said something very good about this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He said, "Since the Lord Jesus died, the world in the eyes of Mary had become nothing but a void!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The whole world could not draw Mary's heart, because One had already taken her heart away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mary's heart was a heart completely occupied by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Mary's heart was a heart captured by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Oh, the heart of Mary the Magdalene was seized by the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Mary came to the tomb, what did she see?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What did she do?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She thought, "My beloved Lord has died.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today all I want is to have a look at His body."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, the body was gone!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She could only run to Peter and John and say to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Peter and the other disciple, John, then went to the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Stooping down and looking in, he saw the linen cloths; yet he did not go in. Simon Peter followed him, went into the tomb, and saw the linen cloths; the handkerchief that had been over His head was not lying with the linen cloths, but was folded up in one place apart.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the other disciple went in, saw, and believed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After the two disciples saw this, what did they do?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible says, "The disciples therefore went away again to their own home."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They still had a home in the world which they regarded as their best.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They still had a home.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although they found that the Lord was not there, they did not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They felt that going back to their own home was the most important thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Besides the Lord, they still had a place to go.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What did Mary do?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"But Mary stood outside at the tomb weeping."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She had nowhere to go!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>She could not go away!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How profound is the word "but!"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Mary thought in her heart, "You have a home to which you can go, but I cannot because the Lord is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You think that the disappearance of the Lord is not important, but I cannot feel the same.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Who has taken Him away?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How can I leave?"</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>She stood outside of the tomb weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In her eyes the world had become a void!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What else could she do?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>She could not do anything but stand outside of the tomb and weep.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Oh, Mary's heart was a widow's heart!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The disciples who followed after the Lord went away.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The disciples who had some knowledge went away.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>John, who loved the Lord, went away.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Peter, who was so bold, went away.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But Mary, a simple woman out of whom the Lord had driven seven demons, was caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>She had no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>She had no comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>She could not go away.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Lord was not there; everything was over.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Her heart was missing something.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Her heart was empty; therefore, she could only weep.</S>
