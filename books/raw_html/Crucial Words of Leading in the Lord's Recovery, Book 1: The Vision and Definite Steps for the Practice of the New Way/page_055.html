<h2 class="head1">THE ONLY WAY<br />
BEING TO LABOR DILIGENTLY</h2>
<p>Although such a practice is not a burden, it requires much labor. In farming, for example, one must work with his two hands. Removing stones, digging, plowing, tunneling, and irrigation require one to work with his two hands. Every day the farmer needs to do some work. When I was young, the older generation told me, &ldquo;The size of the harvest depends not only on the land but also on the hand.&rdquo; Even when we were snowbound in winter and no one could work in the fields, we were not idle at home. The entire family worked in preparation for the spring. The Chinese divide the year into twenty-four &ldquo;seasons&rdquo; with certain tasks for each season. This reflects the cumulative experience of their labor throughout the centuries.</p>
<p>Today we are in the scientific age. Everything is done by machines, yet labor is still necessary. Science and machinery can reduce only the work but not the labor. If the owner of a business does not labor day and night, he cannot compete with others and cannot make money. If we are managers but work only as much as our employees do&mdash;eight hours a day for five and a half days a week&mdash;our business will soon shut down. There is only one way to succeed&mdash;laboring and endeavoring with all of our time.</p>
<p>We must not think that the Jews are much more capable than others. Their success lies not in their capability but in their endeavoring spirit. In New York there are more than three million Jews. They have become what they are through their hard labor. While others work eight hours a day, some of them work more than ten hours a day. A Jewish friend of mine told me these things. Now some of the Chinese are taking this same way in the United States; they give themselves to work, and they are making progress quickly. Some Chinese were not this way when they were in their home country, but once they migrated to the United States, they realized that the circumstances did not allow them to relax anymore. When they relax, others move ahead of them. Today many Chinese students are ranked at the top not only at the college level but also at the high school level. They are forced into such achievements by their circumstances.</p>
<p>Many times I have considered before the Lord how to present this matter to the brothers and sisters. I have considered how to convince all the saints to labor diligently and practically. To be sure, if we take this way, the churches in Taiwan will have a breakthrough. I cannot pray, &ldquo;Lord, grant all the saints sufferings and persecutions so that they will be forced to strive and labor.&rdquo; I can only exhort and bother everyone patiently. We must take the actual steps one by one. Do not try to take any shortcuts. Do not try to be quick, and do not expect too much. Never think that as long as the elders come together to fast and pray for a week, the church will have a great revival. This will not work. Do not take this way. Of course, we need to pray, and I hope that the elders would spend more time praying. But I also would like to see us spending the time every day to work while we pray. Do not merely tell the brothers and sisters to work; we have to work ourselves, and we should bring others into the work and labor with them side by side.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING WITH GOD<br />
TO WORK ON THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>I hope that the co-workers will labor in the same way. I have been a co-worker for many years. I know what you are thinking. Every worker desires to have power and a gift. He likes to see dozens, even hundreds, listening to his preaching. However, today we must go to every home. We need to visit the weak, strengthen the sick, and recover the dormant ones. Is this beneath you? This is not beneath us. This is what the co-workers should be doing in the first place. There are all manner of burdens upon me that prevent me from doing this, but if I were not so burdened, I would happily engage in this work and contact the saints one by one. I hope that from today onward, the co-workers would not crave the big meetings but would love the home meetings. Do not despise the home meetings. Their results last forever, and they increase and multiply. Perhaps we serve one home today. When the relatives of this home are touched, we may end up with a fivefold multiplication. This is the genuine way for the church to increase and spread.</p>
<p>In the past we spoke, shouted, and labored from the podium for many years. What was the result? Every so-called Christian worker has the secret desire of becoming a spiritual giant. Even if a co-worker among us cannot be a Peter, one who now is dead and gone, he at least wants to be a Billy Graham or a Witness Lee. This is a terrible thought. The young brothers and sisters among us should not have this concept. This will kill our spiritual life. We should not have this kind of concept. I have said before that when I first began to serve the Lord, I did not dream of any great success. I was ready to take my Bible to all the villages and hamlets to preach the gospel, drinking from the mountain streams and filling my hunger with roots and the bark of trees. I hope that we will have a right motive, a clean heart, and a proper spirit. Even if we have a doctorate degree, we should still serve the Lord in this way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PATTERN OF THE MISSIONARIES</h2>
<p>Since my youth I have admired the missionaries very much. In my hometown the missionaries were all highly educated scholars. They came from England and the United States. Many of them were more than sixty years of age, yet they still had a spirit of sacrifice, a willingness to suffer, and a heart to give up everything. I was very touched by them. Even though every one of them was a scholar in his own field, they were all willing to go to a backward country like China to preach the gospel and contact people in the rural countryside. One of the most elderly among them was Mr. Go. He was ninety years of age, but he nonetheless went to the streets to contact people. He also gave away a great deal of money to the poor and used this as a means to contact people. His work was very effective. When the Boxer Rebellion broke out in 1900, the unbelievers called the missionaries the &ldquo;First Devils&rdquo; and the Chinese Christians the &ldquo;Second Devils.&rdquo; At the height of the rebellion, the unbelievers had a slogan: &ldquo;Among the Second Devils spare Chao Tu-nan; among the First Devils spare Mr. Go.&rdquo; Why did they say this? These two were especially kind to people. I saw all these things with my own eyes, and I have to admit that they produced a deep impression on me.</p>
