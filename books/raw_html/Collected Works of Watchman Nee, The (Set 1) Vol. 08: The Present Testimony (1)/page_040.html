<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXTENT<br>OF THE BELIEVER'S SALVATION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 15</H2><P>We all know that we are sinners and that we have eternal life through faith. Today we want to see to what extent God saves us through Jesus Christ. In other words, to what extent will our person be saved by God through Jesus Christ?</P><P>In the last two or three years, I have noticed one thing: I have felt that there is definitely something wrong with my personal Christian life. When I read the Bible, I confess that I do not have what the Bible says. Although the Christian life of some seems to be worse than mine, and although some who have deeper experiences have answered my questions by saying that I have already attained, I still feel that I do not have what the Bible says. Thank God! Now I know! Indeed there are better things in Christ. Indeed these better things can be obtained and can be obtained even now.</P><P>So, today what I want to talk about is the extent of our heritage in Christ Jesus. This is not about the future heritage in heaven—something which we will have in the future. We are not talking about eternal life—something which we have through regeneration. We are not talking about the glory in the kingdom—something which will be ours in the millennium to come. Rather, we want to emphasize the extent to which God can save us as persons today.</P><P>Let us read some verses in the Bible. We will read them one by one as we move along. We want to see the extent to which God can save us today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CONSCIENCE</H2><P>Hebrews 9:14 says, "How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" This verse speaks of the extent to which Christ saves our conscience. His blood can purge our conscience from dead works.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! Please ask yourselves today if there are still accusations in your conscience. If from time to time there are still accusations in your conscience, then what you have obtained is not yet complete. The Lord saves us, and His blood purges our conscience. Our conscience can be purified by His blood from every kind of self-accusation. When we gather together, we pray, "O God! We thank You that our hearts have been sprinkled from an evil conscience." But many times we still feel uneasy. What we have done is just a cover-up and a mental gloss-over. But the blood of God's Son does purify. If your conscience still accuses you, it does not mean that God's salvation cannot save you to that extent. It merely means that the salvation which you have received is not yet complete. Thank and praise God! He can save us to such an extent! It is possible for our conscience to be purified.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. HEART</H2><P>Mark 7:21-23 says, "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil reasonings, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, foolishness. All these wicked things proceed from within and defile the man." Also Matthew 5:8 says, "Blessed are the pure in heart." These two verses speak of the original defiled condition of our heart. They also tell us how Christ can save our heart to the extent of being pure.</P><P>Brothers and sisters! The heart mentioned in Mark is our natural heart. What about this heart? The Lord said that all evil things come from men's heart. All these evils are from the heart. But the Lord said, "Blessed are the pure in heart." The Lord is able to save such a bad heart to the extent of being pure.</P><P>The salvation of our heart does not mean the suppression of the inward evils so that they do not break loose. The salvation of our heart means that our heart is cleansed from within. If we plan to cover up or seal up, this is not salvation, because we have not been saved by God to the extent of being pure. We have to ask God, "How many evil thoughts are there in my heart? How much deceit? How much jealousy? How much pride?" If all these are merely suppressed inside us and we are merely covering them up tightly, our heart has not been saved. What God says is, "Blessed are the pure in heart!"</P><P>Today our shortcomings, problems, and lack of testimony are due to the fact that our heart has not been cleansed to that extent. Many times we see someone sin, but we dare not reproach him, because we realize that this person's outward condition is but the blossoming of sin; the seed of this blossom is also in his heart. Although we do not love the world like some, our hearts are nevertheless affected. We are no different from others. When we do not have a pure heart, we do not have a testimony.</P><P>God would not leave any filthiness in our heart. Even a heart that is as evil as the one mentioned in Mark can be saved by God to the extent of being clean. God can save us until we have a pure heart. We praise and thank God that He can save us to such an extent! He can deliver such an evil heart to become a pure heart.</P>
