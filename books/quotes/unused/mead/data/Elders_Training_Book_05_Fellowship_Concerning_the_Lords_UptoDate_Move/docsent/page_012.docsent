   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ADVANCING IN THE DEEPER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HIGHER TRUTHS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The brothers who are going out as the gospel team in these days have set up a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These brothers are going out, not to preach a shallow gospel, but rather to preach the higher gospel, even to preach the Triune God to people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The entire situation of Christians has remained in shallowness for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To continue in that is easy, but for us to go out to preach the gospel with the deeper truths is somewhat of an uphill battle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The shallow things could never stir up people s attention.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Especially in such a leading country as this, people are tired of listening to the old shallow things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Due to this, many preachers tried their best to create stories and illustrations to stir up people s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, not much reality of the bequests of the New Testament is preached as the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But now, the brothers going out have preached the riches of the bequests of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is no wonder that so many love to hear this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thank the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What I desire to see is not just some brothers going out as a team to preach these deeper things, but that all the elders would rise up to learn the deeper things and to teach the deeper things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I assure you, you will see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You will labor less and reap more.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you sow the rich seed, your harvest surely will be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you sow the poor seed, regardless of how much you labor, the harvest eventually will not be that rich because what you sow is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not take the easy way or go the short-cut way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is wise to take the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today in the Lord s recovery the proper way is to care for these deeper truths.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The deeper truths in 1 Corinthians do not include Christ as our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These items are all mentioned in chapter one of 1 Corinthians v. 30 . In chapter two Paul speaks of the depths of God v. 10 . Surely in the following chapters there are things deeper than righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For instance, 6:17 tells us that we can be joined to the Lord as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How deep this is!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Years ago I read quite a few books on Christ being our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Probably even in the first year after being born again, I read books of this kind, but I never read a book telling people that they could be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then in chapter seven Paul said, I give my opinion v. 25 . It seems this is very shallow, yet in this chapter a deeper truth is conveyed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even in giving his opinion, eventually in the last verse of the chapter he said, I think that I also have the Spirit of God v. 40 . Could you explain the truth that is here? How could giving one s opinion be having the Spirit of God? This is a deeper truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even the headship taught in chapter eleven is much deeper than righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Could you explain how God is the head of Christ, Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman 11:3 ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is also a deeper truth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This book of deeper truths also contains a lot of shallow things such as lawsuits, fornication, and idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I read books concerning these things, but very few books have come out that tell us all these deeper things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In chapter ten is the table of the Lord and in chapter eleven is the Lord s supper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is a difference between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How could you have the fellowship of the blood of Christ by taking the cup of wine?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How could you have the very fellowship with all the saints by partaking of the bread?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is much deeper than Christ being our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, going on further, you have the deeper truth concerning Christ becoming a life-giving Spirit 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who understands this?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Who today is teaching that we can live in resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, because the Christians lack a view of the deeper truths, they interpreted chapters twelve and fourteen in a very shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you have the view of the deeper truths, you can see that what Paul is talking about in these two chapters is not that shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Could you tell me what the difference is between the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge 12:8 ?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These are the first two aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The two highest aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit are the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The third one is faith, the fourth is healing, the fifth is miracles or works of power, the next is the discernment of spirits, and the last are tongues and their interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first two are the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge, and the last two are tongues and interpretation of tongues 12:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Could you explain why Paul put tongues and interpretation of tongues as the last two items and why he exalted the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge to be on the top?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To speak in tongues is a shallow thing, but to give a word of wisdom or a word of knowledge is much deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of course, this knowledge is not the knowledge of science or of politics, but the knowledge of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To speak the word of wisdom you need a lot of experience of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is why we may be able to speak in tongues and practice so-called healings, but we cannot speak the word of wisdom or the word of knowledge because this is much higher and much deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is easy to be an elementary student in kindergarten, but to be one in graduate school is not that easy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To speak the word of wisdom and to speak the word of knowledge is like being in graduate school.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The word of wisdom is the word concerning Christ as the deeper things of God predestined by God for our portion 1:24, 30; 2:6-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The word of knowledge is the word that imparts a general knowledge of things concerning God and the Lord 8:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The word of wisdom is mainly of our spirit through revelation; the word of knowledge is mainly of our understanding through teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The former is deeper than the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, both of them, not the speaking in tongues nor any other miraculous gift, are listed as the first and topmost aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit because both are the most profitable ministries or services for the edification of the saints and the building up of the church to carry out God s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul says, Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation v. 26 . In chapters twelve and fourteen Paul was trying his best to uplift the Corinthians from their low estate to a higher one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Corinthians were too low and too shallow 3:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In these days, in the Lord s recovery, we should try to leave our kindergarten state.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Why would we not go further and higher?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We surely need to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The problem with the Corinthians was the same as that with the Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In Hebrews, as I mentioned already, Paul says clearly that we need to advance, to leave the word of the beginning of the Christ Heb 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to the entire book of Hebrews, the word of the beginning of the Christ concerns Christ s earthly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Though we may consider His conception or His incarnation so deep, Paul says that is something at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You have to go higher from the earth to the heavens, from the good word of God to the word of righteousness, from the word as milk to the word as solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Paul says clearly that milk is for babes and that solid food is for the mature ones Heb 5:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whether we are the babes or the mature ones depends upon what kind of food we take.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you still take milk you are just a babe.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Are we still in that stage, not able to take any solid food?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should have left that stage already.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, we must advance.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Learn of the brothers on the gospel team to forsake the shallow gospel and learn to preach the high gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When I was giving messages on the river crossers in the Hebrews training I said that today there is a need for a group of people to go out to preach these things recorded in Hebrews as the high gospel Life-study of Hebrews, pp.154-157 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Paul said that he was commissioned to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel to the Gentiles Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He did not preach the shallow things concerning heaven and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He preached the unsearchable riches of Christ not only as truths to the believers, but as the gospel to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>LET US GO ON</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Brothers, this is my burden let us go on.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>W. H. Griffith Thomas published a book on Hebrews with the title Let Us Go On, and Andrew Murray published a book on Hebrews entitled The Holy of Holies . My burden is just to fellowship with you and beg you to go on, not just from the outer court to the Holy Place but even from the Holy Place to the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Let us go on.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In our ordinary, regular meetings all these deeper things should be taught, not the shallow things.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Since 1962 some have mostly been remaining for twenty-three years in the same things.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Merely to be teaching people the things around the altar, the cross of Christ, is still too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We need to go on to the deeper truths of our very God who is Triune, to get into His foremost and highest attribute, that is, His divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>His divine Trinity is much higher than His power, His love, or even His life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We need to learn of His Trinity, the Godhead, how the Father is embodied in the Son, how the Son is realized as the Spirit, and how such a Spirit is the realization of the Son and also the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We need to learn these things not only for our knowledge but also for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If you would enjoy this benediction, surely you must know the divine Trinity, the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Christians today are shallow because they would not pay the price to labor adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>These riches are all here in the Bible, just like gold in a mine, but nearly no one would labor to dig them out.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Just to buy a few pieces of gold is not our job.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Our job is to dig the gold mine.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We are to do the mining work.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I hope, brothers, that in your localities you would not repeat the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We should learn to go on, to learn the things in the heavenlies, and to learn to speak these higher and deeper things.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The book of Revelation, for example, has never been opened up to the Lord s children as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is now an absolutely transparent book to us.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>All the points have been covered in the Life-study Messages and the footnotes of the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If you want to know them, you can go to the printed pages and you will get them.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This will require your time.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>To dig out the gold is not that easy.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I would encourage all of us to go on in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Otherwise, the Lord would not have much of a way to go on; we will delay Him, retain Him, hold Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Some of us even repeat the things we taught twenty-three years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>What we are teaching holds people back.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>In education if you hold even a problem student in the same grade for a couple of years, he will be spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>You even have to encourage the problem student to go to the next grade.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We should go further.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Let us go on.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>There is real hope for us to go on in His recovery.</S>
