<h2 class=head2>Bringing God’s Kingdom to Earth</h2><p>When He comes again, He will also bring God’s kingdom to the earth. According to Daniel 2, He will come as a smiting stone to smash and destroy the entire human government on this earth. Then as the smiting stone, He will become a great mountain, the kingdom of God, filling the whole earth (vv. 34-35, 44-45). Thus, in His second coming He will consummate God’s new creation in us, and He will clear up the earth by destroying the entire human government from Nimrod to Antichrist, signified by the great human image in Daniel 2. Then He will become the kingdom of God filling the whole earth.<p>All the overcoming believers will reign with Him in the thousand-year kingdom, while the defeated believers will suffer some discipline. The defeated Christians in this age will be made mature in the millennium, and the saved Jews will also be consummated as God’s new creation. After the millennium is completed, a part of the nations, who were the citizens in the kingdom of one thousand years, will rebel (Rev. 20:7-9). That will be the last rebellion of mankind against God. Fire will come down out of heaven and consume them. Later, the old heaven and old earth will pass away to become the new heaven and new earth. All the consummated believers and chosen and redeemed Jews will be together to be the New Jerusalem for eternity.<h2 class=head2>Being the Centrality and Universality of the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Christ will be the centrality and universality of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be the mingling, the blending, of the processed Triune God with the transformed, tripartite man. On the one hand, we will be God’s dwelling, and on the other hand, God will be our abode. The New Jerusalem will be a mutual abiding place for God and for us. In other words, God will dwell in us, and we will abide in Him. We will enjoy and express the Triune God forever. This is the eternal destiny of the New Jerusalem with Christ as the center and the circumference. He will become the centrality and the universality of God’s economy in full. The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of God’s economy. This is the biography of Christ without any ending.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Now we want to fellowship concerning the third emphasis in the Lord’s recovery—the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Divine Trinity</h2><p>When we speak concerning the Spirit, we are touching the Divine Trinity. The Divine Trinity is a great mystery. God is uniquely one, but this one God is triune. In theology, scholars of the Bible invented the word triune. This word comes from Latin. Tri means three; une means one. God is one, yet He is three. Although God is three, He is not three gods. He is the only one God, yet He is three. This is a great mystery.<p>Bible teachers and theologians have tried their best to describe the Trinity. They have used the term persons to describe the three of the Godhead. We may use this term temporarily, but if this term is pressed too far, it can lead to the heresy of tritheism. Others have used the word hypostases to describe the three of the Godhead. Hypostases refers to supporting substances or to something substantial supporting something underneath. This is like a stand having four legs to support it. God is uniquely one, but He has three supporting substances—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
