Compared to God, man is simple; hence, the way that the Bible was written is also simple. In particular, the Bible presents the divine and mystical matters in a way that is easily understandable to us. For this reason, the Bible seems to contain some “bark” and “branches.” In their reading of the Bible, many Christians often touch only these superficial things. They do not penetrate the Bible to touch its kernel. They do not touch the spirit and life in the depths of the Bible nor know the real, crucial elements in it. We must go beyond the superficial branches and bark and enter into the depths of the Bible in order to touch its spirit, its kernel, and to know its crucial elements.<p>A nut consists of a shell, the meat, and the kernel, which is the center. Man is also of three parts: the outer part—the physical organs; the inner part—the soul; and the innermost part—the spirit (1 Thes. 5:23). Of these three parts—spirit, soul, and body—the most important part is the innermost part, the spirit, which is the breath of life in man (Gen. 2:7). Without such a breath of life, it is not possible for man to exist, and man thus ceases to be man. Likewise, the Bible has its kernel, its life, its center, which is constituted with the church, Christ, the Spirit, and life. These four items are the contents of the true substance of the Bible. The revelation of the Bible, particularly the New Testament, stresses these four matters: the church, Christ, the Spirit, and life. If we remove these four items from the New Testament, all that remains would merely be dead letters. These four crucial elements are also the four important items in the Lord’s recovery today. Hence, we must all have a deep impression, a fresh light, and a renewed understanding concerning these four crucial elements.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH—THE EMPHASIS BEING THAT THE BELIEVERS ARE ON THE GROUND OF ONENESS TO BE THE TESTIMONY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>The First Significance of the Church Being People Called Out by God</h2><p>The first crucial element of the Bible is the church. The Greek word for church is ekklesia, which is composed of two words: ek, meaning “out of,” and kaleo, meaning “call.” Hence, in Greek, the word for church means the called-out ones. The early translators of the Chinese Bible rendered this word as a religious assembly. This term fits man’s natural thought, but it spoils the original meaning. Ekklesia does not denote a religious assembly; it refers to a called-out congregation. Therefore, the most precise rendering is assembly. We are a group of people called out by God; we are the church.
