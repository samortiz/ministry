   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL 2 Date: August 24, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kuling THE NEED FOR A SINNER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO TURN HIS HEART TO THE LORD Paying Attention to What Sinners Should Do</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The subject of our discussion this time is how the gospel is accomplished in the sinner, rather than how God accomplishes His work through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once we are clear how the gospel is accomplished in the sinner, we will know how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a sinner has a subjective grasp of how he is saved at the time he receives the gospel, he will know how to convey the same gospel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many times when we preach the gospel, we do not know what sinners need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the reason we waste so much time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are two basic truths with regard to preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first is the work of God which He has accomplished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's work in Christ consists of His sending the Lord Jesus to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By shedding His blood and dying on the cross, Christ redeemed us from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God raised up the Lord Jesus because He satisfied God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a basic truth in the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, this is a very important truth, but as far as the sinner is concerned, this truth is a past act.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A sinner must do something else before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, there is a second step: God must send His Spirit to man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God transmits the past work of Christ to us by sending the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This also is a basic truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the Spirit does not come, we cannot be saved even though the Lord Jesus has accomplished redemption and God is ready to receive us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without the Holy Spirit, the work of the Lord Jesus is objective; it cannot be subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is outside of us; it cannot be ours inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It belongs to God alone and cannot be ours as well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The coming of the Holy Spirit applies Christ's accomplished work to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The question now is: What should the sinner do?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus has finished His work, and the Holy Spirit is waiting to operate in the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How then can the sinner be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Among gospel preachers, some emphasize repentance, while others emphasize faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Still others emphasize confession.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What should a sinner do before he can be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what we have to find out today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Gospel preachers today are subconsciously affected by their own theology in their preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They lay up in store three things for the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first is a collection of gospel truths.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The second is a mixture of exhortations on the vanity of the world and the evil of sins, etc. The third is some demand for actions, such as repentance, confession, prayer, believing, or baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Most gospel preachers today are well equipped in these few categories of things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is their basic arsenal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They first try to help people to understand a collection of gospel truths.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then they lead them to take some action, thinking that a man will be saved by taking these actions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But is this practice biblical at all?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What does the Bible teach concerning the preaching of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to point out a few examples from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the New Testament, we find many people believing in the Lord and being saved; we find this in the Gospels and in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But how did the Lord Jesus and the apostles lead these ones to salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From their pattern, we can learn how we should preach the gospel to sinners, and how wrong our ways are today.</S>
