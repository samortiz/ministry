We need to consider why the apostle Paul said this. When he wrote 2 Corinthians, the Corinthian believers were doubting his apostolic authority. Some even claimed that he was an insincere, fickle person, a man of yes and no. This is why he told them that the Christ he preached to them was always yes (1:19-20). Then he told the Corinthians that he was a real priest in the priesthood who had been anointed by God. In ancient times no one could assume the position and function of a priest unless he had been anointed. Paul said that he was anointed and attached to the Head of the priesthood, Christ, the anointed One.</P><P>After the compounding of the ointment in Exodus 30, God told Moses to anoint all the parts of the tabernacle and Aaron and his sons (vv. 26-30). Aaron became the anointed one, and all his sons were attached to him. Then all his sons were anointed. The apostle Paul used this background to indicate to the Corinthians that today Christ is our real Aaron. He is the High Priest, and we are His sons. God has attached us to Him, and God has anointed us. We are assuming the position and function of priests because we have been attached to Christ, the anointed One.</P><P>God has anointed and appointed Christ to be the Head of the priesthood, and we all have been attached to Him. Thus, we are the sons of the real Aaron today. We have become the priests of the divine priesthood because we have been attached to the Head Priest, and we have been anointed by God. Paul's proof of his apostleship was the anointing. He was attached to Christ, the anointed One, and he was anointed by God. When the priests were anointed, they were consecrated and commissioned.</P><P>This ointment became Paul's seal, sealing him to assume his priestly position. The Spirit sealed him with everything of Christ's person, work, and attainments. These elements of Christ upon him were his seal to prove that he was anointed by God to serve Him as a priest. Furthermore, this anointing and sealing became a foretaste to Paul. No matter what the Corinthians thought of Paul, he testified that he was enjoying the Spirit as a foretaste. The anointing and the sealing brought him the divine element for him to enjoy.</P><P>I want to say again that what we need today is not doctrinal teaching, but the heavenly anointing with the heavenly ointment. We are consecrated, commissioned, ordained, and inaugurated into our priesthood by being anointed. The anointing is the painting of all that Christ is, all that He has done, and all that He has attained into our being. We have been firmly attached to God's anointed One, and we have been anointed. This anointing is the sealing, and this seal becomes the foretaste, the pledge, for our enjoyment.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> </body></html>
