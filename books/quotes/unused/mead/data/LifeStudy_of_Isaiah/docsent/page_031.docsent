   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Response of Isaiah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Isaiah 6:5 we have the response of Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Realizing That He Was Finished</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaiah responded to the vision of Christ in glory by saying, "Woe is me, for I am finished!" v. 5a . As a result of seeing this vision, Isaiah was terminated, finished.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Realizing That He Was a Man</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>of Unclean Lips and That in the Midst</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>of a People of Unclean Lips He Dwelt</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isaiah went on to say, "For I am a man of unclean lips, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell" v. 5b . By this we can see that we must pay attention to our lips, to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every day we talk too much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A great percentage of the words we speak are evil, because most of our words are words of criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nearly every word that we speak concerning any matter or any person is a word of criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason that our lips are unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Unclean things such as gossip, murmuring, and reasoning make the church life taste like vinegar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we eliminate gossip, murmuring, and reasoning, we may find that we have very little to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Like Isaiah, we need to realize that our lips are unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone who truly sees a vision of the Lord is enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The vision he sees immediately exposes him and brings him into light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Peter saw the Lord in Luke 5, he immediately said to the Lord, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord!" v. 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How much we realize concerning ourselves depends on how much we see the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason, we need a revival every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The morning revival is the time for us to see the Lord again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we see the Lord, the more we see what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We realize that there is nothing good within us and that everything within us is without splendor or virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Knowing That He Had Seen the King,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jehovah of Hosts, with His Eyes</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although Isaiah knew that he was finished and that he was a man of unclean lips, he nevertheless knew that he had seen the King, Jehovah of hosts, with his eyes Isa 6:5c .</S>
