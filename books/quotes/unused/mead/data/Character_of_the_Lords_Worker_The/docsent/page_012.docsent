   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Man is worthy of our love.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All sins can be forgiven; we can sympathize with all weaknesses and activities of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are sinners, and we know what sinners are like.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yet, at the same time, we know that man is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brothers and sisters, the Lord did not die for men because there was a great number of them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said that the Good Shepherd forsook all to seek one lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not come to seek to save the lost sheep because there were ninety-nine of them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Good Shepherd came for one lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, even if only one person in the whole world were lost, the Lord would still have come to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, historically, all men needed to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But as far as the love in His heart is concerned, He was ready to come for one man, for one lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit did not begin searching because ten coins were lost; He searched because one coin was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Father did not wait for His prodigal because all of His sons had become prodigal; He opened His arms to one prodigal who returned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the parables in Luke 15, we see that in His work of redemption, the Lord was willing to spend Himself freely to meet the need of even one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not wait for the needs of many to arise before He would work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows us the intense love that the Lord has for man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brothers and sisters, if we want to serve the Lord in a proper way, we have to cultivate an interest in man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we cannot cultivate this interest, we will not be able to do much.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if we do something, our work will be very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we are limited as a person, we will not have the capacity to embrace many people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will not fathom the full significance of redemption until we become interested in man and our hearts are enlarged to see his worth in God's eyes and in His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without this, it is vain for puny creatures such as we to try to have a share in the great work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How can anyone be used to save souls if they do not love souls?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can anyone try to save man without loving man?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If this fundamental lack of love for men is removed, many other difficulties in relation to men will vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We think that some people are too ignorant and others are too hard, but these problems should not stop us from loving them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is love, there will not be any disdain for man, and God will bring us to the point that we take our place as men among our fellow men.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When some Christian workers in urban areas go out into the country to work among farmers, they have an inordinate sense of superiority toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a despicable attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our Lord did not say that the Son of God would not be served by men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said that the Son of Man would not be served by men.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we go anywhere to preach the gospel, we have to go as a son of man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times, however, workers consider working among some people as a humbling experience!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is right to humble oneself, but it is wrong to consciously think that we are humbling ourselves by walking among certain kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we feel that we are humbling ourselves when we walk among less educated ones, this is proof that we are not humble enough.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such humility is manmade; it is unnatural.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When our Lord came to earth, men only recognized Him as the son of Mary or as the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They only knew Him as a son of man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers and sisters, we have to be real men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we are among our fellow men, we should not give them the flavor that we are above them in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not how a Christian should behave.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we are among men, we should be one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not give others the impression that we are condescending ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do, we are not qualified to serve anyone, and our way is totally wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can only serve men by being a man ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should never give others the impression that we are always humbling ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not give others the impression that we are different.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If others have that kind of impression about us, it proves that we are not God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to serve the Lord, we must be genuinely emptied of self.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we talk with those who have less education than we have and we stand aloof from them, we are telling them that we are not one of them.</S>
