	 <h2 class="head1">THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION<br />
BEING THE FOUNDATION FOR SPIRITUAL GROWTH</h2>
<p>These three aspects of proof are crucial points concerning the assurance of salvation. We should use these points when we preach the gospel. We should read all the books that cover this subject, such as &ldquo;Assurance of Salvation&rdquo; (<em>The Collected Works of Watchman Nee,</em> vol. 6), and chapter 15 in <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures.</em> Furthermore, we should practice speaking these points until we are familiar with them and are able to present them. No one helped me after I was saved, and I did not understand my salvation. Hence, I often vacillated between both doubt and fear. This went on for many years. It was not until I read &ldquo;Assurance of Salvation&rdquo; by Brother Nee that I was assured of my salvation. I obtained assurance and possessed the title deed. Hence, in order to help new believers have the assurance of their salvation, we need to lead them to see their title deed in the Bible.</p>
<p>The assurance of salvation is the foundation for growth in our spiritual life. If a believer does not have the assurance of his salvation, it will be very difficult for him to make spiritual progress. Hence, after leading someone to salvation, we must first perfect him by letting him know that he is saved, and we must give him the title deed. This is the foundation. The more secure this foundation is, the better. There are three aspects of this foundation: the outward proof&mdash;God&rsquo;s word; the inward proof&mdash;God&rsquo;s Spirit; and the proof of our experience of life. These three items&mdash;God&rsquo;s word, God&rsquo;s Spirit, and the experience of life&mdash;can be compared to a threefold cord. After a person is saved, he needs such a cord so that his salvation is secure and solid.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SPEAK</h2>
<p>We must also train ourselves in our speaking. When we converse with others, we must speak in a way that they can understand. It is not uncommon, however, for us to continue to speak even when others do not understand. Therefore, we must try our best to speak in a way that others can understand. I am from Shantung Province, and I speak with a Shantung dialect. However, by the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement and under Brother Nee&rsquo;s leading, I moved to Shanghai in 1933 and was required to give messages to the local saints. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace, I made the effort to avoid using expressions that the Southerners would not understand. Although my accent was still from Shantung, I tried to avoid words or expressions that they would not understand. This continued to be my practice when I went to America. Although my English is not good, the Americans understand me. I have tried my best to learn to speak in a way that they can understand and to avoid using words or expressions that are incomprehensible. Such a practice is related to the effectiveness of our work. Without such a practice, people will have only a vague idea of what we are saying.</p>
<p>The inflection of our voice and the speed of our speaking also have an impact on the effectiveness of our speaking. This is especially true with the inflection of our voice; hence, we should practice speaking. I have stayed with many American families and have observed that their children are trained to speak from an early age. As a result, everyone can understand them when they share in the meetings. The Chinese families, however, are relatively weak in giving this kind of education to their children. As a result, the Chinese-speaking brothers and sisters often speak with accents of various dialects, making it difficult for people to understand them.</p>
<p>This fellowship is especially for those who are learning to serve the Lord, because their work is mainly to speak. In order to preach the gospel, we need to speak; in order to edify the saints, we need to speak; when we visit people, we also need to speak. What do we do when we serve full time? We speak. Hence, we must learn to speak. When I was serving with Brother Nee in Shanghai, in every meeting he paid much attention to how the brothers and sisters prayed and spoke. Whenever he heard something inappropriate, he would write a personal note to the brother or sister, telling them that what they said or prayed was inappropriate. Even his mother received such a note. He was very strict in leading the meetings. He was never loose. Therefore, all the full-timers must learn to speak properly.</p>
<p>We should neither be careless nor fearful when we speak in the meetings. We simply need to learn to speak. Learning to speak can be compared to learning a language. We should first listen, then speak, and then speak after being corrected. We should not be afraid to speak after we are corrected; instead, we should continue to speak. Moreover, when we speak, we should care for others&rsquo; ears more than our throat. This means that we should open our mouth and thrust forth our voice. We should not rush our words even if we speak fast; we should enunciate every word. These matters require training.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must also learn to put sentences together so that what we say has meaning. We must express ourselves clearly and use words that are full of meaning. We should not be pretentious and use complex words that mean nothing to the hearers. It is better to use simple words so that people can understand us. Furthermore, if we use too many quotations from the Bible, others will be puzzled and not understand the main point. All these matters require practice.</p>
<p>I hope that those who are serving full time would be willing to schedule a time to study the truth, grasping this opportunity and not wasting their time. Since we have consecrated our life to the Lord, separating ourselves from the world and placing ourselves in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, we should treasure every breath, treasure every drop of blood, and treasure every minute we have. We should seize every opportunity to learn these matters. At the same time, we should pay attention to our health. We need some amount of exercise to maintain proper health. The Lord has always had mercy on me. He cares for me and keeps me so that I have been able to work for Him until this day. May we all be like this before the Lord.</p>
