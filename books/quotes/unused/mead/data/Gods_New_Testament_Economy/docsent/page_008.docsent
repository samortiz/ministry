   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first item of God s New Testament economy is the Word s incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second item in God s New Testament economy is the Son s living on this earth, which is the continuation of the Word s incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament, the first thing seen is the Word, who was God, becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the Triune God embodied in a Man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now this Man continues to live on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was the embodiment of the Triune God living the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His living is marvelous and needs thousands of words to describe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Highest Life</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God created different lives in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s creation began from the lowest life, which is the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Flowers, trees, and vegetables are living things, but their life is the lowest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their life does not have any personality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They do not have any feeling, and thought, or any love or hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then God created the animal life which is higher than the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Dogs can like you or dislike you, and sometimes they get mad and bark at you, but this is still not the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The third level of life created by God is on a higher plane.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the vegetable life, the animal life, and the human life, the earth would be desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This earth is quite pleasant and interesting due to these three lives.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The highest life in this universe, however, is the life of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Genesis 1 are the vegetables, the animals, and the man created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the creation of man, God brought this man to the tree of life, showing that there was still a life that was higher than the human life Gen 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This life is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Mingling of the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>with the Human Life</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament a marvelous thing happened the mingling of the divine life with the human life!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we say that the very embodiment of the Triune God lives the life of the Triune God, we mean this is a living of a combined life, a living of a mingled life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a life both human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The human life is wonderful and the divine life is marvelous, but now these two lives are married.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The divine life is the husband and the human life is the wife a wonderful couple!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the mingling of the divine life with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jesus Christ is the embodiment of such a mingling, and He lived a life, a particular life, an extraordinary life, a life that is a mingling of the divine life with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this life, in this living of such a life, we can see all the divine attributes and all the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the life lived by this embodiment of the Triune God in the Man, Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a living will develop into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The kingdom of God is just the living of the divine life mingled with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today the kingdom of God should be the church life the development of that wonderful living of two mingled lives.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Living a Combined Life</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We who are regenerated, who love the Lord, who seek after the Lord, and who are under God s transformation, must ask ourselves what kind of life we live.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not merely live a human, ethical life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must live a combined life a life that is a combination of the divine life with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such a life is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus Christ, as the very embodiment of the Triune God, lived such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His living sets up a model of the church life, and this life is one that lives God in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church life should be exactly the same as His living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was Jesus the Man, yet He lived the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was a Nazarene, yet He lived the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When He was twelve, He went to Jerusalem and He behaved, acted, and lived in a way that showed the divine life in a young human being.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was a Galilean human being, but the divine life was lived out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Luke 2 shows us a young, human boy only twelve years old living a life on the highest plane.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In that young life we can see the human virtues and the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the model of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When that young boy lived, the Son, the Father, and the Spirit all lived there with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Apart from the Bible, there is no human record of such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such a life is the result of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The incarnation of the Word was a dispensing that dispensed the Son with the Father by the Spirit into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then out of this incarnation the life of the Triune God was lived out in a young human being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The four Gospels firstly show us the incarnation of the Word and then present the Son s living, which was a combination of the divine life with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Embodiment of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Son s living on the earth was as the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>

   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It does not say the riches of the Godhead, but the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The difference between the riches and the fullness can be illustrated by a cup of water.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A cup which contains water has the riches of water.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It may have the riches of water, but these riches cannot be seen until the water fills the cup to overflowing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now the riches have become the fullness, which is the expression of the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Colossians 2:9 says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This means the riches of the Godhead are fully expressed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When this Man Jesus lived on the earth, He lived in a way that all the ones around Him saw the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Godhead in its fullness just flowed out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The fullness of the Godhead not only dwelt in Him, but flowed out of Him.</S>

   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He inherited all that God the Father had because He lived as the embodiment of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even when He was twelve years old He lived in a way that every one saw the fullness of the Godhead flowing out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>That was not merely His work or His ministry but His living.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He lived out the fullness of the Godhead; therefore, He could say, He who has seen Me has seen the Father John 14:9 .</S>
