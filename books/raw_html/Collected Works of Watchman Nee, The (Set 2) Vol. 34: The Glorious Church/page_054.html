<h1 class="series">THE VISION<br />OF THE GLORIOUS CHRIST</h1><h1 class="msg">INTRODUCTION</h1><p>The following article appeared in a book published by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room in the early 1950s. The content of the article is very similar to the first part of "Meditations on Revelation" published in Issue Nos. 4 and 6 of The Christian in February and April of 1926. (See Volume 4 of The Collected Works.) Since there is no way to ascertain whether or not this article is an edited version of the earlier article, we have included it in Volume 34 of The Collected Works as a separate article. Even as an edited version, however, we have the assurance that it was under the general editorship of Watchman Nee.</p>
