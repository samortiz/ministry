Recalling our discourse there and reflecting on it today, I still savor its taste. Not long after our farewell, I left Canton and arrived at Foochow via Hong Kong, Swatow, and Amoy. After a brief conversation with the brothers, I left for the city of Yung. After working there for more than a month, I left again for the co-workers' meeting in Chuanchow. I had planned to work at Sien-You after the conference in Chuanchow, but a letter from the brothers in Foochow urged me to promptly return to take charge of the newly rented hall at Tai-Jiang-Xun. Honoring their wish, I consented without hesitation. I arrived in Foochow on the fifth of July and have been working until this day. In the past four months, in spite of the grave political condition, by God's grace the work has never ceased. Every night we see the working of the Holy Spirit. More than X people have signed their name upon believing. Although one cannot say they all are genuine, there is a good number among them who have a good testimony. Furthermore, among those who believe, the majority are from Yah-Mei-Jou, Jung-Dang-Hou-Jou, Jung-Ting-Jie, Chang-Hsia-Jou, and the nearby riverside regions. Most of them are workers of industry or commerce. Since they have no relationship with the denominational Christians, this work is a pioneering one. If a new work is to commence in the future, these ones can be considered the basic members. Recently, because of the need of the circumstances, the edifying work has started; there are now meetings in two places, with the breaking of bread and other work going on without conflict. The situation is very good. I am concerned about how they will go on in the future. If you have any foresight in this matter, I hope to receive your instructions.</p><p>Regarding the work here, I feel that we are short in several areas: (1) The meeting hall is too small and can only accommodate one to two hundred people; (2) there are too few brothers who can take responsibility directly; (3) being alone and weak, I may not be able to continue for a long stretch of time. Please beseech the Lord to raise up more responsible brothers and workers. Pray also for me so that I may be freed from living by Hagar's bottled water and may enter into the realm of living springs. How is the recent situation in Hankow? Please greet Brother Lan for me. Here we feel no impact of the war, all walks of life remain calm, and work continues as usual. In addition, my mortal frame is as healthy as ever. The Lord willing, I hope to see you soon that I may be taught and benefited. Brother Je-dun has been laboring in northern Fukien recently. Brother Bi-yin has gone to eastern Fukien. Brother Chun-geng is again visiting the brothers in Yu-Si. Brother Jai-seng has returned to Han River. Sister Shu-min is carrying out a two-week edifying meeting for the women here. Soon she will go to Fu-Ching and then to southern Fukien. Brother Chiu's whole household is fine. Brothers Shih and Kwang-hwa continue their business as usual. Brother Tien-yiang got married at Pu-Tien last month, and now he works at Shieho Hospital. Sister Soon Shi-jiang, having left Chai-Jing, has decided to wholeheartedly serve the Lord. Presently, she is staying temporarily at Brother Wilson Wang's house; her future has yet to be determined. Sister Peace Lu has left Kutien Hospital. She is also waiting for the Lord's leading. Sister Li Shiu-yi has rendered much help to the work in the gospel hall. I will write about the rest at a later time. May peace be with you.</p><p>A weak one in the Lord,<br />Chen Jeng-fan<br />November 9<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
