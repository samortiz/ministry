   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SHINING AND KILLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Shining is another work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit deals with our outer man by these two means: discipline and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes He works by both means simultaneously and at other times consecutively.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes, the Holy Spirit disciplines us through the environment to knock out our strong spots.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At other times, He grants us special grace by enlightening us in a special way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must be clear that the flesh can only take shelter in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When darkness is gone, the flesh has no place to hide.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many acts of the flesh remain because we do not know them as the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As soon as light comes and we see them as the flesh, we become fearful to act the way we have before.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the church is rich, when God's word is released, when the ministry of the word is strong, and when prophesying is common, light is frequent and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once light shines, we realize what pride is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We begin to know the very thing that we have been talking about in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we spoke of pride previously, it was something we boasted of.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when we see pride under the light, we can only exclaim, "My goodness!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now I know that pride is so evil and filthy!"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The pride that we see under the light of revelation is completely different from the pride that we speak of with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The pride that we so glibly speak of does not appear loathsome and filthy to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even while we are speaking about it, we have very little feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when we are under the light, everything becomes different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Light exposes our true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The self that we see today is thousands of times more evil and filthy than the self that we spoke of in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Under such circumstances, our pride, self, and flesh will wilt away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will be removed and no longer survive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The wonderful thing is that whatever we see under the light is killed by the light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seeing and the killing do not happen consecutively.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not see our shortcomings and then remove them gradually years later.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we see our shortcomings under the shining, the shortcomings are finished immediately; they are killed immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Light kills; this is the most wonderful thing about the Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the Holy Spirit enlightens us, we are dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, revelation comprises seeing as well as killing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through seeing, the flesh withers away.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation is God's way of operation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In fact, revelation is God's operation itself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As soon as light reveals, it kills.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When light shines, we see, and our seeing kills everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once we see how filthy and evil something is and see the Lord's condemnation of it, it can no longer survive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The greatest thing in the Christian experience is the killing that comes from light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul did not receive a shining and then hasten to kneel beside the road; the very instant he was enlightened, he fell down.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Prior to that, he was able to plan for everything, and he was confident about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, his first reaction when the light came was to fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He became foolish and ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Light brought him down.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should take note that these two things happen as one step, not two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It does not happen the way we think.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God does not shine on us and make us understand, and then we carry out what He has shown us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God does not enlighten us concerning our shortcomings, and then we begin to change these shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No, God does not work this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He shows us how evil, filthy, and short we are, and as soon as we see this, we exclaim, "My!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What a filthy and evil man I am!"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As soon as God shows us our true condition, we fall.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We wither away and are not able to stand up any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once a proud man is enlightened, he is no longer able to be proud even if he tries.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once we have seen our true condition under God's light and once we have seen what our pride is, the impression will never leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Something will remain in us that will give us pain, that will give us the feeling that we are useless, and we will no longer be able to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When God shines on us, it is a time for believing and prostrating ourselves, not the time for petitioning.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many brothers and sisters busy themselves in prayer when God is speaking to them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As a result they do not see any light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The principle that brought us our initial salvation holds true for all subsequent works of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the time we were enlightened for our salvation, we did only one thing: We knelt down and prayed, "Lord, I accept You as my Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Following this, something happened.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a man prays after he hears the gospel, "Lord, I beg that You would be my Savior," he may pray the same prayer for a few days without feeling that the Lord has saved him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As soon as the Lord shines on us, we have to fall under His light and say, "Lord, I accept Your judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I accept Your view."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do this, God will give us more light and will show us how filthy we are.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The day that God shines His light on us, many things will change before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We thought that we had done many things in the name of the Lord and for love's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now the picture changes.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We discover that hidden beneath our noblest goals are base and ugly motives.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We thought that we were absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now we discover that we are full of plans for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In fact we are so full of these things that we can only fall on our faces.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Man's self creeps into every nook and cranny; it even tries to usurp God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"Is there anything that man cannot do?"</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Under God's shining, we find out the kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As soon as God's revelation comes, our condition is exposed and laid bare.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He exposes us, and we see ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Previously, only the Lord knew us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We were naked and laid bare before Him, but not before ourselves; we still did not know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But when God exposes all of the thoughts and intentions of the heart to us, we become naked not only before Him, but before ourselves as well.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we are naked and laid bare before ourselves, we no longer dare to lift up our heads.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Before we are exposed, we do not know ourselves, and we can easily get by.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But when we see ourselves under God's light, we are so ashamed that no place is good enough for us to hide ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Now we know what kind of person we are!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Now we know the kind of boasts we made!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We thought we were better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Now we know the kind of persons we are!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We cannot find more fitting terms before the Lord to describe ourselves; we can only say that we are filthy and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We admit that our eyes have been blind for years, that they have seen nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The more we see our filth, the more ashamed we become.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It seems as if all the shame of the whole world is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We prostrate before the Lord and repent, saying, "I repent of myself.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I hate myself.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I admit that I am an incurable man."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This shining, repentance, shame, loathing, and prostration will shake off what we have been unable to shake off all these years.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Man's salvation comes from this instant enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The seeing and removing are one work; the two are joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>As the Lord shines, He saves.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The shining is the saving, and the seeing is the deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We need this kind of seeing before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Only this kind of shining will remove our pride, and only this light will stop our fleshly activities and break our outer shell.</S>
