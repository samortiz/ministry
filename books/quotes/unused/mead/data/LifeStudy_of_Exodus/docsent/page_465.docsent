   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR THE SANCTIFICATION OF AARON AND HIS SONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE THE PRIESTS 12 Scripture Reading: Exo 29:29-46</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Exodus 29:38-40 says, And this is what you shall offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old, every day continually.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer between the evenings; and with the one lamb a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mingled with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to these verses, two lambs a year old were to be offered every day, one in the morning and the other in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Along with each lamb, there was to be an offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In typology, or in figure, a lamb signifies Christ as the One obedient to God and meek before men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Christ was on earth, He lived a life of obedience and meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The four Gospels indicate that Christ in His humanity was obedient and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When some read this word about the meekness of Christ, they may wonder if Christ was meek when He took a whip of cords and drove out the moneychangers from the temple John 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to remember that Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a man, He is obedient and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But He is also the Lord and the Master.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the Master, it was necessary for Him to chasten His people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A father may be very gentle and meek, but it is still sometimes necessary for him to discipline his children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A father should not say, I should always be a lamb in relation to my children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, I should not discipline them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In such a case, he would be a lamb-father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in the Bible there is no such thing as a lamb-father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, the Bible reveals that the Father must discipline, chasten, His children.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, the Lord s chastening of His people in no way detracts from His meekness as a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE LIFE PRODUCER AND LIFE SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us now go on to consider the items of the vegetable life in Exodus 29: the wheat, the oil, and the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In The All-Inclusive Christ we have pointed out in detail that wheat and barley are both types of Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the vegetable life, Christ is the One who produces life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A grain of wheat is useful in producing life and also in producing food for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a grain of wheat is sown into the ground, it eventually grows and produces wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the wheat is ground into flour, it becomes suitable for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, wheat signifies Christ as the life producer and also as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Gospel of John we have a revelation of Christ as the life producer and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In John 6:41 the Lord Jesus said, I am the bread that came down out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Elsewhere in the same chapter, the Lord used five barley loaves and two fishes to feed the multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, according to John 12:24, the Lord Jesus was a grain of wheat who fell into the ground to produce many grains: Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In chapter six of John we have the life supply, and in chapter twelve, the life producing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we offer Christ to God in the morning as our sin offering, we shall be brought into a clear situation with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We shall also have a clear conscience, a liberated spirit, and an atmosphere of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Spontaneously, during the day Christ will be a lamb to us, and we shall live Him as this lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, we shall also experience Christ as a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we live Him, He will become our life supply, and He will also produce something within us that is good for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the way to grow Christ as wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Are you still wondering how to grow Christ as wheat?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The way to grow Christ is to live Him as your life supply and as the One who produces life within you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Words are not adequate to describe this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we daily offer Christ as our sin offering, other experiences of Christ will follow automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By offering Christ to God as our sin offering, we indicate strongly that we mean business with God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps in the past we were somewhat negligent and did not mean business with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, offering Christ to God as a sin offering proves that we are serious with the Lord in living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Previously we may have talked about living Christ, but were not seriously intending to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But from the time we sincerely begin to offer Christ as a sin offering, we indicate that we mean business with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a result of offering Christ as the sin offering, the sky is clear over us, our spirit is freed, and spontaneously Christ as the life-giving Spirit has the ground in us to move and the opportunity to energize us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then spontaneously we live Him as a lamb and also as a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way we raise Christ as a lamb, and we grow Him as wheat.</S>
