   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for this Spirit contains the element of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually, the Spirit Himself is life.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit is not only life within essentially but also power without economically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we want to receive the Pentecostal power, we need to go through the cross of Christ so that we can be brought into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we will experience the Spirit as our life inwardly and our power outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>XIII.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE COMPOUND SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>TYPIFIED BY THE COMPOUND HOLY OINTMENT</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The compound ointment has olive oil as a base compounded with four spices, myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The numbers related to this compound ointment are very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The one unit of olive oil is compounded with four spices.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One signifies the unique God, and four signifies the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows that the unique God is compounded with man, the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, there are five substances in the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Five in the Bible signifies responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 are divided into two groups of five, and the ten virgins in Matthew 25 are divided into two groups of five.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our hand has four fingers plus one thumb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The four fingers signify man and the one thumb signifies God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We, the four, plus God, the one, bear responsibility, five.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every day our hands bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without a thumb, how could we pick up our Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need the four fingers plus the thumb to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the same way, we need ourselves plus God to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every day we need to have a "plus."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our "plus" is God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Also the four spices of the compound ointment are divided into three units of five hundred shekels each.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Five hundred means one unit of full responsibility, and three signifies the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The three units of five hundred shekels each, in four spices, signify the Triune God in resurrection mingled with humanity to bear the full responsibility.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Triune God today has been consummated to be such an all-inclusive Spirit with all the marvelous elements of His person and work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I was a young Christian, I read some books which pointed out from the Word that we have died with Christ Rom 6:8a .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I asked myself how I could experience this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then I was taught that I should reckon myself to be dead Rom 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is a hymn by A. B. Simpson which speaks of reckoning ourselves to be dead to sin Hymns, #692 . I tried to reckon myself to have died with Christ, but this did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother Watchman Nee taught that we should reckon ourselves as having died with Christ in his book entitled The Normal Christian Life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, however, Brother Nee discovered that we cannot experience Christ's death in Romans 6 unless we experience the Spirit in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The death of Christ is in the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Where is the Triune God?</S>

   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this message I am sharing how to experience the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Without this Spirit, we cannot experience the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ.</S>
