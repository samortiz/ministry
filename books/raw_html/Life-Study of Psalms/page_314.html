<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE PRAISE OF ISRAEL<br>IN THEIR GOING UP TO ZION CONCERNING<br>JEHOVAH'S HELP IN THE INVASIONS OF THEIR ENEMIES</H2><P>Psalm 124 is the praise of Israel in their going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's help in the invasions of their enemies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Not Giving Them as a Prey</H2><P>When their enemies rose up in anger against them like the insolent waters flowing over them to swallow them up, Jehovah did not give them as a prey to their teeth (vv. 1-6). The psalmist said that if Jehovah had not been on their side, the proud waters would have passed over their soul. The psalmist then praised Jehovah for His help. "Blessed be Jehovah, who has not given us/As prey to their teeth" (v. 6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Their Help Being in the Name of Jehovah</H2><P>Speaking in a poetic way, the psalmist continued, "Our soul has escaped like a bird,/Out of the snare of the fowlers;/The snare is broken,/And we have escaped" (v. 7). They were like birds threatened by fowlers, but due to Jehovah's help, they escaped the snare. Thus, the psalmist concluded by declaring, "Our help is in the name of Jehovah,/Who made heaven and earth" (v. 8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE PRAISE OF THE SAINTS<br>IN THEIR GOING UP TO ZION CONCERNING<br>JEHOVAH'S SURROUNDING OF HIS PEOPLE</H2><P>Psalm 125 is the praise of the saints in their going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's surrounding of His people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Those Who Trust in Jehovah<br>Being like Mount Zion</H2><P>In verse 1 the psalmist says that those who trust in Jehovah are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but abides forever. They loved Mount Zion and they likened themselves to Mount Zion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah Surrounding His People<br>from Now to Eternity</H2><P>Verse 2 tells us that as the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Jehovah surrounds His people from now to eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah Judging Righteously</H2><P>The psalmist continues by saying that Jehovah judges righteously those upright in their hearts and those turning aside to their crooked ways (vv. 3-5a). In verse 4a the psalmist prays, "Do good, O Jehovah, to the good." The expression "the good" indicates that the psalmist's concept was still according to the principle of good and evil. No one is good except God (Mark 10:18). How, then, could the psalmist ask God to do good to the good? This prayer shows the influence of the old tradition upon the psalmist.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Blessing Israel with Peace</H2><P>This psalm ends with the psalmist's blessing Israel, saying, "Peace be upon Israel" (v. 5b).</P>
