As the Realization of God the Son,<br>Who Is the Embodiment of God the Father,<br>Coming to Be the Reality of the Triune God<br>Not Only with God the Son's Believers<br>but Also in Them</H2><P>The all-inclusive Spirit, as the realization of God the Son, who is the embodiment of God the Father, came to be the reality of the Triune God, not only with God the Son's believers but also in them, for the dispensing of the Triune God into them (John 14:9-11, 16-20). First Christ, who became the life-giving Spirit as the transfiguration, the realization of the threefold human seed, breathed Himself into the disciples, and the disciples received Him. Then, based on this breathing, the Spirit whom He became came to be the realization of Him as the embodiment of the Father within the believers. In this way the Triune God entered into us to be one with us.</P><P>Before Christ's resurrection the Triune God was not able to enter into man. After He went through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, He was qualified to breathe Himself into His disciples as the Holy Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God, for them to receive. This life-giving Spirit is the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father. As such a One, He comes into His disciples to be in their intrinsic being. What a blessing this is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. As the Spirit of Reality Declaring,<br>Transmitting, the Triune God<br>into the Son's Believers<br>for the Glorification of God the Son</H2><P>As the Spirit of reality, the Spirit declares, transmits, to the believers what He receives of God the Son, to whom all that God the Father has is given, transmitted, for the dispensing of the Triune God into the Son's believers, making them one with the Triune God, for the glorification of God the Son (John 16:13-15). John 16:13-15 says, "But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you." First, what the Father has is given, or transmitted, to the Son. This is the first step of the transmission. Then, what the Son has is received by the Spirit. This is the second step of the transmission. Finally, what the Spirit has received is declared, or transmitted, to the disciples. This is the third step of the transmission. This transmission involves four parties&#151;the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and us, the believers. What the Father has is given, transmitted, to the Son; what the Son has is received by the Spirit; and what the Spirit receives is declared, transmitted, to us. This is the transmission of the Triune God into the Son's believers.</P><P>The Spirit's declaring is His transmission. What the Spirit declares is not doctrines but spiritual realities. In the universe there is the reality that whatever God the Father has is given to the Son; whatever the Son has is received by the Spirit; and all the things of the Father and the Son are declared by the Spirit to us, the disciples. Thus, there is a wonderful transmission in the universe&#151;the transmission of the Triune God into our being.</P><P>The transmission of the Triune God into the Son's believers makes them one with the Triune God for the glorification of God the Son. Our being made one with the Triune God is to glorify the Son, that is, to express the Son as glory. If we live a life in the transmission of the Triune God, we will be a glorious expression of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 60</div><br></body></html>
