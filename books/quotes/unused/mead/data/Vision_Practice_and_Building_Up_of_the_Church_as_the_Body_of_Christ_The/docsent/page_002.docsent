   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE GOD S ETERNAL PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 3:9-11; 1:4-11; 3:19; Col 2:9; Eph 1:19; Col 1:29; 1 Cor 1:24</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these messages our burden is to consider the church in six aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we need to see the church in eternity past in the purpose and plan of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, we must see the church in the Old Testament types, shadows, and figures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although it may seem that the church is not mentioned in the Old Testament, in actuality there are many references to the church in the Old Testament in the way of types and figures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A number of positive women in the Old Testament are types of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eve is the first type of the church Gen 2:22; 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After Eve come Sarah and Rebekah 17:15-16, 19; 24:15, 64-67 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, we come to the Shulammite in the Song of Songs 6:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Eve we see only the origin of the church, but the Shulammite as the counterpart of Solomon is a type of the church in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition, the positive buildings in the Old Testament are types of the church, including the ark of Noah, the tabernacle, the temple, and the holy city Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to study the church, we need to study the stories of all these women and of all these buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a corporate way, we may call them the bride and the house, and we may call these two aspects of the church the bridal aspect and the building aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is a bride-building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to read and study the stories of all those positive women to know the bridal aspect of the church, and we need to study the stories of all those wonderful buildings to know the building aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually at the end of the entire Scripture as an ultimate consummation and conclusion, there is a city with two aspects, the bridal aspect and the building aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The holy city, New Jerusalem, is the bride, and it is also the tabernacle Rev 21:9-10, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also need to see the progress of the church what transpired with the church and what the church has undergone since the day of Pentecost and the recovery of the church from the time of the Reformation to the present century.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must also consider the testimony of the church and the church in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Altogether these are six main aspects of the church: in eternity past in God s plan and purpose, in the Old Testament types, in its progress, in its recovery, in its present testimony, and in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE ECONOMY OF THE MYSTERY HIDDEN IN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Almost all the items revealed concerning God s eternal plan for the church are in two books Ephesians and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ephesians contains the revelation of the Body, while Colossians is the revelation of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we put these two together, we have the universal man, the Head with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to know the Body we must know the Head, and in order to know the Head we need to know the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, if we are going to know Ephesians, we must know Colossians, and if we are going to know Colossians, we must know Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To know the eternal plan of God concerning the church, we need to come to the book on the Body, Ephesians, with the help of the book on the Head, Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ephesians 3:9-11 says, To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would ask the young brothers and sisters, if possible, to memorize these three verses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To enlighten all in verse 9 means to bring to light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Greek, all is an all-inclusive word, including men, angels, heaven, earth, and the many items of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 9 also speaks of the economy of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Economy and mystery are two great words in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A complete dictionary such as Webster s Dictionary gives the origin of the word economy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Economy is from the Greek word oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This economy was hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before the creation there was only God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time only God Himself knew the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then ever since the time of creation, God never told anyone about His mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Throughout the ages this mystery was known only by God Himself; it was something hidden in God as a mystery that not one of the creatures knew, including the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Eternal Purpose Plan</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Which God Purposed in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 10 speaks of the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies and of the multifarious wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These also are great matters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 11 mentions the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For purpose we may use the word plan also.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The eternal plan, or eternal purpose, is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This passage speaks of a single aim concerning the church, that is, to make God s multifarious wisdom known to the rulers and authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is according to the eternal plan which God planned in Christ.</S>
