   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church of God, the Church of Christ, and the Church of the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the churches raised up by the work are not our churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the New Testament there is only the church of God 1 Cor 1:2; 10:32 , the church of Christ Rom 16:16 , and the church of the saints 1 Cor 14:33; 1 Thes 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is not a church of the apostles in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostles are the slaves serving the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:5, "For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have a question mark, though, about some of you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You are trying to build up yourselves, and you do not consider yourselves as slaves to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No church belongs to any apostle or to any worker.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the missionary way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the missionaries who went to China claimed that what they raised up was their church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If they were sent by the Baptist Mission, they raised up a Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If they were sent by the Presbyterian Mission, they raised up a Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must ask ourselves whether we also claim our churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, we all would say that we never claimed the churches in this way, but we must consider what is unconsciously there in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do believe that even the angels could testify for me that I never considered any church as my church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some people accuse me of controlling, and some have even said that I control the Far East with a "remote papal system."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One brother from one of the churches in Taiwan recently testified that the leading elder in his locality was altogether against my ministry for six years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This brother also testified that during these six years I did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For six years this leading elder was against me to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He brought in a kind of pentecostal teaching and publicly told people in the meetings that he found contradicting portions in my Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I never did anything, however, to vindicate myself or the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is just one example which shows that I do not control the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All of us must reconsider where we actually are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are many subconscious and subtle things hidden within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ambition and Pride</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the problems are due to two old "gophers" ambition and pride.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If our ambition plus our pride had been killed, there would never be any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We like a position.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We like to be honored and highly regarded by people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may not say this, but we must be honest before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What has been within our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we were not ambitious, we could never have trouble with others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not have ambition and if we do not have any element of pride, we would have no problem with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I heard about that case in Taiwan, it did not bother me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Could you stand this kind of test?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Think about the real situation around you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why do you need to be afraid that you would be cut off?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because of the subtle thing hidden within you ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You want to keep your position.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are not afraid of being nothing, you would never think that people would cut you off.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To try to preserve your position and to safeguard it is the foolish way to keep your position.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the church position is just like a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you do not want it, it comes to you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you want it, it flies away.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I first came to San Francisco, I saw some doves on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I approached them, they flew away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I walked away, they all flew back to the same spot.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Position is like a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you want it, it flies away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you are hunting for position and you want to have a position, you will never get it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you say that you do not want position and if you flee from it, it will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To keep a position, the wisest way is not to have it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you want to grasp a position, the position is gone already.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not yours because you are not qualified to keep that position.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is something very subtle which has killed all the Christians during the past centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Why have there been power struggles among many Christians and Christian groups?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The reason is the ambition for position.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I hate to see that this kind of element would come into the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all must admit, however, that we are still human.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the one hand, we are saints.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the other hand, we are still human.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I must testify that day after day I was trembling before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I prayed in such a way: "Lord, thank You for another day to live You.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I need Your mercy and I need Your preserving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Without this, Lord, You know I am still natural.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am still so much in my self in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Lord, You know that immediately without Your mercy and grace, I would live according to my flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I need You, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we have a heart which is not so purified but rather mixed up with a main purpose for the Lord's recovery and a subsidiary purpose hidden for ourselves, whatever we do will cause us trouble.</S>
