   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Hebrews reveals that Christ suffered the shame of death 2:9; 12:2; 13:12b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Christ tasted death on behalf of everything, He suffered and endured shame.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be shamed and insulted is to suffer in such a way as to be tired out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The suffering of insulting shame always wears people out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the cross Christ suffered the greatest shame the shame of death.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ did not know sin in an experiential way by contact or personal experience cf.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 8:46; 1 Pet 2:22; Heb 4:15; 7:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In experience, in direct contact, the Lord Jesus had nothing to do with sin, and He did not know sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, He became sin and took away the sin of the world so that the problem of sin might be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sin came from Satan as the rebel against God Isa 14:12-15 , entered into man Rom 5:12 , and made man not only a sinner but sin itself under God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, when Christ became a man in the flesh John 1:14 , He was made sin not sinful on our behalf to be judged by God Rom 8:3 that we might become God's righteousness in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During the last three hours He was on the cross, Christ was made sin in the sight of God.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the One who was made sin for us, Christ as our Substitute was judged by God once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>13.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a Man in the Flesh Causing Sin to Be Condemned in the Flesh by God</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In His death Christ as a man in the flesh caused sin to be condemned in the flesh by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 8:3 says, "God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The flesh is of sin, and the Son of God did indeed become flesh John 1:14; Heb 2:14; 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, He was only in the likeness of the flesh and had no participation in the sin of the flesh.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that sin dwells in a certain element, and this element is man's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our flesh is thus the habitation of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sin dwells in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, sin has actually become one with our flesh, making our flesh virtually the incarnation of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Incarnation refers to one thing which was formerly outside another thing entering into that thing and becoming one with it.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same principle, sin has become one with our flesh, making it the incarnation of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When God the Father sent God the Son concerning sin and to deal with sin, even to abolish it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He sent Him not in the reality of the flesh of sin but in the likeness, in the appearance, of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that God sent Christ in the likeness of the flesh that had become sin's incarnation.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Romans 8:3 clearly reveals that God has condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In whose flesh did God condemn sin?</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified in the flesh, God condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, in the flesh of Jesus Christ and through His work in His death, God condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ was a man in the flesh, and He died on the cross as a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As such a man in the flesh, He had only the likeness of the flesh of sin, not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There was no sin in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ's humanity does not have sin, but nevertheless His humanity was in some way related to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, His dying on the cross as a man in the flesh caused sin to be condemned in the flesh by God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In other words, God condemned indwelling sin through Christ's work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ accomplished a work in His death through which God condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
