[5]  HOW TO STUDY THE BIBLE PREFACE TO THE CHINESE EDITION
[6]  The Bible shows us what God has done for us in the past and what He has said.
[7]  We must let the word of God dwell richly in our hearts before we can hear His speaking today and before He can make us ministers of His word.
[8]  In order to study the Bible properly, one has to meet two basic requirements.
[9]  Many of them are very good, but almost all are short in one matter they only pay attention to methods of studying the Bible; they do not pay enough attention to the person who is studying the Bible.
[10]  CHAPTER ONE THREE PREREQUISITES I. THE NEED TO BE SPIRITUAL A. "The Words Which I Have Spoken...Are Spirit"
[11]  In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit."
[12]  The words of the Bible are not only letters but spirit.
[13]  We also should recall the Lord's word in John 4:24: "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit."
[14]  Here the Lord points out a fundamental principle: God is Spirit, and man can only touch Him with his spirit.
[15]  God is Spirit, and we can only worship Him with our spirit; we cannot worship Him with anything other than the spirit.
[16]  When some unbelievers argue with us, we may not match them in eloquence or wisdom, and we may not be able to tell them profound teachings, but we have the confidence that we know God because we are regenerated.
[17]  Some may ask, "I am regenerated, and I have a regenerated spirit.
[18]  But we do speak wisdom among those who are full-grown, yet a wisdom not of this age...But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory."
[19]  But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.
[20]  But we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things which have been graciously given to us by God; which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things with spiritual words."
[21]  Suppose you take a man who is born blind into a garden and tell him that he is standing in front of a mango tree.
[22]  You can explain to the blind man what the fruits are like.
[23]  Many portions of the Bible explicitly speak of light.
[24]  In Matthew 6:22 the Lord Jesus spoke on the light of the heart, saying, "The lamp of the body is the eye."
[25]  God grants us revelation of scriptural teachings according to the measure of obedience we render to Him.
[26]  The more we obey Him, the more light we will receive.
[27]  If we continue to obey God, we will continue to see.
[28]  Second, no one can be careless in reading the Bible.
[29]  I have heard some say that we put on the righteous robe of the Lord Jesus, that God has given us the righteousness of Christ as our robe of righteousness, and that we are no longer naked, but now can come to God.
[30]  Some have said that the blood of the Lord Jesus gives us life.
[31]  They say that when we drink the Lord's blood, we acquire His life.
[32]  If we read this verse in a superficial way, we may agree with this teaching.
[33]  In order to study the Bible well, we need to acquaint ourselves with three things related to the Holy Spirit.
[34]  First, the Holy Spirit desires that we enter into His thoughts.
[35]  In order to understand the words of the Holy Spirit, we must direct our thoughts to the thoughts of the Holy Spirit.
[36]  If we do not know the intention of the Holy Spirit behind a portion, we are liable to make a mistake in quoting it at a later time; we may even twist the original meaning of the Holy Spirit.
[37]  Some parts of the Bible are subject texts, while others are explanatory words; some are primary in importance, while others are ancillary in function.
[38]  We should find out what the Holy Spirit is saying in a passage, how He is saying it, how many things are spoken of, and how many words He has used to achieve His goal.
[39]  First, we can separate the subject text from the explanatory words.
[40]  It is not a bad idea to go through the New Testament and put parentheses around passages that the Spirit provides as words of explanation.
[41]  Verses 2-4 say, "Which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord."
[42]  When reading the Bible, the Holy Spirit next requires that we capture an impression from the facts.
[43]  Once we have an impression of these facts from the Holy Spirit, it will be easy for Him to convey God's word to us.
[44]  If our heart and spirit are open to God, and if our feelings are refined, the flashing of the facts of the Holy Spirit before us will generate a strong impression within us.
[45]  Examples of Contrasts a. Zaccheus and the Two Disciples
[46]  In contrasting Luke 19 with Luke 24, we find a marked difference between the Lord's stay at Zaccheus's house and His entering the house with the two disciples who were on the way to Emmaus.
[47]  Matthew 8:23-27 speaks of the instance when the Lord Jesus crossed the sea with the disciples.
[48]  In Matthew's record the disciples said, "Lord, save us; we are perishing!" v. 25 . But Mark 4:38 has something more to say: "Teacher, does it not matter to You...?" That means that they questioned how He could sleep so soundly.
[49]  Attempting to Teach the Lord 1 "This Ointment Could Have Been...Given to the Poor"
[50]  Sometimes men were not only dissatisfied with the Lord; they even tried to teach the Lord.
[51]  Mark 2 records four men carrying a paralytic to the Lord Jesus.
[52]  Being unable to bring him to the Lord because of the crowd, they removed the roof where He was, and lowered the paralytic to the Lord vv.
[53]  If we do not have a clear impression of what the Lord has done, how can we say that we know Him?
[54]  In the story of the good Samaritan in Luke 10, we should focus on the Lord's word.
[55]  The Lord always hid Himself; He did not like to have a name for Himself.
[56]  After He healed the leper, He charged him not to tell anyone Matt 8:4 .
[57]  After He drove out the company of demons, He charged the previously possessed man to go home and to speak what God had done for him Luke 8:39 .
[58]  After God revealed Him to Peter as the Christ, the Lord charged the disciples not to tell others 16:20 .
[59]  B. How to Touch the Spirit behind the Word
[60]  We must point out that this can be realized only through the discipline of the Holy Spirit, not by man's effort.
[61]  The discipline of the Holy Spirit means that God's Spirit comes in to replace man's work.
[62]  God's Spirit arranges everything in the environment and operates until our spirit matches the spirit of the Scriptures.
[63]  If our very person has not been dealt with and disciplined by God, and if God has not operated in us systematically, we will be shrouded with a veil when we come to the Word.
[64]  The Holy Spirit is matching our spirit with the spirit of the Bible.
[65]  The spirit of the Lord Jesus is thousands of times greater than our spirit.
[66]  Why do we treasure a portion of the Scriptures so much, yet another brother sees nothing precious about it?
[67]  This is because we capture the spirit of that portion of the Scripture, while the other brother does not.
[68]  I am not saying that the other brother does not have a spirit.
[69]  I am saying that his spirit is not in step with the spirit of this portion of the Word.
[70]  If we are not rich in such experiences, our feelings will not be rich, and if our spiritual feelings are not rich, our knowledge of the Bible will not be rich.
[71]  "And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred forty and seven years.
[72]  And the time drew nigh that Israel must die" 47:28-29 .
[73]  We should notice that at his birth he was called Jacob but at his death he was called Israel.
[74]  "And he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: but I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace.
[75]  Verse 21 says, "And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers."
[76]  In the previous section we took note of the person who studies the Bible.
[77]  In studying the Bible, we must not only be right persons, but we must also have the right methods.
[78]  CHAPTER THREE KEYS TO STUDYING THE BIBLE I. BY SEARCHING
[79]  In other words, if we want to find out anything from the Bible, we have to search for it in the Scriptures themselves.
[80]  In order to have the word of Christ dwelling in us richly, at least we have to memorize the Scriptures.
[81]  But we can say that if one does not memorize God's Word, he certainly cannot have it dwelling in him richly.
[82]  If a man merely memorizes the Scriptures with his mind, but his heart is not receptive or open to God and he is not submissive or meek, his memorization will not result in God's word dwelling in his heart.
[83]  Yet if a man thinks that there is no need to memorize God's word because he only needs to be meek and submissive and open and receptive to God, he also will not be able to have God's word dwelling in his heart.
[84]  If we do not memorize it, we will forget what we have read, and we will reap little benefit from it.
[85]  If we compare the spiritual man with the spiritual things, we will see something.
[86]  If we realize that no Scripture should be interpreted by its own interpretation, we immediately will look for the meaning of "sharp sword" when we come to this passage, and from Ephesians 6:17 we will find that the sharp sword refers to the word of God.
[87]  Every Bible reader must set aside a certain amount of time every day to study the Bible in a definite way.
[88]  During the second twenty minutes, we can turn to lighter subjects, such as the study of specific words.
[89]  There are at least two to three hundred words in the Bible that need to be studied in depth.
[90]  The fourth period is ten minutes for paraphrasing the Bible.
[91]  When we have a fresh understanding of a portion of the Word, we should write out the whole portion in simple and intelligible language for the easy comprehension of others.
[92]  A person who is trained in this exercise will find meaning and significance in every word of the Bible.
[93]  If our emphasis is on how our old man is crucified with Him, we can say, "Because God has placed us in Christ, we are crucified together with Him."
[94]  If we come across a verse that we do not quite understand, we have to ask the Lord to shine on us so that we can express the verse in language simpler than the original and in utterance more concise than an exegesis.
[95]  While we are reading the Bible, we have to jot down notes.
[96]  In studying Adam's history, we have to know about his place in God's plan, his creation, his initial innocence and sinlessness, his relationship with Eve, his judgment from God and the promise he received from God after the fall, his expulsion from the garden of Eden, his life outside Eden, and finally, his relation to the last Adam.
[97]  In order to study the types in the Old Testament, we must first have a foundation of the New Testament.
[98]  The New Testament speaks of Christ, His redemption, the church, and the Holy Spirit.
[99]  We can classify the prophecies in the Bible into two categories, those concerning Christ's first coming and those concerning His second coming.
[100]  The Bible contains many topics, including: 1 creation, 2 man, 3 angels, 4 sin, 5 the satanic kingdom, 6 salvation, 7 repentance, 8 the person of Christ, 9 the work of Christ, 10 the life of Christ, 11 the Holy Spirit, 12 regeneration, 13 eternal life, 14 eternal security, 15 sanctification, 16 justification, 17 selection, 18 forgiveness, 19 righteousness, 20 freedom, 21 law, 22 inspiration, 23 revelation, 24 the Body of Christ, 25 ministers of the word, 26 God's authority, 27 the second coming of Christ, 28 judgment, 29 the kingdom, 30 eternity, etc. At the beginning we can study one topic a year.
[101]  Some have classified God's relationship with man in the Bible according to the following considerations: 1 God, 2 men in general, that is, humanity in general, 3 the individual, 4 the God-man, 5 God and man, 6 God in man, and 7 God over men.
[102]  Fourth, we have the God-man, which we see in the Gospels; the Lord Jesus is the God-man.
[103]  We can go through all the parables of the Bible.
[104]  After studying a few of them carefully, we will realize that there are certain principles to interpreting parables.
[105]  Once we identify principles, we will know how to interpret other parables when we study them.
[106]  We can study all the teachings that the Lord taught, including Matthew 5, 6, 7, 13, 24, 25.
[107]  The Bible contains many crucial chapters, such as Genesis 2 and 3, Numbers 21, and Deuteronomy 8.
[108]  We can group subjects such as the Lord's calling, His blood, and His work under the category of salvation; we can group all the work of the Holy Spirit under the category of sanctification; and we can group subjects such as endurance, testimony, and the power of the Holy Spirit under ministry.
[109]  We can classify all these teachings under these categories; they can be things that God has done for us, things that He is doing in us, or things that He will do through us.
[110]  The Bible speaks of all kinds of minerals and stones.
[111]  In the Bible we often find a passage written in a way that is different from the immediately surrounding text; the style of such passages in Greek is different from the rest of the surrounding text, and it more closely resembles poetry rather than prose.
[112]  We have Abraham's prayer for Sodom and Gomorrah, Moses' prayer for the rebellious children of Israel, David's prayers in the Psalms, Ezra's prayer in chapter nine of his book, Nehemiah's prayer in chapter nine of his book, Daniel's prayer in chapter nine of his book, the prayer the Lord taught the disciples in Matthew 6, His own prayer in John 17, Paul's prayer in Ephesians, etc. If we study these prayers one by one, we will have a good grasp of the whole subject of prayer.
[113]  After we have agreed on the above principles, we can group the difficult passages in the Bible together.
[114]  For example, there are "the sons of God" in Genesis 6:2, "go down alive into Sheol" in Numbers 16:30, "An old man is coming up....Saul knew that it was Samuel" in 1 Samuel 28:14, "Concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even...the Son" in Matthew 24:36, the two swords in Luke 22:38, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them" in John 20:23, "renew themselves again unto repentance" in Hebrews 6:6, "There no longer remains a sacrifice...for sins" in Hebrews 10:26, "The spirits in prison" in 1 Peter 3:19, and "The gospel was announced also to those who are now dead" in 1 Peter 4:6.
[115]  Of course, man had sinned by Genesis 3 already.
[116]  But the sinning in Genesis 3 is different from man's becoming flesh in Genesis 6.
[117]  Sinning is an act; it does not describe the nature of things.
[118]  We must not only take note of man's fall in chapter three, but we must realize that there was a progression to man's sinfulness.
[119]  We can also study the Bible book by book.
[120]  The study of topics concentrates on subjects; the exact wordings of the Bible may not necessarily match the subjects exactly, but we can consider the content and the spiritual meaning of the texts, putting texts together that are similar in content and spiritual meaning.
[121]  If we serve God in His field as our Lord did, we spontaneously will be fed as we work because our food is to do the will of the Father.
[122]  He put several dozen verses together and grouped them into ten sections.
[123]  There are about seven fundamental doctrines in the Bible.
[124]  They are: 1 God the Father, 2 the Son of God, 3 the Holy Spirit, 4 sin, 5 redemption, 6 the Christian life and living, and 7 future events.
[125]  Concerning God the Father, we can consider His name, His heart, His nature, His attributes, His power, His authority, His relationship with the Son, His way of redemption, etc. We must also group all the related verses together.
[126]  In reading Genesis we find that God is the Creator, the Ruler, the Law-giver, the Judge, and also the Redeemer.
[127]  The truth about God in the Old Testament is progressive.
[128]  This book discusses a fundamental lesson facing a servant of Christ the breaking of the outer man by the Lord for the release of the spirit.
[129]  The only work God approves is that of the spirit, and the breaking of the outer man is the only way that the spirit can have full freedom.
[130]  CHAPTER ONE THE IMPORTANCE OF BREAKING Scripture Reading: John 12:24; Heb 4:12-13; 1 Cor 2:11-14; 2 Cor 3:6; Rom 1:9; 7:6; 8:4-8; Gal 5:16, 22-23, 25
[131]  Sooner or later a servant of God discovers that he himself is the greatest frustration to his work.
[132]  Sooner or later he finds that his outer man does not match his inner man.
[133]  The inner man heads in one direction, while the outer man heads in another direction.
[134]  He discovers that his outer man cannot be subject to the rule of the spirit and cannot walk according to God's highest demands.
[135]  He discovers that the greatest hindrance to his work is his outer man and that this outer man frustrates him from exercising his spirit.
[136]  Every servant of God should be able to exercise his spirit, to secure God's presence in his spirit, to know God's word through his spirit, to touch men's condition by his spirit, to convey God's word through his spirit, and to sense and receive divine revelation with his spirit.
[137]  God resides in the inner man, and the man outside this God-occupied inner man is the outer man.
[138]  If we have never learned to break through our outer man with our spirit, we cannot work for the Lord.
[139]  Whether or not our work will be effective depends on whether the Lord has broken down our outer man and whether the inner man can be released through our broken, outer man.
[140]  The Bible speaks of ointment of pure nard John 12:3 .
[141]  The Lord breaks our outer man in two ways.
[142]  First, He breaks it in a cumulative way, and second, He breaks it in a sudden way.
[143]  Why do so many people remain unchanged after being dealt with for years?
[144]  Others have a strong will, strong emotions, or a strong mind, yet the Lord can still break them.
[145]  The breaking of the outer man is a basic experience which every servant of the Lord must go through.
[146]  First, his outer man is never broken and his spirit is never aroused.
[147]  If we do not settle it the first day we believe in the Lord, we will have to settle it sooner or later, even if it is ten years later.
[148]  First, in the matter of preaching, we often preach earnestly, persuasively, and logically.
[149]  The outer man is working, but the inner man does not join in. The outer man and the inner man do not match; they are not in unison.
[150]  If the outer man is broken, the spirit spontaneously will remain in the Lord all the time.
[151]  A brother read Brother Lawrence's book The Practice of the Presence of God the second year after he was saved.
[152]  But if God is merciful to us, He will break our outer man, and our inner man will no longer be touched when many things happen to us.
[153]  If we know the breaking of the outer man, we can enjoy God's continual presence without interruption from the outer man, whether we are rebuking a brother severely or praying in the presence of God.
[154]  When the outer man is broken, all outward activities are confined to the outward realm while the inner man continues to enjoy God's presence.
[155]  Strictly speaking, the outward things can only affect the outer man; but the outer man, in turn, affects the inner man.
[156]  If God is merciful to us and if our outer man is broken, it will be separated from our inner man, and outward things will only affect the outer man; they will not affect the inner man.
[157]  A man can converse with others with his outer man while his inner man is still fellowshipping with God.
[158]  If God is merciful to us and we have such an experience of separation, we will conduct business and move around in our outer man, but our inner man will be unmoved.
[159]  The breaking of the outer man is accomplished through the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and the separation of the outer man from the inner man is through the revelation of the Holy Spirit.
[160]  Let me first explain the title of this chapter.
[161]  We always have things in our hands prior to God's speaking, and we always have many things in our hands before the outer man is broken.
[162]  As soon as our outer man is bound, our spirit becomes bound as well.
[163]  The spirit cannot bypass the outer man to operate in others.
[164]  Nor does God allow our spirit to bypass our outer man when it operates in others.
[165]  The Holy Spirit never works on man apart from man, and our spirit can never work on man apart from our outer man.
[166]  If our spirit does not have a way to go on, the Holy Spirit does not have a way to go on either.
[167]  If the Lord grants us the grace and breaks our outer man, we will become a person adept at exercising our spirit, and we will be able to release it whenever we want to.
[168]  We do not become qualified for God's work simply by learning some doctrines.
[169]  It is crucial for a worker of the Lord to be able to know men.
[170]  When a person comes to us, we have to know his spiritual condition.
[171]  We have to know what he is saying with his mouth and what he is really saying in his heart, and what is the difference between the two.
[172]  If the Spirit of God shows our spirit the condition of those who come to us, we will be able to give them a suitable word.
[173]  When a doctor diagnoses a patient, he needs the help of many instruments.
[174]  The less we learn, that is, the less price we pay and the more we hold back ourselves, our pride, our narrowness, our opinions, and our joy, the less useful we will be.
[175]  In order to know the condition of a patient, we have to consider this matter from two sides: From the side of the patient and from our side.
[176]  If we want to know a person's sickness, we have to find the most conspicuous and unusual point about him.
[177]  We can say that a man has a frivolous spirit or a downtrodden spirit, etc. What is the source of all of these spiritual conditions? For example, when we say that the spirit is stubborn, where does this stubbornness come from? When we say that the spirit is proud, where does this pride come from? When we say that the spirit is wild, where does this wildness come from? A normal spirit has no characteristic of its own.
[178]  We speak of a stubborn spirit, a proud spirit, a haughty spirit, an unforgiving spirit, a jealous spirit, etc., because the outer man has not been separated from the inner man.
[179]  When we say that a spirit is stubborn, we mean that the inner man of that person has assumed the characteristics of the stubborn outer man.
[180]  When we say that a spirit is proud, we mean that the inner man of that person has been covered with the proud outer man.
[181]  When we say that a spirit is jealous, we mean that the inner man of that person has been shrouded with the jealousy of the outer man.
[182]  What must we do before we can know the condition of man's spirit?
[183]  All of the discipline we receive from the Holy Spirit is a lesson from God.
[184]  When we find that we can touch a brother with our spirit, it does not mean that we can touch every brother with our spirit, nor does it mean that we can touch every spiritual aspect of a brother with our spirit.
[185]  It only means that as we have been disciplined by the Holy Spirit and broken in a certain aspect, we are able to touch a brother in that same aspect.
[186]  If we have not been broken by the Lord in a certain matter and our spirit is insensitive or unprofitable in that matter, we cannot minister to the brother's need.
[187]  After we are dealt with by the Lord and have learned our basic lessons, our spirit will be released, and we will be able to use our spirit to touch other brothers, and we will know their condition.
[188]  Here we should discuss some practical steps in learning to know men.
[189]  In order to touch others' spirit, we have to let them speak.
[190]  CHAPTER FIVE THE CHURCH AND THE WORK OF GOD
[191]  If we truly know the meaning of God's work, we will have to acknowledge that the outer man is indeed a great hindrance.
[192]  After the outer man is broken, how does a man approach God's Word, how does he serve as a minister of His word, and how does he preach the gospel?
[193]  One undeniable fact in studying God's Word is that the kind of person we are determines the kind of Bible we have in our hands.
[194]  If we want to meet the Lord through the Bible, our rebellious and uncooperative mind must be broken.
[195]  When we stand up to speak, an experienced person, after five to ten minutes of our speaking, knows whether we are quoting Scriptures with our mind or whether our thoughts are merged with the thoughts of the Bible.
[196]  If our outer man is broken and our spirit is released, our thoughts will not only become one with the thoughts of the Bible, but our whole being will touch the very Spirit that is behind the writing of the Bible.
[197]  If our spirit is not released and we are cut off from the spirit of the authors of the Bible, we will never understand God's Word; the Bible will be a dead book to us.
[198]  On the one hand, God wants us to understand His Word this is the beginning of His work.
[199]  On the other hand, He desires to place one or two words in our spirit.
[200]  These words become a burden to us, and He desires that we minister these one or two words to the church.
[201]  Many people have the wrong concept that a man believes in the gospel because he has heard the right teachings, or because he is touched in his emotion.
[202]  In order for our outer man to be broken, we need to consecrate ourselves to the Lord.
[203]  It is only an expression of our intention to willingly give ourselves unconditionally, unreservedly, and unequivocally to God.
[204]  For example, prayer is a means of receiving grace because we can go to God and receive grace through prayer.
[205]  When we look back and examine our experience of the various means of grace, we will get an idea of how much we have gone on with God.
[206]  If we realize that all of God's arrangements are for our highest good, including those things that bring us embarrassment, and if we are willing to give ourselves to God in this way, we will find the Holy Spirit dealing with us in many things.
[207]  The Lord deals with them in those particular things.
[208]  Sometimes, we can say that we do not have the opportunity to listen to a message, but we can never say that we do not have the opportunity to obey the discipline of the Holy Spirit.
[209]  We can say that we do not have the opportunity to receive the ministry of the word, but we cannot say that we do not have the opportunity to receive the teaching of the Holy Spirit.
[210]  God wants us to see that we are poor, that we have been going against Him, that we have failed, that we have lived in darkness, walked by ourselves, and been proud and arrogant for a long time.
[211]  God not only wants to break our outer man, but also to separate it from the inner man.
[212]  He wants to dismantle our outer man so that our outer man does not become an encumbrance to the inner man.
[213]  He wants our spirit and our soul, that is, our inner man and our outer man, to be separated from each other.
[214]  The outer man needs to be broken before the spirit can be released.
[215]  But when the spirit is released, it must not be mixed with the sentiments and characteristics of the outer man.
[216]  If a man has never been enlightened by God or judged by Him in a deep way, thereby gaining a knowledge of his outer man, the release of his spirit naturally will be accompanied by his outer man.
[217]  If our outer man is not condemned, what will be exposed as soon as we come in contact with others will be the most conspicuous element of the outer man.
[218]  If we have never been touched by God in a fundamental way, we may act somewhat spiritual when we remember to do it, but we will manifest the self once our memory slips.
[219]  Hebrews 4:12-13 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[220]  The last part of verse 13 can be translated as "all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him who judges us" or "all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the Lord; the Lord is our Judge."
[221]  We often concede that something is of our outer man, that it is of the soul, of the flesh, and is fleshly.
[222]  We concede that it is something that originates from ourselves.
[223]  Yet even as we are saying this, we do not see this matter in actuality.
[224]  When God grants us mercy and enlightens us, He will speak to us in a serious and sober way, as if to say, "This is it!
[225]  We say that we love the Lord, but when God's light shines on us, we will see that we did not love the Lord at all but instead only loved ourselves.
[226]  If we try to discern doctrinally what is of the self, what is of the Lord, what is of the flesh, what is of the Holy Spirit, what is of the Lord's grace, what is of the outer man, and what is of the inner man, we can spell out a long list and can even memorize the list, but we will still be in darkness.
[227]  Hebrews 4:13 continues, saying, "And there is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are to give our account."
[228]  Here the Lord shows us the standard by which He enlightens us and discerns our thoughts and intentions.
[229]  To what extent do our eyes have to be opened before we can say that we have a revelation?
[230]  Revelation is God opening our eyes to see our intentions and the deepest thoughts in our being as God sees them.
[231]  If God is merciful to us and grants us a little revelation, if we see a little of ourselves as God sees us, and if He reveals to us a little of what we are like, we will immediately fall on our face before the Lord.
[232]  What we have seen under the light will be rejected by us again when things, words, or intentions of a similar nature arise a second time; we immediately will see that what we are faced with is the same thing that we were trying to deal with the first time.
[233]  It shows us how much of what we thought was good is actually not good, how much of what we thought was right is actually wrong, how much of what we thought was spiritual is actually soulish, and how much of what we thought was of God is actually of ourselves.
[234]  Whether or not we can be a worker of the Lord depends not on what we say or do but on what comes out of us.
[235]  If we say and do one thing, yet what comes out of us is another thing, others will not receive help.
[236]  Sometimes we say that we have a good impression of a certain person, or that we have a bad impression of another person.
[237]  If it does, then we would say that a person is good if his words are good and that he is bad if his words are bad; there would not be the need to talk about impression at all.
[238]  The Spirit deals with our outer man by these two means: discipline and shining.
[239]  We have these two main things before us the Spirit's discipline and God's shining, or we can say the Spirit's revelation.
[240]  CHAPTER NINE PLIABLENESS AFTER THE BREAKING PLIABLENESS AND THE BREAKING OF THE WILL
[241]  God uses many ways to break our outer man, and these ways vary from person to person.
[242]  This is the reason the Holy Spirit directs different kinds of disciplining works to different persons.
[243]  God allows them to fail again and again in order that they learn not to trust in their own wisdom, until they say, "I live not by man's wisdom but by the mercy of God."
[244]  Once a man is broken by the Holy Spirit, he will manifest a pliableness that comes from a fear of God.
[245]  When others contact him, they no longer will find him as hard, fierce, and severe as before.
[246]  The greatest help that we can receive does not come simply from the correction of our mistakes.
[247]  The greatest help comes as our outer man is broken and our spirit becomes open and free.
[248]  Our spirit will not only be released; it also will receive spiritual help wherever we go.
[249]  If our outer man is not broken, it will be hard for us to receive any help from anyone.
[250]  Fellowship is not a communication of the mind with the mind or an exchange of opinions; it is the contact of spirit with spirit.
[251]  When our spirit touches another brother's spirit, that contact of the spirit is fellowship.
[252]  It is only as we receive mercy from the Lord to break the outer shell and to tear down the outer man that our spirit is released.
[253]  Only then will we touch the spirits of the brothers and sisters, and only then will we understand the meaning of fellowship with the saints.
[254]  From that point forward we will understand what the Bible means when it speaks of the fellowship of the spirit.
[255]  If God removes our barriers and our outer man is dismantled, our spirit will be open to all men.
[256]  If our outer man is broken and our inner man released, we will touch the spirit of the church, and we will be more useful to the Lord.
[257]  All outward imitations are not God's work; they are man's work.
[258]  Therefore, every seeking person should learn the inward lessons, not the outward imitations.
[259]  As we give ourselves to imitations and artificiality, we will gradually be led to believe that we are what we pretend to be.
[260]  Even if others point out that we do not have anything real and that we have to get rid of it, we will still wonder whether their words are true.
