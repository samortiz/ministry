We need to see the Body of Christ from the angle which is revealed in the book of Ephesians. A number of teachers of the Bible have said that the book of Ephesians is a book on the church. But we need to see that Ephesians is not merely on the church but on the church as the Body of Christ. Ephesians 1:22-23 says that Christ was made Head over all things to the church, which is His Body. Ephesians stresses the Body of Christ.</P><P>Today even the non-Christians are familiar with the term church, and they, along with many Christians, think that the church is a physical building with a bell tower. They say that they are going to church or are in church, referring to a physical building. They do not know that the church is not a physical building but the Body of Christ. We need to see what the Body of Christ is. According to Ephesians, the Body of Christ is something so mysterious that we cannot comprehend it with our natural understanding.</P><P>If someone were to ask us what the Body of Christ is, we might only be able to tell them that the Body of Christ is the church. If they went on to ask us what the church is, we might only be able to tell them that the church is the gathering of the people called out by God from the world. Of course, this is true, but this is not the Body of Christ revealed in the book of Ephesians.</P>
