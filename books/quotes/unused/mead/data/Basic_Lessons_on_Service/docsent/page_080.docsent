   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. If Any Man's Work Is Consumed,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He Will Suffer Loss</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 15 says, "If anyone's work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Wood, grass, and stubble are not good for building materials but good for being burned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today many Christians are producing fuel for a burning to come.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more they do, the more they have something for burning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If anyone's work is consumed, he will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Loss here means that he will lose the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He will lose the richer, higher, and greater enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Word says clearly, however, that he himself will be saved, yet he will be saved as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates some kind of punishment and discipline, not just a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We saw in the previous lesson that we must avoid anything of strange fire in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Also, all the work of wood, grass, and stubble must be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must build with gold, silver, and precious stone.</S>
