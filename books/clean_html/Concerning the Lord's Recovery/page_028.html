<P>You have to put aside your culture, your religion, your ethical thought, and your tradition. Take off all these layers of veils. Some condemn this matter of the coinherence because they are blinded by their religious veils. Their blindness keeps them in darkness. They talk about religion and theology and the Bible in darkness.</P><P>What about culture? Galatians 3:27 and 28 say, "For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus." Those who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ, and they are all one. In this oneness there is no Jew and no Greek, there is no slave and no free man. This means there is no culture.</P><P>What about ethics? In Philippians 3 Paul tells us that he pursued Christ alone. It was not a matter of his own righteousness according to the law (Phil. 3:9). That is ethics. When you keep the commandment of the law to be moral and good, that is ethics. That had been Paul's pursuit in the past, but after he was saved his pursuit was a living Person, Christ. He was not pursuing the righteousness according to the law, but the living righteousness, which is the righteousness of God by faith, that is Christ the Person Himself.</P><P>In Galatians 1:14 Paul also told us that he was exceedingly zealous of the tradition of his fathers. This means he was zealous for the Jew's inherited tradition. But one day on the way to Damascus the Lord met him and knocked him down. From that day Paul began to know, not tradition, but a living Person. Paul did not pursue culture but the living Christ. He did not care for religion but the living Son of God. He was not zealous for ethics but the very Christ as his righteousness. He was Paul's righteousness and justification and sanctification. He was everything to Paul. He did not have ethics, but he was full of Christ. He did not have tradition; he had a present Christ, a living Christ, an up-to-date Christ.</P><P>Dear saints, this is the expression of God which to some extent has been lost, missed, neglected, and even opposed by today's Christianity. I know that I came from China, but my teaching is not Chinese, nor is it something of man. My teaching is just a quotation of the Holy Word. If you honor His Word, you surely would appreciate this kind of teaching. I don't care for the American pleasures and sports and entertainment and weekends. I only care for the Triune God, for the living Christ, and for the Holy Word. I don't care for theology or any creed. I only care for the living God with His living Son and His living Word.</P>
