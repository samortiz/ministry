   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church as the Body of Christ is the issue of God the Son s dispensing, speaking forth the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose Eph 1:7-12: We were redeemed by God in and unto Christ, who is the element of the Divine Trinity; Christ s being the element means that He is for dispensing to accomplish God s economy to head up all things in Christ vv.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>10, 22-23.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The transmitting of Christ is for the sudden raising up of God s churches Eph 1:19-23: Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see the fourfold surpassing greatness of God s power resurrecting power, ascending power, subjecting power, and heading-up power v. 17: Christ overcame four layers of opposition by transcending through Hades, the earth, the air, and even the third heaven Matt 16:18; Acts 2:24; Eph 1:21; Heb 4:14; 7:26.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ transcended far above all the layers of trouble to transmit not only His authority but also His transcending power to the church that the church may be formed Eph 1:19, 22-23.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sudden raising up of God s churches over the whole earth is because of the transmission of the transcending Christ: The fine dispensing in the Lord s dealings with us constitutes the Body of Christ, whereas His transmitting brings forth the Body of Christ: Christ as the Spirit of life is gradually dispensing Himself as the element of God s riches for the growth, the building up, of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ as the Spirit of power is striking suddenly to raise up the churches of God for the spread, the increase, of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His transmission is like that of a rushing violent wind to set up the churches, which are the Body of Christ Acts 2:2: On the day of Pentecost, such a step was taken by the ascended Christ to have a sudden strike among the human race vv.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This sudden striking brings the churches into being and makes them transcendent over all the four layers of persons, matters, and things which oppose the raising up of God s churches cf.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>4:19-31.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since the transcending Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, His transcending transmission includes all the rich threefold dispensing of the Triune God Eph 3:20-21; Phil 4:13.</S>
