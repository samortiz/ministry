   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Mark 1:14-15; John 3:3, 5; Col 1:13 The kingdom of God is a divine sphere for God to work out His plan; it is a realm where God can exercise His authority to accomplish what He intends Mark 1:15; John 3:3, 5; Matt 12:28; Rev 11:15: The kingdom of God is the ruling, the reigning, of God with all its blessing and enjoyment Mark 1:15; Col 1:13.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The kingdom of God is not only God s reign over the universe in a general way by His authority and power but also God s reign in a particular way in the sense of life John 3:5, 15; Rom 8:2, 6, 10-11, 14.</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From God s point of view, the kingdom is the development of God Himself as the seed of life; from the point of view of God s enemy, the kingdom is the subduing of rebellion Mark 4:26-27; Matt 12:28.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fundamental problem in the universe is rebellion against the authority of God Isa 14:12-14: Satan intends to violate God s sovereignty, usurp God s authority, overthrow God s throne, and establish his own kingdom Matt 12:26; Eph 2:2.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God commands everyone to repent for the kingdom Matt 3:2; 4:17; Acts 17:30: To repent means that originally we were rebellious and against God, but now we turn back to the Lord in submission Matt 3:2; 4:17.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Repentance is mainly for us to enter into the kingdom of God; unless we repent that is, have a change of concept we cannot enter into the kingdom Mark 1:15; Matt 3:2; 4:17.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As believers in Christ, we have been regenerated to enter into the kingdom of God as the realm of the divine species to live under the rule of God in life, light, and love John 3:3, 5, 15-16; Col 1:12-13: The kingdom of God is a divine realm to be entered into, a realm that requires the divine life; hence, the unique way to enter into the kingdom of God is to receive God as life and to gain God Himself; this is regeneration John 3:3, 5, 15; 1 John 5:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have been born into the kingdom of God, and now the divine life in our spirit knows the kingdom of God John 3:5-6.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The kingdom of God into which we have entered through regeneration is a realm of the divine species; we have entered into this divine realm by being born of God to become children of God, God-men, who have the life and nature of God 1:12-13; 3:3, 5.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through regeneration we have been transferred into the delightful kingdom of the Son of God s love a realm where we are ruled in love with life; the kingdom in which we find ourselves today is a realm full of life, light, and love Col 1:12-13; 1 Pet 2:9.</S>
