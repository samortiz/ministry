   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Being Freed from All Sects and Denominations</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Recovering the Oneness of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we rose up to take the way of the Lord s recovery by absolutely obeying the word of God, we read from the Word that the situation of division into sects and denominations is not right; it is not according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we all left our respective sects and denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1932, when we began to meet as the church in Chefoo, Shantung Province, there were eleven brothers present for the first three Lord s table meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These eleven brothers came from at least six or eight denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This shows how prevailing was the matter of leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time we truly had a spirit of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We did not care that one brother was baptized by immersion and another was baptized by sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also did not care that one brother was from the China Inland Mission, another from the Presbyterian Church, and still another from the Chinese Christian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we sat around the Lord s table, it was seldom that we did not shed tears.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all felt grateful to the Lord that even though we were previously divided by the denominations, we were now breaking the Lord s bread together to testify of the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This may be considered the second point of the recovery among us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. Abandoning All Rank and Systems</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and Recovering the Position of All the Saints Being Brothers to One Another</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time we also abandoned rank and systems and recovered the position of all the saints being brothers to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time, calling each other brother was very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Previously in the Christian denominations in China, the believers called each other chiaoyu, meaning religious friend.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, they would say Chiaoyu Chang, Chiaoyu Lee, or Chiaoyu Liu ; they never used the intimate term brother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, at that time we changed and called each other brother.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we met, we called each other brother; it was sweet and intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, we rejected all rank; we had no pastors, no priests, and even more, no bishops.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We abandoned the priestly system in the Roman Catholic Church, the clergy system in the state churches, and the pastoral system in the private churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We lived together before the Lord as brothers under the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>D. Being Separated from the World</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>and Staying Away from Idols</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We practiced two more points, that is, being separated from the world and staying away from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were completely separated from the world, and we stayed far away from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We absolutely did not want to have any part in anything contaminated by the world and idols.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>E. Completely Taking Christ as the Head</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>and Allowing the Holy Spirit to Rule</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, we completely took Christ as the Head and allowed the Holy Spirit to rule among us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All intermediary classes and all forms of organization were eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every believer, and every church as well, lived directly before Christ, the Head, and allowed the Holy Spirit to govern and direct in all matters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>F. Taking the Locality</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>as the Boundary of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Each Locality Having Only One Church</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1933 and 1934 we clearly saw a crucial matter the principle of the church taking a locality as its boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time, in many places there were brothers who rose up to meet together, but there was a question concerning the boundary of each of these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How should the boundary be delimited?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Concerning this matter, a certain brother, after spending much effort in studying the Bible, found that the church takes a locality as its ground and boundary; that is, he saw the light of one locality, one church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Jerusalem there was one church, in Antioch there was one church, and in Ephesus there was one church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In a large city the church was one; also in a small city the church was one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church in a large city did not divide into several churches; also the churches in several smaller cities did not unite to form one church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was only one church in a large city such as Jerusalem, and there was also only one church in a small city such as Thessalonica.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In every case, there was one locality, one church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Based on this principle, from 1934 onward, no matter how large or how small a city is, we have taken the way of having only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On one hand, this prevents division and confusion; on the other hand, it also prevents extra-local unions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If one locality were united with another locality, it would cause Christ to lose His position and the Holy Spirit to lose His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not pleasing to the Lord, and it is most offensive to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to the teaching of the Bible, the church in each locality should live directly before the Lord and be responsible to the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There should be no superior church, no head church, and no federation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All local churches, whether large or small, are equal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The lowest church is the local church; the highest church is also the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is only one class of churches; there is not a second class.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When there is a ranking system among the churches, the church on a higher level becomes the head and the authority of a church on a lower level, thereby usurping the position of Christ and encroaching on the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because we saw this clear light from the Bible, the churches in various localities absolutely would not form a union.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No locality can control another locality; rather, every locality allows Christ to be the Head and the Holy Spirit to exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the other hand, all the churches love one another, fellowship with one another, minister to one another, and help one another in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is something spiritual and of love; it is not organizational or formal.</S>
