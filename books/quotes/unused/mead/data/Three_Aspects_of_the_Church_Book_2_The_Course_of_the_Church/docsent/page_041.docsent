   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A careful study of church history and spiritual biographies shows that although Martin Luther formally brought the church out of Catholicism, there were still many spiritual people in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thomas Kempis was such a person; he lived before the time of Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After Luther, from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, there were many spiritual people in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, Madame Guyon lived in the seventeenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Madame Guyon s position was similar to that of the mystics, but the line of the mystics did not begin with her.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even before Madame Guyon, many people were living before God; these were not small in number.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the Roman Catholic Church persecuted them, they remained in Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some things were recovered by those in the realm of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Protestantism recovered justification by faith, but those in the Roman Catholic Church recovered the knowledge of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Aside from these two items, in more than a hundred years between Luther in the sixteenth century and Madame Guyon in the seventeenth century, there were no other clear recoveries only a general recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first recovery was justification by faith, and the second recovery was the knowledge of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Madame Guyon is representative of those who recovered the knowledge of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They paid attention to the inner fellowship with God and to living before Him; historians call them the mystics.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Among them, Father Fenelon is very famous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There were many others, but there is little record of them because they were hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, George M ller founded orphanages, but one of his contemporaries also founded orphanages and even took in more orphans than M ller did.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, this person never released a yearly report, as M ller did.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although M ller never asked for donations, he would send out a yearly report to let the believers know the situation with his orphans.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet others also were practicing to live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we enter the kingdom, we will discover that there were many hidden ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Madame Guyon has been overly promoted, and her books are in almost every country.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While she did have some knowledge of life, there were many things from her Catholic background that should have been eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although Luther reformed the church, it seems that God left the recovery of the knowledge of life within the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was God s reaction to the condition of Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Throughout the centuries, God s work has been in reaction to man s move; if we do something improper, God will react to what we have done.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, the Reformation was a reaction to Catholicism; the recovery of the knowledge of life within Catholicism, however, was a reaction to the legalism and formalism of Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even today, many Catholics live before God; they despise Protestantism because it places too much emphasis on outward forms and is ignorant of the inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although these Catholics who live before God acknowledge that the Roman Catholic Church emphasizes outward forms, they believe that there are many like them in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that at least a small number in Catholicism are living before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The epistle to the church in Thyatira in Revelation 2:18-29 shows that there is a group called the rest within the church in Thyatira who are overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should never think that all the overcomers are in the Protestant churches; there are overcomers in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God let the recovery of the inner life take place in Catholicism in order to show that the Reformation could not meet His need on the earth and that Protestantism does not meet the standard of His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The recovery of justification by faith was a great thing; the recovery of the knowledge of life was also a great thing.</S>
