   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION SIX THE GROANING OF THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>8:1-14 I. THE GROANING FOR DELIVERANCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FROM THE FLESH 8:1-4</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The deeper a believer is in union with the Lord and the more he comes up to the standard of the maiden, the more he will be aware of his outward man and the shell of his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is true that the inward man is renewed day by day, but the outer man is also decaying day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the Holy Spirit gives life to the mortal body, the body itself is still destined to die.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although God's power is made perfect in our weakness, the body is still a thorn to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the more a believer advances, and the more spiritual and heavenly he becomes, the more he will be aware of the limitation of the flesh in spite of his present perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He will feel that even though he has the firstfruits of the Spirit, there will be the inevitable groanings within in addition to the groanings of the whole creation for the redemption of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we live by the flesh, we do not feel the need for the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When our union with the Lord has become very nearly perfect, we sense the difference between our inward state and our outward body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the condition of the body does not constitute a hindrance, at the very least it constitutes a weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At this time the redemption of the body becomes a necessary grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Song of Songs 8:1 says, "O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The maiden is saying to the Lord, in effect, "I wish I could become more intimately related to You than I am today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I wish that You were my brother in the flesh, and that my relationship with You before God could be manifested immediately before men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When this happens, I will not be despised when I confess You before men and when I acknowledge my love before others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since I am still in the world, I still feel weakness in me, and I cannot treat You as my heart wishes to treat You.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the beginning I was after Your kisses; I was after You and Your expression of love to me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now I desire to kiss You, to express my love to You, and to satisfy You.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But there is a barrier, the barrier of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have not revealed Yourself as my brother yet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, while I remain in the world, I cannot help but think that I have not served You as I should have served."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 2 says, "I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She continues to say, "When that day comes, it will be as if I am leading You into the heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I will forever be taught of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All my fruits today are for the making of the sweet wine of that day, which will serve as Your eternal joy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>None of the spiritual fruits I have received from You will be for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On that day all the pomegranates will be turned into spiced wine for Your satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I will give everything I have to You, and everything I have will be for Your enjoyment."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 3 says, "His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She continues to say, "On that day, His left hand will be under my head, and He will lift up my face to behold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His right hand will embrace me, and He will see me face to face within His bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am looking forward to this day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>O that it would come quickly!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 4 says, "I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until she please."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"O daughters of Jerusalem, she is now living in the hope of rapture; she is in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Her feeling at the moment is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no need to arouse her.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not interfere by the hand of flesh, until she wakes up in the countenance of His face."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>BEFORE THE RAPTURE 8:5-14</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 5 says, "Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth; there she brought thee forth that bare thee."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This book speaks of the maiden coming up from the wilderness two times.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first coming up from the wilderness in 3:6 refers to her forsaking of a wandering life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There she began her absolute union with the Lord in His death, His life, and all His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since then she steadily advanced, until she left the wilderness completely.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although in her latter experience she stopped once or twice, we dare not say that these stops were necessary, but surely we can say that they were excusable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once we leave the wandering life, we leave it for good.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why then does the Lord speak about her coming up from the wilderness a second time, as if she is still in the wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must pay attention to what the wilderness refers to.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The wilderness for us is not just a wandering life, but the world itself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not only is there a wilderness in the spiritual realm; there is also a wilderness in the fleshly realm.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must not only be delivered spiritually from the wilderness of wandering, but we must be delivered from this earthly wilderness as well.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the Lord reigns within us through the Holy Spirit, we begin to leave behind a fluctuating life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we hear the call for the rapture, we will be delivered from the worldly environment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The cross of Christ delivers us from the spiritual wilderness, and the coming of Christ delivers us from the earthly wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is why there is a second coming up from the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is being delivered from this earth.</S>
