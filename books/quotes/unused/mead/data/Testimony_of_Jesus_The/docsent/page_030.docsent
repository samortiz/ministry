   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNIVERSAL, HEAVENLY, AND BRIGHT WOMAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following this, chapter 12 reveals the third aspect of the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here the figure is not a lampstand but a wonderful, universal, heavenly woman vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1-2, 5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whereas the lampstands are in the dark night, the woman is full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With her there is no distinction between day and night, because she is clothed with the sun, the moon is underneath her feet, and on her head is a crown of stars.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no need for the woman to shine in the darkness, as the lampstands do, because she is always fully in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we come to the lampstands, we are under the shining, and when we come to the woman, we are under the sun, the moon, and the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sun, the moon, and the stars are all heavenly Gen 1:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the woman indicates the heavenly nature, position, and disposition of the church as the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With her there is nothing earthly, such as casinos, department stores, television, sports, synagogues, cathedrals, or chapels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything about this woman is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some gatherings of Christians can be compared to a dark cell deep in the earth, having no openings for the light and being full of dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they meet together, they talk about fashions, department stores, and worldly places.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The local churches, however, are in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no earth but only the sun, the moon, and the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The earthly dirt is under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christians today sometimes speak about fighting Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, as long as someone is in that dark cell of the world, he can never fight against the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is good only to be Satan s food.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God cursed Satan as the serpent, He condemned him to eat dust 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as we are earthly, we are qualified to be food for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, there is no serpent on the sun, the moon, or the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The position of the church in the spiritual warfare is not on the earth but in the heavenlies Eph 2:6; 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the church is in the heavenlies, Satan is under her feet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, Satan is cast down and defeated by the man-child of the wonderful heavenly woman Rev 12:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In earthly Christian meetings, people are good for Satan s food, but in the proper church life, which is the main part of the heavenly woman, Satan is already defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The best way to defeat Satan in the local churches is to minister the heavenly things to the saints so that the church may remain heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then there will be the victory, and Satan will be cast down.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to our observation, the weakest point with the sisters is gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many young sisters like to gossip about their mothers-in-law, and many older sisters like to gossip about their daughters and daughters-in-law, about who is engaged, married, or pregnant, when the baby will come, and whether it will be a boy or a girl.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such gossip belongs in worldly places, not in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Gossiping causes the church to be dark and opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever the long gossiping tongue is cut off, the church is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many times the love that some of the saints have is a fleshly love, not the love in the spirit that is as clear as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This kind of ugly, fleshly love causes many Christian meetings to be darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the eyes of the Lord, it may be worse than hatred and fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is the love of turtles and serpents, and it should be buried and burned.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, the more people are humble in a natural way, the more they sink into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Again, in the Lord s eyes, soulish humility may be worse than pride.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A sister may say, I dare not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am just a little sister.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What can I say?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am not worthy, but this is only a soulish humility.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because the church is heavenly and crystal clear, we should all be frank in a heavenly way, taking no excuse or cloak, but being what we are in the Lord and in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To cloak ourselves is to pretend to be something that we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The heavenly woman wears no cloak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is crystal clear and frank, having no pretense, excuse, cloak, or covering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With her, everything is in the open.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nice words are often a cloak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many times, certain dear saints came to me to speak nice words.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Right away my spirit told me, This is a falsehood, and these nice words are a cheating.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not deal in this way with the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nothing exposes people as much as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church life is the strongest x-ray.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Someone may come to us speaking good things, but if we are in the spirit, the x-ray within may see the workings of their mind and that those words are a cheating.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Several times I told someone, Please do not come to cheat me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I hear your words, but my spirit sees what is in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the church is heavenly, everything will be in the open.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The wonderful, bright woman has no covering, shadow, or darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Everything is in the bright open air.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This kind of church is a victorious one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this sense, there is no need for the church to fight against Satan; Satan is already defeated and cast down, and the kingdom of Christ is brought in. This woman is heavenly, bright, frank, and thoroughly crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is from such a wonderful church that the man-child is brought forth v. 5a . This woman is the third aspect of the church as the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>THE MAN-CHILD</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The man-child is the stronger part of the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Among the people of God, even among those in the Lord s recovery today, there is the stronger part.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The woman will be left on earth to pass through the great tribulation, but the stronger part, the man-child, will be raptured to the throne of God before the tribulation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>5b-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The man-child will be raptured prior to the tribulation because God needs the man-child to fight against Satan in the heavens and cast him down to the earth v. 9 . Although God has many angels who will fight against Satan, the final victory over the enemy will be gained not because of the angels but because of the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God needs the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God will shame Satan by using the very man Satan corrupted to defeat him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God may say, Satan, you have corrupted the man I created, but I have produced a man-child out of this corrupted man to defeat you, not only on the earth but also in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The man-child will fight up to the throne to cast Satan down from the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although Jesus has defeated Satan on the cross, there is still the need for the church to execute His victory over the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Because many members of the Body have failed in this matter, only the stronger part of the Body, the man-child, will execute Christ s victory over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The man-child will be raptured to the heavens to accomplish this job.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The rapture is not mainly for our own blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should not merely say, How good it is for me to be raptured to the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must realize that God has a need for us to be raptured; we must be raptured to heaven to fight against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If someone hears this and says, I don t want to go to the heavens and be involved in a war, this means that he is not qualified to be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If anyone does not go to heaven to meet Satan and cast him down, Satan will come down to the earth to meet and overcome him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must be the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I earnestly desire to be a part of the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I am not satisfied simply to be a part of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I want to be included in that stronger part.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This also is an aspect of the testimony of Jesus.</S>
