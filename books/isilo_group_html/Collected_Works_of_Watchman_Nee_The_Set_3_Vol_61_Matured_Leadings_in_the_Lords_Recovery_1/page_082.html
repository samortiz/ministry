This means to inspect and supervise things from a height. All the brothers and sisters are working, and these ones are observing. No one can escape their eyesight. They know as soon as someone moves. They know who is loving the world, who is naughty, and who is in sin. They know who is not honest and greedy for material things, but their job is not just to look, but to help those who err. As soon as a brother gets into trouble, the elders have to adjust him and render him help immediately.</p><p>Moreover, in the church, every brother and sister should be serving. Every member should exercise his function. The elders should not replace others' work while they are exercising the overseership; they should only oversee them in their work. They must not be the only ones who are occupied but must make many other brothers and sisters busy. Good overseers must know how to initiate and must know how to bring all the brothers and sisters into the work. They have to remember that they are overseers; they are not replacement workers. They have to work with the brothers and sisters, not work for them.</p><p>An elder must devote his time to his work. If a hundred brothers and sisters are working and one among them is an elder, he has to devote his time to oversee the rest. He has to ensure that they are indeed working and that no one is standing idle. He has to be like the master of the vineyard who stands at the gate to observe everything. He has to make sure that no one is lazy. He has to equip everyone to serve, whether in physical chores or in spiritual matters. Everyone needs to see that he cannot be idle. If everyone does this, the gospel will spread in a prevailing way.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL THE ONE-TALENTED ONES<br />HANDING THEMSELVES OVER TO SERVE THE LORD</h2><p>If we label one brother as useless and another sister as unsuitable, sooner or later all the brothers and sisters will become useless and only we will be useful. We have to perfect others to serve. We have to make the useless ones useful. The church is the Body of Christ, and all the brothers and sisters are members of this Body. We cannot call anyone useless. The Lord does give some five-talented ones to the church, but we must remember that the church is not built upon five-talented gifts or two-talented gifts. The chief factor in the building up of the church is the one-talented ones. There are not too many five-talented ones in the church; perhaps, we can only find one in a few centuries. There are also very few two-talented ones. It would be hard for the church to be built up with five-talented ones. In the past we paid too much attention to the five- and two-talented ones. As a result, all the one- talented ones were buried. The way of the church today is to have all the one-talented ones dig up their one talent.</p><p>Today we are not afraid that the Lord would only give one-talented members to the church. We can ask Him to give us more of these members. As long as we all dig up our one talent, the church will have a way to go on. Today it is hard to find a five-talented one, but five of the least gifted ones will add up to five talents. The church is not short of men. The service of the church is manifested when all the one- talented ones are mobilized, when the whole Body rises up to preach and serve. Thank the Lord that His Word tells us clearly that no saved person has less than a talent. We all have at least one talent. Luke 19 says that we all have at least a mina. Matthew 25 says that we all have at least one talent. Everyone who serves the Lord has at least one talent of gift. No one has less than a mina; no one has less than one talent. We can only excuse ourselves by saying that we have not offered up our one talent. We cannot tell the Lord that we do not have one talent. Even the slave who was judged evil and slothful handed one talent back to the Lord, not half a talent.</p><p>An elder does not replace the brothers and sisters with his greater gifts. His function lies in bringing out the one talent that lies within all the members. No matter how capable and gifted an elder is, his contribution can never match the functioning of the one-talented ones. It is wrong for two or three highly gifted elders to do the work of the whole church. The result would be much better if these two or three elders stepped aside and the whole church stepped in to do the work. The Lord has given every saved person at least one talent. If we say that we have received less than a talent, then we must not be saved. Since we have a talent, we should serve in the capacity of a one-talented member. This is the reason the elders must exercise overseership. They must not allow anyone to bury his one talent in the ground. When I come to Hong Kong again and see people burying their talent, I will not rebuke them; I will rebuke the elders.</p><p>Whether or not a church can go on depends on whether all the one-talented ones are mobilized. I am shouting here: All the one-talented ones have to be mobilized! No power on earth can withstand the force of all the one-talented ones rising up together. No matter how "useless" a person seems to be, every person has to be used. We have to use everyone, unless we have the thought that some members in Christ's Body are lame.</p><p>One characteristic of Brother Witness is that he can use a person, no matter how "useless" they think they are. If they do not know how to do certain things, he will take them by the hand and teach them. Every smart and gifted person likes to do things by himself, but this requires him to pay a high price. If one is truly wise, he should stir up the one- talented ones to dig up their talent from the earth. He has to make everyone busy. The elders should be very sensitive in their spirit; they should be able to detect buried talents and should encourage them to be dug out. If the responsible brothers do not know whether a brother or sister has hidden his or her talent, they must bear the blame.</p><p>May the Lord bless the church so that it would see what it really is. The church is built upon one-talented ones. We do not have to stir up five- and two-talented ones; they rise up by themselves; they do not want to hide their talents. Only the one-talented ones have a danger of hiding their talents. In order for the church to be built up, the one-talented ones have to rise up. No matter how much we have and what kind of persons we are, we have to dig out our talent. When all the one-talented ones rise up, the church will be manifested. Once the church is manifested, the gates of Hades will not overcome it. The gospel will spread throughout the world. If we all pour out our lives, Satan will tremble.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_081.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_083.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 82</div><br></body></html>
