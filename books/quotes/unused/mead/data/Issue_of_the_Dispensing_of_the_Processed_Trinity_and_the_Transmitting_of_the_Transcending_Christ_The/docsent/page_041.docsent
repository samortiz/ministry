   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I believe that in the past five chapters we have seen God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have also seen that the way to carry out the Triune God's economy is by His threefold dispensing plus Christ's onefold transmitting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These two things work together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The threefold dispensing produces the many sons and transforms them into God's heritage of worth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This transformation will go on and on through the Spirit's continual sealing until one day the result will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That result will be the transfiguration of our vile body, which will bring all of us into God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the issue of the triune dispensing to produce the materials for the building up of the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then the church comes into existence through the transcending Christ's transcending transmission, and this transmission took place on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the history of the universe, such a marvelous thing took place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suddenly in one day, the church as the Body of Christ came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now the church, the Body of Christ, is here.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today we are enjoying Him in His Body, His church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>IN THE BOOK OF EPHESIANS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before we speak further concerning the Body of Christ, I want to point out something crucial in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In each of the six chapters of Ephesians, the human spirit is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our human spirit has been regenerated and indwelt by the compound, all-inclusive, consummated Spirit to make this spirit a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1:17 the apostle Paul prayed that the Father would give us such a mingled spirit of wisdom to understand and of revelation to see.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need the revelation and the enlightenment to see the mystery of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also need to understand, to apprehend, what we see by the divine wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The economy of God is a real mystery, yet it has been revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can see His economy and it is made known to us so that we can receive it, understand it, apprehend it, and participate in it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 2:22 says that all the believers are being built together to be God's habitation in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God needs a dwelling place, not just in the heavens but on the earth, and this dwelling place must be organic in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This spirit is not the dweller; rather, it is the dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God mingled Himself with our spirit, and our spirit is His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is here dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is in our spirit, which is His resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ephesians 3:5 tells us that the economy of God, which is so mysterious, has been unveiled to the apostles and the prophets in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This revelation was given not in their mind but in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are going to understand, to realize, the reality of God's mysterious economy, we must learn to discern our spirit from our soul Heb 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not be bothered by our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not be troubled, complicated, and perplexed by our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, we should always turn to our spirit where we can meet the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our mingled spirit, we have the capacity to see the mystery of God's economy, to understand it, to apprehend it, and to receive it and retain it as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 4:23 says that we have to be renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our spirit can become the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, the fallen mind is a bad thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are a number of bad things within us, and the leading one is our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to hate our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we exercise our mind too much, we get ourselves "hung on a tree" like Absalom 2 Sam 18:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we have the best thing in us, that is, our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This thing, our spirit, can even go into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our spirit can come into our mind, subdue it, take it over, and occupy it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It can then become the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we have a wonderful mind, a mind that has the spirit within it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is by this spirit of the mind that we are renewed every day into the image of our Creator Col 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Day by day we are being renewed by the spirit who is taking over our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is in this way that we are transformed and conformed to the image of our Creator.</S>
