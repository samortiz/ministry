<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Thousands of Thousands Ministering to Him</H2><P>Thousands of thousands ministered to Him, and ten thousands of ten thousands stood before Him (Dan. 7:10b). This vast number of angels ministered to Him for His service and stood before Him for His glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Court of Judgment Sitting</H2><P>The court of judgment sat, mainly to judge the four human empires signified by the four wild beasts (vv. 10c, 26). A special court, with God's throne as the center, has been set up in the universe to judge the four human empires. Everything that is judged by this court will be cast into the burning fire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN&#151;CHRIST</H2><P>Concerning His judgment, God has given all power and authority to Jesus Christ as the Son of Man (John 5:22). Hence, Daniel 7:13 and 14 describe the coming of the Son of Man&#151;Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Christ Coming Like a Son of Man<br>with the Clouds of Heaven</H2><P>According to verse 13a, Christ came like a Son of Man with the clouds of heaven.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Coming to the Ancient of Days<br>and Being Brought Near before Him</H2><P>The Son of Man, Christ, came to the Ancient of Days and was brought near before Him (v. 13b). The coming here is Christ's ascending.</P><P>Daniel 9:26, referring to the death of Christ on the cross for our redemption, speaks of Messiah's being cut off. This was a great achievement, the work of redemption, accomplished by Christ in His first appearance on earth. After Christ accomplished the work of redemption, He ascended to the heavens.</P><P>This could be mentioned in Daniel 7 because there is no time element with God. In the sight of God, immediately after accomplishing redemption, Christ ascended to the heavens, coming to God to receive the kingdom. This indicates that from God's point of view the kingdom comes right after redemption.</P><P>Daniel did not have any idea concerning the church. Like Abraham, David, and the other prophets, he did not see the mystery of the church which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations. He did not realize that between the first and second appearing of Christ there would be a period of time during which God would do a marvelous and mysterious work based on Christ's redemption. This work is to regenerate His redeemed people and then sanctify them, renew them, transform them, and conform them to the glorious image of Christ. According to Daniel's vision, Christ accomplished redemption and then immediately came to God in ascension to receive the kingdom.</P>
