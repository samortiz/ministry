   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR CHRIST'S INDWELLING Scripture Reading: Gen 1:27; 2 Cor 4:4b; Rom 9:21, 23; 2 Cor 4:6-7; John 14:20, 23; Eph 3:16-17, 19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the preceding chapter we saw the indwelling Christ Christ as the indwelling One who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we want to see Christ's indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We want to know how this indwelling Christ lives in us and what this indwelling is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>CHRIST'S INDWELLING BEING REAL AND INTIMATE THOUGH MYSTERIOUS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know that Christ is truly a mystery, and His indwelling is even more a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even so, Christ's indwelling is very real and intimate because it is not something that takes place outside of us but rather something that transpires within us and is intimately related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, this is a very real and subjective matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>MAN AS A CREATED VESSEL TO CONTAIN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 1:27 tells us that God created man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no other book in the universe that tells us in such a definite way that man was not only created by God but that he was also created in God's own image.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only the Bible tells us explicitly that man was created by God in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man definitely did not evolve from something else.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, man was created by God in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who is God's image?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible tells us that Christ is the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second Corinthians 4:4b says, "Christ, who is the image of God."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ as the Son of God's love "is the image of the invisible God."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, when God created us in the beginning, He created us according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 9:21 tells us that God created us and chose us that we might be vessels to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, we were not only created according to the image of Christ, but we were also created as vessels instead of instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Vessels are different from instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Knives, axes, and saws are instruments for working, whereas glasses and tea cups are vessels for containing something.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God did not create us as instruments to work for Him; instead, He created us as vessels to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Based upon Genesis 1:27, Paul wrote Romans 9:21.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He realized that in the beginning God created man with clay and that this man of clay is a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, this vessel is not for containing milk or water but the God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, in Romans 9:23 Paul said, "In order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This glory denotes God Himself, because in Psalms and Jeremiah we are told that the children of Israel forsook their glory Psa 106:20; Jer 2:11 instead of being told that they forsook their God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To forsake the glory is to forsake God, because God is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without God, the universe and all that is in it has no glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is the source of all glory and splendor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are earthen vessels to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When God comes into us, we become vessels of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man was created by God to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This concept cannot be found in any other book.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Besides the Bible, there is no other book in the world that has such a record.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second Corinthians 4:6 says, "The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This light is the expression of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without glory, there is no brightness shining out, because light is the manifestation of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This glory is God, and the shining forth of light is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God shines in our hearts by Himself as the light of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is just like a camera.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the shutter is open, the image of the beautiful scene with beautiful flowers is exposed on the film through the entrance of light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are a living camera created by God, and within us we have the film, which is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you hear the gospel of the Lord, and if you believe Him in your heart and call upon His name with your mouth, you are a camera with an open shutter, and the film within you is readily exposed to the light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This exposure is everlasting and continuous.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I was exposed to this light on an afternoon fifty-eight years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This exposure has been going on in me for all these years without ceasing, and it cannot be erased.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every Christian has this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our spirit is the film concealed in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the glory of the Lord shines into our heart, our spirit is exposed to the light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At this time Christ as the treasure comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Following verse 6, therefore, 2 Corinthians 4:7 says, "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This treasure is the indwelling Christ who enters into us through the light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our spirit is exposed to the light when we are touched as we hear the gospel of the Lord, testify for the Lord, read the Word, or study spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although we may not be aware of it, this exposure is still working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes we are busy with outward affairs, and we think that the light is fading.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Actually, the light to which we have been exposed still remains in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For that one time of exposure to the light, we not only thank God for His mercy and praise Him for His love today, but in the millennial kingdom and in eternity we will still offer thanksgiving to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This exposure to the light is exceedingly precious.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On that day fifty-eight years ago the Lord Jesus caused me to be exposed to the light, and thus I have Him in me as the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now this treasure is in me, an earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is not a small thing because this is Christ's indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This treasure in us is the Lord Jesus, who is living and constantly speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is a living treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As such, when He comes into us, He always bothers us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is easy for us to put a table in our house.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All we need to do is find a suitable place in the house and put the table there.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But if we bring a vivacious child into our house, he will bring us many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This treasure the Lord Jesus in us is living and troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In spite of this, we still love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is greater and stronger than we are, and He is never careless.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is full of patience and is not prone to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Regardless of how we treat Him, He is not angered.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even when we reject Him, He does not leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the story of Christ's indwelling.</S>
