   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord said to Abraham, "This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir" 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord seemed to be saying to Abraham, "I didn't care for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Neither do I care for this one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There must be a seed born out of yourself, not one of your domestics."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then the Lord said to him, "Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be" 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was at this juncture that Abraham believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 6 says that "he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Abraham's believing was counted to him by the Lord as righteousness, and at that time Abraham was justified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Abraham's having a seed was absolutely not an outward matter but altogether an inward one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Abraham tried to make this an outward matter, for Eliezer was something outside of him, not something out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to see the difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today, not many Christians care for the inward experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most Christians care for the outward experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The things that are taught among Christians today mostly go as far as the end of Genesis 14.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some may argue with this, saying, "Don't they have justification by faith, and is this not in chapter fifteen?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yes, they do have justification by faith, but even this has been made by them an outward thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Abraham was not justified by faith in chapter fourteen when he believed that God was the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God did not count that kind of faith to him as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What kind of faith was it that was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was the faith that believed that God was able to work something into him to bring forth the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Believing that God will supply our daily needs, our daily food, is good, but it is not the kind of faith that is precious in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What kind of faith is precious in God's sight?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The faith that believes that He is able to work Himself into us to bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most Christians today only care for the faith that believes that God can do outward things for them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That kind of faith believes that God is able to give them health, healing, a good job, or a promotion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many Christians only have that kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although that kind of faith is good, it is not the faith that is so dear and precious in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not count that kind of faith as righteousness to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The kind of faith that was counted as righteousness to Abraham was the faith that God was able to work something into him to bring forth a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Genesis 15 Abraham did not believe that God would give him bread and butter, cattle, or more servants.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He believed that God was able to work something into him and bring forth a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What kind of faith do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Most Christians appreciate the faith that believes that God will provide all they need for their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That is the faith that believes in God as the Most High God, as the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps you are thinking that you would be satisfied to have such a faith as that.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After reading the last message, you might have tried to believe in the Most High God, believing that our God is the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But that faith is not the faith that is so dear and precious in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to have the faith that believes that God is working Himself into us, the faith that believes that a heavenly seed will be brought forth by something that has been wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May this matter be inscribed into our being!</S>
