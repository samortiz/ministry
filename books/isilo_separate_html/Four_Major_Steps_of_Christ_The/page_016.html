This means that the Body was baptized in the Holy Spirit already and that this baptism was transmitted by a representative of the Body to new members. Through this kind of transmission, we too may experience what the Body already has. The only need is that we be rightly related to the Body. That is the meaning of the laying on of hands&#151;a right relationship to the Body. Through a representative of the Body laying hands on a new member of the Body, what has already been done to the Body is transmitted to the new member. Even Paul when he was Saul needed a little disciple by the name of Ananias to come and lay hands on him. Did Saul say, "Who are you? You are too small! I must have Peter!" If Saul had done that, he would have been wrong with the Body. This was a test to him&#151;and he passed it! He submitted to the Body, for he would be rightly related to it. Then, Ananias, representing the Body, laid his hands upon this newly saved one. The Holy Spirit of God, like the oil from the head, flowed down to the new member, and he in turn was clothed with the Holy Spirit.</P><P>If we would experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit, we must firstly realize that the Lord has ascended, establishing His Lordship and His Headship. Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost, telling the people: "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ" (Acts 2:36). Because He was established as Lord and Head, He poured down the Spirit of power upon His Body (Acts 2:33).</P><P>Secondly, we must have a right relationship with the Body. Thus we may say to the Head, "Lord, I know Your Body. I am a regenerated member of it and I am rightly related to it. On this standing I claim the baptism in the Holy Spirit already accomplished upon Your Body." Then we will indeed experience the wonderful baptism in the Holy Spirit. If we do not understand the ascension of Christ or have a right standing with the Body, no matter how much we pray and tarry, it will be difficult to have the experience. It is already accomplished. The food is on the table; come and take it!</P><P>Here are two things on the table for us. One is the infilling of the Holy Spirit, and the other is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. If we would be filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly, we must learn to exercise our spirit to have living contact with the living Lord, and we must learn to deny ourselves all the time. I assure you, we will be inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit. If we would experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we must realize that the Lord today is ascended, that He is the Lord and Head of all to the church, and we must stand in a right position in respect to the Body. Then we may claim what the Body already has, and we will be clothed with power from on high. Let us do it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCLUSION</H2><P>The incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the ascension&#151;all these&#151;have already been accomplished. When we accept the crucifixion of Christ, we receive forgiveness, justification, redemption, and much more. When we accept the resurrection of Christ, we are regenerated. When we accept the ascension of Christ, we receive power from on high. All this Christ has already accomplished. They are the items of the good news, the gospel. If we are going to preach the gospel, we should tell people about these four items: His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Then they can receive forgiveness, justification, redemption, regeneration, and the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Inwardly they will be filled with the Spirit of life, and outwardly they will be clothed with the Spirit of power.</P><P>Let us all go to the Lord and pray about this. I do have the assurance that something will happen. Do not be satisfied with the words. This is something we must do. Let us go to the Lord and deal with Him about these matters. We must be clear where we are today. We need to be born again with the Holy Spirit, filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit as life, and clothed outwardly with the Holy Spirit as power. Then we will be those who are filled with the triune God and clothed with the triune God. We will be saturated and mingled with Him, and we will be living and functioning members of the Body of Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
