I have no doubt that Christ is in the heavens, and I can give you the Scripture verses which tell us this. But the New Testament also tells us many times that Christ is in us and we are in Him. The book of Ephesians mentions repeatedly that Christ is in us and we are in Christ. I regret to say, however, that in today's Christianity there is a lot of talk about Christ in the heavens but very little talk about Christ in us. No matter how great the quantity is of good oranges in Southern California, they will not do you any good unless they get into your stomach. Only the oranges which you have taken into your stomach are yours. Similarly, no matter how good Christ is in the heavenlies, if He is not in you, He has nothing to do with you. He must be subjective to you. You must have a subjective Christ.</P><P>Some people may say that we need to be balanced. But we need to consider whether we need to be balanced objectively or subjectively. There is too much of the objective Christ in Christianity today, but there is very little of the subjective Christ in you. You have to be balanced on the subjective side, not on the objective side. Christ is already in the heavens. Now there is a great need for you to receive Him into you. You have to be balanced in this way. You do not have enough Christ within you. You may have the gifts, but I wish to ask you, "How much Christ do you have today? How much Christ do you have in your daily life and in your home?" We must see that it is not good enough just to have an objective Christ.</P><P>Of course, the objective side is the base. If we did not have any oranges in Southern California, we could not have an orange in us. There is no doubt that we need the objective side. But today there are millions of oranges in America, but how many oranges have we eaten? We need to make the objective produce of America something subjective within us. I am not satisfied just to be here in America surrounded by the objective produce. I want to put more and more American produce into my stomach. If you just preach Christ in the heavens, it is not good enough. The objective Christ in the heavens has nothing to do with you. You must have Him come into you. The more you know Christ in a subjective way, the more you will be satisfied with Him as the objective One.</P><P>Now let us read some verses from the Scripture to see the subjective Christ. John 1:14 says, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us." Verse 1 says that the Word was in the beginning, in eternity. Now the Word came in the flesh and is closer to us. He is not just in eternity but also in time; He is not just in divinity but also in humanity. He tabernacled among us. Notice the preposition used here is among. He tabernacled among us, but was not yet in us. When Christ was in the flesh, the most He could do was to be among us; He could not be in us.</P><P>John 14:16 says, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever." Here it is not clear whether He is among us or in us. It just says that He may be "with" us, which may mean that He is either among us or in us. Verse 17 says, "Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you." In you&#151;this is a strong word. Then verse 18 says, "I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you." This does not refer to His second coming. If it did, that would mean that the Lord has left us as orphans for nearly two thousand years. But the Lord did not do that. Verse 19 says, "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live." How long is "yet a little while"? Just three days. After He died, He came back right away in His resurrection. He went away at the most for seventy-two hours; then He came back as the Spirit. Yet a little while and the world beholds Him no longer, but the disciples behold Him; because He lives by His resurrection, they also shall live by being raised up with Him. Verse 20 says, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you." This is very subjective.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Centrality and Universality of Christ &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
