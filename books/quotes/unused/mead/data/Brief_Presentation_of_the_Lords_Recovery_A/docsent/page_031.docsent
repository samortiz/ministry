   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every Local Church Needing to Receive</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All Kinds of Genuine Believers in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every local church should receive all kinds of genuine believers in Christ Rom 14:1-6; 15:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have no right to give up any believer, unless he is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a believer becomes divisive, he is divided from the church already.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But as long as a believer is not divisive, we should not give him up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a believer prefers to keep the Sabbath whereas we take the Lord's Day, or if he eats only vegetables whereas we eat every kind of food, we still must receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must receive him because God has received him Rom 14:3 and because Christ has received him Rom 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must receive every believer in Christ according to Christ Rom 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not receive the believers according to their diet or according to our preference.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether we like a particular believer or not, we have no choice but to receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose you were born into a family of twelve brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You might like only yourself and one of your brothers and not like the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the fact that the other ten are in the same family is not up to you; it is up to your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They begot those peculiar ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, you have no choice but to receive them as your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, in the church a particular brother may have certain characteristics that are offensive to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we need to realize that our Father has begotten him and has received him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we give up this brother, we would give up our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we must receive all kinds of genuine believers, not according to anything of ourselves but according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must receive them because they have Christ; Christ is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a church does not receive all kinds of genuine believers, it is divisive and becomes a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A Believer to Be Kept Away</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>from the Fellowship of a Local Church</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of Only Three Things</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A believer can be kept away from the fellowship of a local church, that is, the fellowship of the Body of Christ, because of only three things.</S>
