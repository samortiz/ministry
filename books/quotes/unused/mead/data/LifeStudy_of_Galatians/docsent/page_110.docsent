   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING BY THE SPIRIT AS THE RULE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we consider Galatians 5:25 in light of the other verses where the Greek word stoicheo is used for walk, we shall see that to walk by the Spirit is to walk by the Spirit as our rule.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit Himself is the way, the rule, the line, the principle, leading toward God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit Himself should be our rule.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we would have the second walk by the Spirit, we must take the Spirit as our rule, our way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This may be illustrated by driving on a highway to reach a specific destination, which is different from merely driving around.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we drive on the highway, the lanes on the highway are a rule.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Driving according to this rule, we are able to reach our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our Christian walk, the second kind of walk by the Spirit is a walk in which the Spirit is the rule.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our rule should not be doctrine or theology.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, it should not be the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul s intention in writing to the Galatians was to tell them that they should no longer take the law as their rule.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Galatian believers had been distracted from the Spirit to the law and had taken it as their rule.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul told them that they were foolish and that they should return to the Spirit as their rule.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since they had life and lived by the Spirit, they should also walk by the Spirit as their rule.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would have the second walk for the fulfillment of God s purpose, we must first learn to walk by the Spirit as our way, rule, principle, and lane.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After World War II, my desire was to stay in north China.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, it was necessary for me to move first to the south and then to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although my intention was to go north, the Lord led me south.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, I was led by the Spirit to come to the United States and remain here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Walking by the Spirit in this way was for me a real experience of the second walk, the walk to reach God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To fulfill God s purpose and to reach His goal, we must take the Spirit as our highway.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because I have the assurance that I am taking the Spirit as my highway, I can be strong and bold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I encourage all the saints to have the second walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You need to pray, Lord, I will follow You to have the second walk by the Spirit for the fulfillment of Your purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not want to walk by doctrine, theology, organization, or natural concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I want to walk by the Spirit as my unique highway.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to 5:25, since we have received life and live by the Spirit, we should now have the second walk by the Spirit as our rule.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have been given life by the Spirit that we may walk by the Spirit to fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What a glorious goal lies before us!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The highway which leads us to this goal is the Spirit, the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we walk on this unique highway, we should neither swerve nor turn around, but move on directly to the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>WALKING BY THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 6:16 Paul says, And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The rule here is the new creation, mentioned in the preceding verse, where Paul says, For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the second walk by the Spirit we must walk by the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The new creation refers to man re-created with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first creation is for the new creation, for God s re-creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praise the Lord that when we were regenerated we were re-created!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In regeneration God is added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the time we were regenerated, we received the Triune God into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I can testify that having the Triune God in me is not merely a doctrine or religion; it is a glorious reality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah, the Triune God has been wrought into us!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a result, we are God s new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although God has made us a new creation, it is still possible for us to walk in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Galatians were walking in the old creation in their striving to keep the law by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul tried to bring them back to Christ and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He charged them to no longer walk in the old creation, but to walk in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To walk in the Spirit is to walk in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we would have the second walk, we must walk by the Spirit and by the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the ministry I am in fear and trembling lest I act in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If I should act according to the self or do anything by the flesh, I shall surely be in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even when I speak for the Lord, I am fearful that I might speak something out of the self or by the self.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>My desire is to speak always from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To speak from the Spirit is to be in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we are traveling on the highway of the Spirit, we should be careful not to do anything in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not drive our car by the old creation, but by the regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that we must drive the car by the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To be either religious or nonreligious is of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The only thing that avails is the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the Lord s recovery we do not want to do anything by the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our desire is to do everything by the Lord s mercy and grace in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that we would not do anything by the old man, but everything by the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Recently in some meetings we have been considering the problems caused by opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we are apart from the Lord, we are nothing but a constitution of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we are walking by the Spirit as the highway and yet still hold to our opinions, this is an indication that we are driving the car by the self.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Opinion is subtle, secret, and hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Often we are tempted to express our opinion about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if we insist on our opinion, we may cause a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we learn to drive the car by the new creation, we shall be fearful of expressing our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To say that the new creation is the rule by which we must walk does not mean that it is a different highway from the Spirit as our rule.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rather, it is to walk on the unique highway in a more particular, limited, and restricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Spirit is the highway in a general way, whereas the new creation is the lane in a more particular way.</S>
