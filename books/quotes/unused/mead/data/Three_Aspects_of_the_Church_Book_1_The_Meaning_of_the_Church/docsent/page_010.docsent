   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being to Himself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 1:5 says that God predestinated us to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The preposition to in the original Greek may also be rendered into, as in Romans 6:3, baptized into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 1 indicates that in His plan God first desires that the church have His life, become His sons, and become His heirs to inherit His possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, He desires that the church be made holy and be fully mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Third, He desires that the church be to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church becomes the sons of God by receiving God s life, obtaining God s sonship, becoming God s heirs, and inheriting God s possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church becomes holy by being sanctified and transformed, by having God mingled with the church and by the church being transformed from clay to gold.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the process of being made holy there is an inward progress advancing deeper layer by layer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Each layer is progressively deeper than the other.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The consummate step is to enter into God and be fully joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today we are still in the process of be joined to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The central thought of the Bible is that God and man are to be fully mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This mingling of God and man is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed into the same image as the Lord, from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that God mingles Himself with us in order that we may fully possess His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our clay will become gold, and then we will be to God, that is, fully brought into God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 6:3 says that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone who has been baptized has been brought to Christ, that is, into Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 1 shows that in God s original plan, He determined that the church would reach the point at which it would completely be to God, that is, brought into God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, it would be completely mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be holy is for God to be mingled with us; to be brought into God is for us to be mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the end of Revelation, when the holy city New Jerusalem appears, God will be in the church and the church will be in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God and His redeemed will no longer be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time God and His redeemed people will not merely be together; they will be one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They will have the same nature and the same glory; they will be completely one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has determined in His eternal plan that the church would obtain the sonship, be made holy, and be brought into Him so that the church will be completely one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not merely a doctrine; all of us have had some experience of this in the process of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we have not yet fully inherited God s possession, we do have a deep sense in our spirit that we are heirs of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have the life of God within us, and we have all had some experience of being made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times we have a deep feeling that we are in God, yet at other times it seems that we have come out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These experiences prove that being mingled into oneness with God is a real and practical matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since God desires that the church have the sonship, be holy, and be to Him, He chose and predestinated the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These two points require explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Choosing</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may think that God s choosing is an individual matter; however, the Bible shows that choosing is not an individual matter but a corporate one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Strictly speaking, God has not chosen any individual; rather, God has chosen the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some people may ask, Did God not choose Abraham as an individual?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we read the Bible carefully, we will realize that when God chose Abraham, He chose him and his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God chose the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the children of Israel left Egypt, it was not that one person left one day and another left the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From God s perspective, the children of Israel as a whole kept the Feast of the Passover, crossed the Red Sea, and were saved at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the same way, from God s point of view the church was chosen and redeemed corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is true that there is a difference in the dates of our individual salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God saves one person today and another tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Throughout the past two thousand years God has been saving people continuously and unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We were all saved one by one; however, with God there is no element of time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to God s perspective, He chose and redeemed us all at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Both Ephesians 1:4 and 1 Peter 1:2 speak of choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we read these two books, we will be clear that choosing is not an individual matter but a corporate matter related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God in His eternal plan chose the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Choosing means that a particular item is selected from among many items.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In His eternal plan God chose the church from among all the things that He had created.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church was chosen by God from among all things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God created not only the church but also all things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Among all the created things God chose a portion, that is, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This choosing did not occur after the creation of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God is not like us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can only see if something is good and choose accordingly after we finish making it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God s choosing began before the creation of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before the creation of the universe, in eternity, God chose the church according to His predestination and foreknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the meaning of God s choosing in the book of Ephesians.</S>
