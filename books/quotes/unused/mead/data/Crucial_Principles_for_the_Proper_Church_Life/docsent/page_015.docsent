   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22; 1 Cor 11:3a; 12:28; Matt 23:8, 10; 1 Pet 5:3, 5; Acts 2:14; 15:13, 19; Gal 2:9-14; Heb 13:17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This chapter concerns the headship of Christ and the constitution of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see what the constitution of the church is, that is, the way in which the church is formed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The constitution of the church is closely related to the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>BEING DENIED AND INSULTED</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>IN THE HIERARCHY IN CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, I would point out that in Christianity today the headship of Christ is altogether denied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This has occurred because Christianity has become an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The formation of any organization brings about a hierarchy, and every hierarchy has a head.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the hierarchy in Christianity insults the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Most are familiar with the organization of the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, there are the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Above the priests are the bishops, then the archbishops, the cardinals, and finally the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This hierarchy forms a pyramid with the pope on the top.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Catholic organization, with the pope as the head, is a great insult to the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This organization claims that the pope represents Christ, but this is actually a subtle way of putting Christ aside and denying the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Besides the Catholic Church, there are the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Church of England is the state church of England, with the Queen of England as its head.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the Anglican and Episcopalian churches derived from the Church of England, the Queen of England could be considered the head of these churches also.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Historically, the state churches of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway have had the head of state as their head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every state church is an organization with a head that replaces Christ and is thus an insult to the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Besides the state churches there are private churches, such as the Baptist Church, the Methodist Church, and the Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every private church also has an organization with a person, such as a chairman or a president, as its head.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The titles are different, and the complexity of the organizations differ, but the principle is always the same there is always an organization with a head, which insults the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Besides the Catholic Church, the state churches, and the private churches, there are the free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even every free group has an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Regardless of how loose their organization is, they still have an organization with a leader as the head.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, it is clear that Christianity is entirely a matter of organization, which leads to a hierarchy with a head, and this insults the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CHRIST FULFILLING GOD S ETERNAL PURPOSE AND BEING MADE HEAD OVER ALL THINGS God Needing a Man to Fulfill</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His Eternal Purpose in His Economy</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we must come to the Bible to see the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Most Christians do not realize that the headship of Christ was not completed in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ s headship was not completed in the Old Testament because at that time Christ had not yet become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the Son of God, He was only God, not a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to God s eternal purpose in His economy, God needs a man in order to accomplish two things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, a man is needed because God s eternal purpose is to work Himself into man and be mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, there is the definite need of humanity for the fulfilling of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today the church, which is the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose, is altogether human.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is simply humanity mingled with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second, a man was needed by God to destroy His enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because God would not lower Himself in His status as the Creator to deal with His creature Satan, He needed another creature, man, to defeat Satan.</S>
