   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN OUR CHURCH LIFE AND SERVICE Not Making Demands on Others</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>or Judging Them Superficially, but Knowing Them according to Their Deeper Condition</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We often expect that others will change according to our concept and standard.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, we should always go along with others; then there will be no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If two brothers live together, one may like to rise early, but the other may rise up later.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this case, the one who rises earlier should sacrifice his way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then one day the second brother may begin to rise even earlier than the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This illustrates that to contend about the right way is not necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the day of resurrection two disciples were going down to Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord Jesus joined them, He did not say, You are going the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This bothers Me, and I cannot go along with you unless you turn around.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since you are My disciples, you should go along with Me. In terms of right or wrong, those two disciples were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the Lord Jesus did not say anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, as they were going down, He went down also Luke 24:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then He acted as one who did not know anything, asking, What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking? v. 17 . One rebuked the Lord Jesus, saying, Do You alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days? v. 18 . To be sure, Jesus knew much better than they did.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we were the Lord Jesus, we might have said, Do you not know who I am?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am that person whom you are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, the Lord Jesus simply went along with them to a certain place, and when they arrived, they stopped to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible does not tell us how, but at that time their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the Lord disappeared, and the disciples rose up and returned to Jerusalem vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>28-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This account of the Lord Jesus in Luke 24 illustrates that we should not make demands on others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The brother who likes to rise early should simply go along with the one who sleeps longer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the first brother is not already a sloppy person, then sleeping longer for the sake of the other brother will not make him sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, his sleeping later will be for a proper reason.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then there will be no arguing between the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Shallow persons see things only according to their appearance and endlessly fight over them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not see things in a shallow, childish way and consider whether someone is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps we are wrong, and perhaps someone else s way is better than ours.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should be patient for a while and wait to see the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To criticize people is to judge them, but who are we to judge?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How do we know that we are right and others are wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To judge quickly is superficial, and to say absolutely yes or no is childish.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is right or wrong does not depend upon what is on the surface; it depends upon what is deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must learn to know people according to their deeper condition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do this, then by the Lord s grace there will be no problems among us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not Having a Definite Way in the Service</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>but Going On by Prayer and Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the church service we do not always need a definite decision about matters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In many matters we may not know what the right decision is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In almost all the Lord s work concerning the church affairs, we are like Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When he was called, he went out, not knowing where he was going Heb 11:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He did not have a definite decision.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, what he had was the Lord s presence step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we go on step by step without a definite decision but with a praying spirit and a spirit of depending one upon another, the Lord will lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the best way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not good always to have a definite way in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is better not to have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then we will pray more, seek the Lord, depend on the Lord, and fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not Insisting That Others Remain</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Where They Are Assigned in the Service</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If someone feels that it is better to serve in a different area than where he is first assigned, it is better to let him make the change.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After he makes this move, he will better appreciate where he should be.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No one should have too strong an assurance that his feeling is right.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps to move to another service group is right.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only the Lord knows, and even if we do know, we should still not insist that we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually, the brother will learn the proper lesson, and if he was wrong, he will come back.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is better to be spontaneous and not insist on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then we will not cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we insist that the brother remain where he was assigned in order to learn a lesson, it may be we who need to learn a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should never insist in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not Participating in Any Negative Talk</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should never participate in criticism, complaining, or arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To receive such negative talk is to be a trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If others criticize or speak in this way, we should excuse ourselves in a nice way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The more we allow ourselves to be involved with complaining, arguing, or vindicating, the more we are contaminated and receive the poison of death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should stay away from this kind of talk.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then the next time people come to us, they will come without this kind of criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They will simply come to fellowship and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the proper way to shepherd one another.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Not Making Proposals,</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>but Accepting Others Proposals</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>in Order for Everyone to Learn the Lessons</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our basic need is to learn how to be the priests built up in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The way we do this depends on our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must have a spirit of not dissenting and not showing that we are smarter than others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then we must also try not to propose other ways to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To propose other ways always sets up a bad example for others.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the church life, the best way is not to propose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If the steering wheel is under our hand, others should listen to us, but if it is in someone else s hand, we should not try to drive.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If someone genuinely asks us for a proposal and he truly needs it, and if to make a proposal does not set up an example of dissension, it may be the right time to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Whether or not to propose something depends on the situation and on our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, if someone else is taking the lead, we should listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In this case, even if our proposal is better than his, it is better not to say anything in order to keep the standard of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As long as we keep the oneness, we will save much time and be saved from many things, but if we lose the oneness, we will suffer loss in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We may gain something in one way, but we will lose in many other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In general, therefore, it is better not to propose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Then we will gain and not lose.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Still, if someone does propose something, we should go along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In this way everyone will learn.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we never do what someone proposes, he may not learn the lessons, and we ourselves may not learn anything either.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When the real nature of the proposal comes out, everyone will learn something.</S>
