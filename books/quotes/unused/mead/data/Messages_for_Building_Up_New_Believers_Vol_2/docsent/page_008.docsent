   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Greatest Obstacle to Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Sin</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer is a test; it exposes your spiritual condition before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If your spiritual condition is proper and normal, others will be saved one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As you intercede continuously before the Lord, you may find one or two persons saved after a few days or half a month.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After a while, another three or five may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>People should be saved regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If your prayers are not answered for a long time, it must mean that you are sick before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You should go to the Lord for light and find out where your problem lies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The greatest obstacle to prayer is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must learn to live a holy life before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must reject all known sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The moment we take sin lightly or tolerate it, our prayers will be hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sin has both an objective aspect and a subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The objective aspect has to do with God, while the subjective aspect has to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the objective side, sin obstructs God s grace and promises.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Isaiah 59:1-2 says, Behold, Jehovah s hand is not so short that it cannot save; / Nor is His ear so heavy that it cannot hear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>/ But your iniquities have become a separation / Between you and your God, / And your sins have hidden His face / From you so that He does not hear.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Psalm 66:18 says, If I regard iniquity in my heart, / The Lord will not hear.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a person does not take care of the problem of sin properly, he will find hindrance to his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unconfessed sins, sins which are never dealt with by the blood, are a big obstacle before God; they are the cause of unanswered prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is on the objective side.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the subjective side, sin damages man s conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a person sins, no matter what he says to himself, how much he reads the Bible, how many promises there are in the Word, how much grace God has, and how much He accepts him, his conscience will be weakened and bound.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Timothy 1:19 says, Holding faith and a good conscience, concerning which some, thrusting these away, have become shipwrecked regarding the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A ship may be old or small, but it cannot leak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Similarly, our conscience must not have a leak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As soon as the conscience is not at peace, many prayers cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, there are obstacles not only before God but even within man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The relationship between faith and conscience is just like that between a ship and its cargo.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Faith is like the cargo, and the conscience is like a ship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the ship has a leak, the cargo will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the conscience is strong, faith will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when there is a leak in the conscience, faith will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If our heart blames us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things 1 John 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you want to be a man of prayer, you must deal with sin thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You lived in sin for a long time in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are not careful with it now, you will not be totally free from it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have to deal with sin seriously; you have to come before God to confess every sin, putting every sin under the blood, refusing it, and coming out from it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then your conscience will be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As soon as the blood cleanses, the conscience is recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There will be no condemnation, and spontaneously you will see God s face.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Never give in to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This will weaken you before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you are weak before the Lord, you will not be able to intercede for others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as sin remains, you will not be able to utter anything in your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sin is the number one problem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You should pay attention to it all the time, even daily.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If one deals with sin properly before the Lord, he will be able to offer proper prayers, and others will be brought to the Lord through him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>D. Praying with Faith</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Another important thing is to have faith in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the conscience is blameless, it is easy for faith to be strong, and if faith is strong, spontaneously our prayers will be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Faith is freedom from doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is to accept God s promises in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is God who asks us to pray and who wants us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God said, Concerning the work of My hands, command Me Isa 45:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we pray, God has to answer us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Jesus said, Knock and it shall be opened to you Matt 7:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is impossible for Him not to open after we have knocked.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Jesus said, Seek and you shall find.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is impossible for us not to find after we have sought.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Jesus said, Ask and it shall be given to you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is impossible for us to ask and yet not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do not believe this, what kind of God do we think our God is?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must see that God s promises are faithful and dependable.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Faith is based on our knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The more we know God, the stronger our faith will be.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are saved already; we know God already.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, we can believe; there should not be any difficulty at all for us to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we believe, God will answer our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Learn to be a person full of faith from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should not trust in our feelings or our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Instead, we should believe in God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God s promises are like cash; they work.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In fact, God s promises are God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The promises tell us of God s work, while His work is the manifestation of His promises.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have to accept God s promises in the same way we accept His work.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When we believe God s word, abiding in faith rather than in doubt, we will see how real God s words are and we will find answers to our prayers.</S>
