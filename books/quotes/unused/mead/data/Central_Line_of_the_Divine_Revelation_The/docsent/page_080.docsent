   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After the first promise in Genesis 3:15, twenty-seven centuries passed until the time of Isaiah, who repeated God's promise: "Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel" Isa 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This son borne by the virgin is the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For two thousand years after the first promise was given, nothing took place to fulfill that promise.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man continued to fall step by step, all the way to the bottom, to Babel Gen 11:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, God called Abraham out of the fallen race and promised him that he would be a blessing to all the nations on the earth 12:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, God gave more details, saying that not through Abraham directly but through his seed all the nations of the earth would be blessed 22:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This became the promise to Abraham concerning the seed of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then, approximately one thousand years later God promised David that He would establish the throne of his seed forever 2 Sam 7:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was the promise to David concerning the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These three promises, concerning the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David, were fulfilled four thousand years after man was created Matt 1:1, 18-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord was very patient.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First He promised; then four thousand years later He fulfilled the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the middle of the four thousand years He repeated the promise to Abraham, and after another thousand years He repeated the promise to David.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One thousand years after that, Jesus came to fulfill the three promises.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ as the threefold seed in humanity is a great subject in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Triune God, the complete God, created man and then purposed to be born of fallen man to become a threefold seed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first aspect of this seed was to destroy Satan to deliver fallen man out of sin, death, and self.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second aspect was to be a blessing to the fallen race.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He Himself would be the blessing in His Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By this we can see that the Trinity is not a doctrinal matter but a matter of dispensing and enjoyment to the fallen race.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The seed of Abraham is the consummated God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the truth the Lord has shown us in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before the incarnation, God was complete, yet He was not consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, His intention was to become a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to realize that today our God is absolutely different from the God of the Jews and from the God of the Moslems.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The God of both the Jews and the Moslems is only a divine person, not a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But our God today is God plus man, the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our God is a God who is one with man to the extent that He became a man, a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now, in His constitution He has both divinity and humanity as His elements.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nearly every page of the sixty-six books of the Bible is occupied with the threefold seed in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This threefold seed in humanity is God who became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, He became the seed of the woman to overcome all the enemies Satan, sin, death, and man's self.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, He became the seed of Abraham to be the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This consummation began with incarnation and ended in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In resurrection this incarnated One became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a great truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Nicene Creed does not mention this, nor does it mention the sevenfold Spirit in Revelation 1:4, 4:5, and 5:6.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Triune God has not only been consummated as the life-giving Spirit; He has been intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the clear revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul, in 1 Corinthians 15:45, saw only the life-giving Spirit, but John saw not only the consummated Triune God but also the consummated Triune God intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The conclusion of my study of the Bible is that the Triune God, the complete, eternal God, one day became a threefold seed in humanity, first, to destroy God's enemies, second, to cause Himself to be consummated for the blessing of His chosen people, and third, to be the seed of David to bring in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He came not just to be a blessing to His chosen people but to set His chosen people up as a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This kingdom is the great mountain in Daniel 2:34-35 that will fill the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The great mountain is the corporate threefold seed in humanity, which includes all the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are all incorporated in that great mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The threefold seed in humanity first dealt with all the enemies; second, He became the consummated Triune God as our full blessing, intensified sevenfold; and third, He made His chosen people His kingdom that fills not only the earth but also the heavens, causing the whole universe to become His great kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The enemies are gone, the blessing is here, and we are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the revelation of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How wonderful this is!</S>
