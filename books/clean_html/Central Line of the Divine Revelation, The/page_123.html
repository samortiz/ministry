<P>In the wilderness the children of Israel also had a problem concerning water. God gave them water out of the cleft rock (17:1-6). According to Paul in 1 Corinthians 10:4, the rock followed them through the wilderness. The rock was struck by the lawgiver, Moses, and out of the cleft rock living water flowed to quench their thirst.</P><P>In addition to the foregoing items, God's full salvation included the matter of healing. At Marah God as their Physician healed them by changing the bitter water into sweet water (Exo. 15:23-25).</P><P>Of the above ten aspects of God's full salvation, the first aspect that indicates something of God's dispensing Himself into His redeemed is the flesh of the Passover lamb. On the night of the Passover, the lamb had to be slain. According to history, the Israelites placed the lamb on two pieces of wood put together in the form of a cross, with one vertical stake and one horizontal crossbar. They tied the forefeet of the lamb on the horizontal crossbar and the hind legs to the vertical stake. They then slew the lamb, shedding its blood, and took the blood and applied it on the lintel and the two doorposts of their houses for their redemption. By applying the blood in this way, they were saved. They knew that the angel would smite the firstborn in all of the land of Egypt, but because they were under the covering of the blood, their firstborn would not be killed. Then, in their homes they roasted the lamb that they might eat it.</P><P>God's full salvation involved something on God's side and something on the children of Israel's side. God's side involved the above-mentioned ten items. On their side, the children of Israel ate the lamb with their staffs in their hands, with their shoes on their feet, and with their loins girded (Exo. 12:11). This was their preparation to leave Egypt. After the people ate the flesh of the lamb, the lamb was dispensed into them, and by this dispensing they were strengthened.</P><P>In God's full salvation as typified by the experience of the children of Israel, in addition to the flesh of the lamb, the unleavened bread, the manna, and the water also indicate something of God's dispensing of Himself into His redeemed people. It is the same with us today. In God's full salvation today, we enjoy God's dispensing by Christ being our Lamb, our unleavened bread, our manna, and our spiritual water.</P>
