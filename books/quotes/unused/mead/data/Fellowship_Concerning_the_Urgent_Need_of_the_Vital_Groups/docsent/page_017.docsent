   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONDITION LOVING ONE ANOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ONENESS AND WITH ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The condition of the vital groups is that of loving one another in oneness and with one accord John 13:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To love one another may seem very common.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, we must admit that although we do love one another, we may not love one another very much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because we meet together day after day and year after year, we surely have human affection for one another; but the condition of loving one another in the vital groups should be more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to love one another, meeting together in a mutual love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We not only love one another, but we love one another in oneness and with one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 17 the Lord Jesus said that when His disciples are one in the Triune God, the whole world will believe that He was sent by the Father vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the way to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Often when we go out to visit people by twos and threes, the people whom we visit may realize that there is no oneness among us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The result is a lack of impact.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if two or three of us go out as one man, the people whom we visit will realize that there is a dynamic power among us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There will be the impact, and they will be convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John 13:34-35 the Lord Jesus said, A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By our loving one another the whole world will know that we are the Lord s disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the real impact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without our speaking anything, people will be convinced because they see us loving one another in oneness and with one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the whole earth, in every society everyone knows that whenever people group together, there is struggling and fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Wherever there are groups of people, there will be debates, arguments, and strife.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when people are among us and we are really one, they will wonder what has made us one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus is the living person who has made us one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our being one is the strongest testimony that we are the people of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are disciples of the One who has made us one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are the terms and conditions for us to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regardless of how much others oppose us, if we are such people, nothing can prevent us from gaining the proper increase.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>PRACTICAL FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>REGARDING THE VITAL GROUPS The Need for Leadership</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In forming the groups, each group should not have more than seven to eight members.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Also, although I do not like the matter of leadership, after many years I have discovered by experience and with the confirmation of the Bible that without leadership no one can be properly grouped together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Leadership is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because of the need for leadership, the Lord Jesus appointed the twelve apostles Matt 10:1-4; Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the Lord s ascension, the twelve apostles remained on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The only way they could remain on this earth to be the Lord s testimony was by being grouped together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The apostle Paul was a very spiritual person and was organic in all things, yet in his practice he still appointed elders in every city for every church Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then in 1 Timothy 3 he taught concerning the raising up of the elders and the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, according to our learning, there is a need for leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not have a king, but we do need to have two leaders for each group.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Having two leaders will be a help by matching the two together.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Need for a Practical Arrangement</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We also need the proper practical arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In principle on this earth, wherever anything is properly arranged, there will be a proper result.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have the highest truths.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we cannot be successful in our practice, what a shame that would be.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of course, we should pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must depend on God, on the Lord, on the Holy Spirit, and on the divine life, yet we should not forget the New Testament principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The New Testament principle of incarnation is that everything for God s interest should be done by God through man and should be done by man with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our grouping ourselves together is to take care of our human responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are all for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we must find a way to meet the Lord s need.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not, we will owe the Lord something.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our practicing the vital groups does not mean that we are changing our way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We still trust in the Lord, and we still believe in the Spirit, in the Word, and in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We trust in these three things to build up the church, but there is the need of the human side.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When God created man, He formed man with a body of clay Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That body was an organization, because at that point there was no life in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then God breathed into this body the breath of life, making the body organic.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then man became a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This organism has a physical and visible aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today the church as an entity has the Triune God within as the organic element, and it also has a proper outward arrangement as its physical and visible aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although I taught very much concerning the group meetings, during the past three years I have not seen much result in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After further study I found out that we are short of the physical side, the side of having a proper practical arrangement.</S>
