[2]  The first seven chapters of this book consist of messages given during a conference in Tokyo, Japan, in October of 1984.
[3]  In this book we will see the secret of experiencing Christ.
[4]  Christ is the focus, the center, of the entire Bible.
[5]  In John 6:46 and 16:27 the Lord Jesus said that He was "from God," and in John 17:8 He prayed to the Father, "I came forth from You, and...You sent Me."
[6]  The Bible tells us that the Father was always with the Son.
[7]  While Christ was on this earth, He told people that the Father was always with Him and never left Him alone John 8:16, 29; 16:32 .
[8]  After reading these two verses, you might ask, "Who sent the Spirit, the Son or the Father?"
[9]  One verse, 15:26, says that the Son sent the Spirit, and the other, 14:26, that the Father sent the Spirit in the Son's name.
[10]  The Bible reveals that Christ went to the cross, died, was buried, and rose from the dead.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST THE PERFECT MAN Scripture Reading: Matt 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35; John 1:14; 1 Tim 3:16; Rom 8:3; John 3:14; Num 21:8-9; 2 Cor 5:21; 1 Cor 15:45b, 47b; Isa 53:2-3; Col 1:15; John 1:29; Gen 3:15; Heb 2:14; John 12:31; Gen 12:3; Gal 3:14, 16; 2 Sam 7:12-13; Matt 1:1; 16:18-19; 1:21; Luke 2:11; Matt 16:16a; Col 1:20; Heb 2:9; Eph 2:14-15; John 12:24 THE COMPLETE GOD
[12]  For us to experience Christ, we must receive a revelation concerning His Person.
[13]  Because Christ was constituted of God and man in His conception, He was born a God-man.
[14]  Because Christ was conceived of God and man, He was born a God-man.
[15]  But Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians 5:21 that Christ was made sin for us by God.
[16]  Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation.
[17]  Since Christ became a man and a man is a creature, Christ surely became a creature.
[18]  As a man, this Christ is Jesus, which means "Jehovah the Savior" Matt 1:21; Luke 2:11 .
[19]  CHAPTER THREE THE WORK OF CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 4:17; 16:18-19; Mark 1:1, 14; 4:3, 26; Luke 4:18-22a; 19:2-10; 10:30-37; John 1:18; 14:9; 5:30b; 6:38; 1:29; 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 8:3; Heb 2:14; John 3:14; Num 21:8-9; Rom 6:6; 1 Cor 15:45a; Col 1:15, 20; Heb 2:9; Eph 2:14-15; John 12:24
[20]  In the previous two chapters we have covered a number of points concerning the Person of Christ.
[21]  Beginning with this chapter we will go on to see a number of points concerning His work.
[22]  The work of Christ is composed of four major items: His ministry on earth, His crucifixion, His resurrection, and His ascension.
[23]  John's Gospel reveals that Christ lived God and did the Father's will.
[24]  The second accomplishment of Christ's crucifixion is that sin in the flesh was condemned by God through Christ who was made sin on the cross for the believers 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 8:3 .
[25]  First, Christ took away sin, and, second, Christ was made sin.
[26]  The fifth accomplishment of Christ's crucifixion was that He dealt with the old creation by being terminated as the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 , and He redeemed all the creation by tasting death for everything Col 1:20; Heb2:9 .
[27]  Christ is the first item of the creatures, the Firstborn of all creation.
[28]  CHAPTER FOUR THE WORK OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Acts 3:15; 5:30-31; Rom 4:25; Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29; John 12:24; 1 Pet 1:3; John 12:28; 13:31-32; 17:1; Luke 24:26; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 20:22; Acts 2:36; Eph 1:22, 10; Acts 2:33; 1 Cor 12:13; Heb 7:22; 8:6; 9:15-17; 4:15; 7:26; Rev 1:13; 2:1; 1:5; 5:5-6
[29]  In the three foregoing chapters we pointed out that in order to experience Christ, we first need to receive revelation concerning the Person and work of Christ.
[30]  In the last chapter we covered what Christ accomplished in His life on earth and in His death.
[31]  Christ's resurrection was a strong vindication of His great success in all His achievements Acts 5:30-31 .
[32]  The New Testament reveals that in Christ's resurrection, He was born as the firstborn Son of God.
[33]  Acts 13:33 says, "God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second psalm, You are My Son; today I have begotten You."
[34]  Today Christ is the Son of God in two respects: He is God's only begotten Son and He is also God's firstborn Son.
[35]  However, if He were only God's only begotten Son, He could not have any brothers.
[36]  To have us as His brothers, He must possess humanity; but as God's only begotten Son in eternity past, He possessed only divinity, not humanity.
[37]  Nevertheless, in His incarnation Christ put on humanity, and through resurrection He brought this humanity into sonship.
[38]  Furthermore, Christ's resurrection was His glorification that God might be glorified in Him John 12:28; 13:31-32; 17:1; Luke 24:26 .
[39]  Christ's ascension made Him the Christ of God Acts 2:36b .
[40]  Actually, He was the Christ already before His ascension Matt 16:16 .
[41]  He was even called Christ from His birth Matt 1:16 .
[42]  In His death Christ made the better covenant for us with God.
[43]  In ascension He became the Mediator, the Surety, of the better covenant made by Him through His death Heb 8:6; 9:15-17; 7:22 .
[44]  It is wonderful not only in revealing Christ's Person and work, but it is even more wonderful in its revelation of this organic union.
[45]  As the life-giving Spirit, Christ has regenerated the believers in their spirit John 3:5-6 .
[46]  Doctrinally, it is difficult to explain how Christ, after entering into us, regenerates us in our spirit.
[47]  When a sinner repents, confesses his sins, believes in the Lord Jesus, and calls on His name, at that very moment Christ as the life-giving Spirit enters into his spirit to enliven his dead spirit, that is, to regenerate him in his spirit.
[48]  First, as the life-giving Spirit, Christ regenerated us in our spirit.
[49]  CHAPTER SIX ABIDING IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 15:4-5, 7-8; 1 John 2:27-28, 21-23; Col 2:4, 8; 1 Tim 1:3-4; Eph 4:14; 1 John 2:16; James 4:1, 3; Phil 4:6; 2:14; Eph 4:26, 31; Gal 5:2-4; Col 2:20-21; 1 John 1:2-3; 4:8, 16; 1:5-7; 2:6; 3:24; 4:15-16; John 14:23; Rom 6:5; Eph 4:15; Col 2:7; 1 Cor 3:6; John 15:8
[50]  In the previous chapter we saw our organic union with Christ.
[51]  In this organic union we are actually one with Christ in the Spirit.
[52]  Based upon this union, the New Testament tells us that we need to abide in Christ.
[53]  Another category of distractions from Christ is philosophy Col 2:4, 8 .
[54]  To abide in Christ is not only to remain in Him, but also to dwell in Him.
[55]  To dwell in Him means to make your home in Him.
[56]  In the previous chapters we have seen Christ's Person, Christ's work, and our organic union with Him.
[57]  For us to experience Christ, we need to see who He is and what He has done for us.
[58]  We have skin, flesh, and bones; we have many physical parts which are touchable and visible.
[59]  In our hymnal we selected about 800 hymns from over 10,000 collected hymns.
[60]  Among these selected hymns were a number of hymns written by A.B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance.
[61]  Christ lives in resurrection, and He lives within us.
[62]  In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, "It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."
[63]  If you are a person who lives Christ, then everyone will find you in Christ.
[64]  People will realize that you are a person in Christ, not in anything else.
[65]  You live Christ, and you express Christ in your daily life; thus, what people see in you is Christ expressed by you.
[66]  If we experience such a daily salvation, we will shine as luminaries, as lights, in the world, holding forth the word of life Phil 2:15-16 .
[67]  On the one hand, we are preaching and teaching the word of life; on the other hand, we are presenting the living word of life by our living Christ.
[68]  IN GALATIANS Scripture Reading: Gal 1:4, 13-14; 2:19, 21; 4:21; 5:2-4, 17, 24; 6:13-15; 2:20; 3:2, 5, 14, 23; 4:6; 5:5-6, 16, 18, 25; 6:8, 18
[69]  As the book of Galatians indicates, Christ has been revealed in us 1:15-16 .
[70]  He is living in us 2:20 , and He is being formed in us 4:19 .
[71]  Furthermore, we have put on Christ as our clothing 3:27 .
[72]  Now we must go on to consider what this faith is.
[73]  The faith that has been infused into us is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the word.
[74]  When the word spoken to us enters into us, it becomes the Spirit, and this Spirit is the faith.
[75]  In 5:16 and 25 Paul charges us to walk by the Spirit.
[76]  If we regularly contact the Word, we shall be infused with the Spirit.
[77]  This infusion of the Spirit will become the faith which is the realization of Christ.
[78]  AND THE CHURCH IN EPHESIANS Scripture Reading: Eph 1:18; 2:14-15; 4:14, 17; 6:11-12; 1:13, 17; 2:8; 3:15-19; 4:23, 30; 5:18-20, 26; 6:17-18
[79]  Before we were saved, we were subject to certain negative things.
[80]  A second negative thing we confront after being saved is ordinances 2:15 .
[81]  The fourth negative thing in Ephesians is the vanity of the mind.
[82]  In 4:17 Paul says, "This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the nations also walk in the vanity of their mind."
[83]  Being renewed in the spirit of our mind also has much to do with the Word.
[84]  IN PHILIPPIANS Scripture Reading: Phil 1:17, 20; 2:3a, 4, 14, 21; 3:2, 4-8; 4:6a, 11; 1:19-21a; 2:12b-13, 16a; 3:3, 8b-9a; 4:4, 6b, 13, 23
[85]  Although we have the assurance that we are eternally saved, we still need to be saved day by day and even moment by moment.
[86]  Compared with those in Galatians and Ephesians, the negative things in Philippians are small matters.
[87]  Instead of such things as the religious world, ordinances, the vanity of the mind, and Satan, we have murmurings, reasonings, rivalry, vainglory, and anxiety.
[88]  In 2:21 Paul says that "all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus."
[89]  The last of the negative things in Philippians is what Paul describes as want 4:11 .
[90]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE SECRET OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST, THE HEAD, FOR THE CHURCH, THE BODY Scripture Reading: Col 2:4, 8, 16-18, 20-23; 3:2b; 1:8, 24; 2:5-7; 3:2a, 16, 17; 4:2 NEGATIVE THINGS
[91]  In Colossians 2:8 Paul mentions some of the negative things dealt with in this book: "Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ."
[92]  When we take in the Word in a proper way, we have both faith and the Spirit.
[93]  In a very real sense, the Word, the Spirit, and faith are one.
[94]  When we read the Bible in a proper way, especially when we pray-read it, we receive inspiration.
[95]  This inspiration is the moving of the living Spirit within us.
[96]  This moving of the Spirit is the function of the Spirit, and in the New Testament this function is called faith.
[97]  But if we put these books together, we see five things that are crucial for our experience of Christ: the Word, faith, the Spirit, our spirit, and prayer.
[98]  If God had not created us with a spirit, we would not be able to receive inspiration from the Word, no matter how many times we may read it or repeat parts of it.
[99]  In Colossians 2:5 Paul says, "For though indeed I am absent in the flesh, yet in the spirit I am with you, rejoicing and seeing your order and the firmness of your faith in Christ."
[100]  In our daily life we also need to care for the younger ones, sharing with them our experience of Christ and enjoyment of Him.
