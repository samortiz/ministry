   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE ELDERS' EVALUATION OF PEOPLE Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:4; Luke 14:21, 23; 1 Cor 1:26-29; 12:22-25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to fellowship about the elders' evaluation of people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most of us have been wrong in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All human beings like to evaluate others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we see a new person, we like to weigh him, to put him on the scale, the balance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We desire to find out how much he is worth and how weighty or grave he would or could be.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all have such a habit by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This habit has gotten into us already.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even young children have the habit of evaluating others in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to come back to the Bible to see how the Lord Jesus evaluates people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CONCERNING THE SINNERS God Desiring All People to Be Saved</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Timothy 2:4 says that God desires all people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to God's evaluation, He considers everyone the same in His desire for them to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Wanting to Get the Poor</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and Crippled and Blind and Lame, and Even</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Commanding Us to Compel Them to Come In</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have heard some say that the ones we visit are not worthwhile for us to work on because they are from the lower class.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to see what the Lord's way is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord wants to get the poor and crippled and blind and lame, and He even commands us to compel them to come in Luke 14:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Would we be encouraged by gaining a "crippled" one?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to our natural being, we look down on people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, many of us have set ourselves up as a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I told one brother that whenever he goes to any place, he has a "yardstick" in his pocket to measure the people and the things there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He does not measure what is good, but he always likes to measure the worst things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is wrong for the Lord's servants to have such a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever we meet others, we should not measure them in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Lord Jesus' earthly ministry, people complained a number of times about the kinds of people He contacted Luke 15:2; 7:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Lord contacted Zaccheus, He told him, "Today I must stay in your house" 19:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When others saw this, "they all grumbled, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a sinful man" v. 7 . If you met such a person as Zaccheus today, would you go to visit him and stay with him? Our natural being needs to be transformed to a spiritual being so that we can have the view, the sight, that the Triune God has.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God desires all men to be saved, but actually not one descendant of Adam is worthy of His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may think that certain people are worthy of the Lord's salvation, but no one is worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Daniel 9 records a long confession which Daniel made to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After Daniel came to know from the book of Jeremiah that the children of Israel would endure seventy years of captivity v. 2 , he made this long confession.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His asking for forgiveness was not based upon anything they had done, but upon the Lord's great compassion, His great mercy v. 18 . God's great compassion was the basis for his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Daniel's evaluation of himself and of all his people, including all the rulers and chief men, was that they were in desperate need of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may pray this way at times, but deep within us, we always give ourselves a high evaluation and give others a low evaluation.</S>
