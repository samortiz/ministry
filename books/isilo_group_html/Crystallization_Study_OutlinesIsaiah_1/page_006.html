<h1 class="title">The Great Light</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 9:1-5; 42:6; 49:6; 50:10-11; 2:5</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The light in Genesis 1:3 is a type of Christ as the real light&mdash;John 1:4-5, 9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is the true light of the universe; He is the rising sun from on high, the bright morning star, and the Sun of righteousness&mdash;Luke 1:78; Rev. 22:16b; Mal. 4:2.</li>
	<li>The physical light in Genesis 1:3 is a type of Christ as the spiritual light for the new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 4:6; 5:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Light is necessary for generating life; according to a great principle in the Bible, light is for life, and where light is, there is life&mdash;John 8:12; 1:9, 12.</li>
		<li>In Genesis light is for the old creation, but in the Gospel of John light is for the new creation; the old creation was brought into existence through physical light, whereas the new creation is brought into being through Christ as spiritual light&mdash;vv. 4-5, 9, 12; 8:12; 12:36; 2 Cor. 4:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The divine light is the nature of God&rsquo;s expression, it shines in the divine life, and it is the source of the divine truth&mdash;1 John 1:5-6; John 1:4; 8:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Light is God&rsquo;s shining, God&rsquo;s expression; when God is expressed, the nature of that expression is light&mdash;1 John 1:5.</li>
	<li>The divine light shines in the divine life, for light and life go together&mdash;John 1:4; 8:12; Psa. 36:9.</li>
	<li>The divine light is the source of the divine truth; when the divine light shines upon us, it becomes the truth, which is the divine reality&mdash;John 1:5, 9; 8:12, 32; 18:37.</li>
	<li>The divine light, which shines in the divine life and issues in the divine truth, is embodied in the Lord Jesus, God incarnate&mdash;1:1, 4, 14; 8:12; 9:5; 14:6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ is the great light for shining in darkness and for release from bondage&mdash;Isa. 9:1-5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the great light, Christ is the true light, the light of life&mdash;John 1:9, 4; 8:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is the unique light; apart from Him there is no light&mdash;12:46.</li>
		<li>In order to have true light, we must have Christ in an experiential way&mdash;Micah 7:8; John 8:12.</li>
		<li>We can see light only in the light of Christ; if we want light, we must receive Christ and touch Christ&mdash;Psa. 36:9b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the great light, Christ shines upon the people walking in darkness and upon those dwelling in the land of the shadow of death&mdash;Isa. 9:2; John 1:5; Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is the light to be the salvation of God&mdash;Isa. 49:6.</li>
		<li>Christ saves us by shining on us; His shining upon us as the great light is our salvation&mdash;Acts 9:3; 22:6; 26:13.</li>
		<li>The inner shining of Christ is His saving us from the darkness of death&mdash;Isa. 9:2; Matt. 1:21, 23; 4:16; 2 Cor. 4:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s shining as the great light upon God&rsquo;s people releases them from bondage in darkness, breaks the yoke that has been upon them, and destroys their enemies and destroys their armor&mdash;Isa. 9:3-5; 10:26-27.</li>
	<li>The prophecy in Isaiah 9:2 was fulfilled in Matthew 4:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When Christ came to Galilee, the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, light sprang up.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s ministry did not begin with earthly power but with heavenly light:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This light is Christ Himself as the light of life, shining in the shadow of death&mdash;John 12:46; 8:12.</li>
			<li>Christ is the great light with the power to attract people and capture them&mdash;Matt. 4:17-22.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In particular, the Lord&rsquo;s teaching was the shining of a great light; every word that issued from His mouth was an enlightening word, and the people in darkness were enlightened by His teaching&mdash;Mark 1:21-22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We can see the Christian life in Isaiah 9:1-5 with the enjoyment of Christ as the great light; through His shining, He saves us and breaks the yoke of our burden, the staff on our shoulder, and the rod of our oppressor.</li>
	<li>Christ was called by Jehovah to be a light for the nations&mdash;42:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is the true light that shines over the world and enlightens every man to enliven man for regeneration; He is the light for God&rsquo;s people to receive God as life&mdash;John 1:4, 9, 12-13; 1 John 1:5; 5:11-12.</li>
		<li>Christ is the divine, marvelous light to open the eyes of the blind and to deliver God&rsquo;s chosen people out of the darkness of death, the death-realm, the authority of Satan, into God&rsquo;s life-realm of light&mdash;Isa. 42:7; Acts 26:18; Col. 1:12-13.</li>
		<li>Although Isaiah 49:6 refers to Christ, whom God made a light to the Gentiles so that His salvation might reach to the ends of the earth, the apostle Paul, who was one with Christ in carrying out God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ, applied this prophetic word to himself in his ministry of gospel preaching&mdash;Acts 13:47.</li>
		<li>God has called us out of darkness&mdash;the expression and sphere of Satan in death&mdash;into His marvelous light&mdash;the expression and sphere of God in life&mdash;1 Pet. 2:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We were once darkness, but we are now light in the Lord, and we should walk as children of light&mdash;Eph. 5:8-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As God is light, so we, the children of God, are children of light&mdash;1 John 1:5; Eph. 5:8; John 12:36.</li>
	<li>We are not only children of light; we are light itself because we are one with God in the Lord&mdash;Eph. 5:8; Matt. 5:14; 1 John 1:5.</li>
	<li>The fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the Triune God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God the Father as goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light; therefore, <em>goodness</em> in Ephesians 5:9 refers to God the Father&mdash;Matt. 19:17.</li>
		<li><em>Righteousness</em> refers to God the Son, for Christ came to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose according to God&rsquo;s righteous procedure&mdash;Rom. 5:17-18, 21.</li>
		<li><em>Truth,</em> the expression of the fruit in the light, refers to God the Spirit, for He is the Spirit of reality&mdash;John 14:17; 16:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>He who fears Jehovah and hears the voice of His Servant should trust in Jehovah so that he may have light while walking in darkness&mdash;Isa. 50:10-11; Psa. 139:7-12, 23-24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Those who make light for themselves and walk in their self-made light instead of God&rsquo;s light will suffer torment&mdash;Isa. 50:11.</li>
	<li>This should be a warning to us so that we may walk in the light given by God, not in the light we make for ourselves&mdash;1 John 1:5.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah&rdquo;&mdash;Isa. 2:5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As the shining light, the believers in Christ, the kingdom people, are like a city situated upon a mountain, a city that cannot be hidden&mdash;Matt. 5:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This light is not an individual believer; it is a corporate city built up as one entity to shine over the people surrounding it&mdash;16:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The city is the light; if there is no city, there is no light&mdash;Rev. 21:23-24.</li>
		<li>If we are divided, we are finished with the shining; in order to be a shining city, we must keep the oneness and remain one entity, a corporate Body&mdash;Eph. 4:1-6; 5:8-9.</li>
		<li>If we would become this city of light, we need to be built up as the Body of Christ&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To be built up with fellow believers is the Lord&rsquo;s supreme and highest requirement of His faithful seekers according to the divine oneness of the Divine Trinity&mdash;John 17.</li>
			<li>Being built up with fellow partakers of the divine life is the highest virtue of one who pursues after Christ according to God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Eph. 2:21-22; Phil. 3:7-12.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Ultimately, this city of light will consummate in the holy city, the New Jerusalem, and &ldquo;the nations will walk by its light&rdquo;&mdash;Rev. 21:10-11, 23-24.</li>
