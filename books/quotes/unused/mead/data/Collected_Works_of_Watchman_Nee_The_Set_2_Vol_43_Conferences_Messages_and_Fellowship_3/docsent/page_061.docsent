   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTY-FOUR FIVE KINDS OF FORGIVENESS Date: April 6, 1938</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Penang</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:9; James 5:15; Eph 4:32; Luke 24:47; John 20:22-23; Matt 18:21-35; 6:14-15</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the passages we have read today speak of forgiveness, but the forgiveness that is spoken of in each place is different.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 4:32 speaks of a forgiveness that comes from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 20:22-23 speaks of a forgiveness that is related to the authority of the church; the church has authority to forgive men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This forgiveness is different from the forgiveness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First John 1:9 shows us that when a man confesses his sin before the Lord, he is forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>James 5:15, however, speaks of a special kind of forgiveness in which a sick brother should ask the elders to anoint him with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His sickness will then be healed, and his sins will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Finally, Matthew 6:14-15 says that if we forgive others' offenses, our Father will also forgive our offenses, and if we do not forgive others' offenses, our Father will also not forgive our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Bible, there is more than one kind of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In fact, there are at least five kinds of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These five kinds of forgiveness are: 1 eternal forgiveness this relates to the matter of life; 2 instrumental forgiveness this relates to the church; 3 restorative forgiveness this relates to fellowship; 4 governmental forgiveness this relates to discipline; and 5 kingdom forgiveness this relates to administration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have made up these five expressions for ease of reference.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ETERNAL FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eternal forgiveness refers to God forgiving our sins through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once we are forgiven, we are forgiven forever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We receive eternal life forever, and we are justified forever.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of our sins before God are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to receive this forgiveness, we have to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once we believe in Him, we are immediately forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This does not come about through man's work but through the work of the Lord's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord's blood, which was shed on the cross, has dealt with all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Exodus 12 tells us that the Israelites slaughtered the lamb at the Passover and put the blood of the lamb on the doorpost and side posts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God saw the blood, He passed over the house immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The blood of Christ guarantees that we will not perish, because His blood has satisfied God's righteous requirement according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The blood speaks of the price of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once sin encounters the blood, we find forgiveness, and our sins before God are washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When a man's sins are judged, his sins before God are thoroughly removed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>INSTRUMENTAL FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the night of the Lord's resurrection, He breathed into the disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the Lord resurrected, He gave the Holy Spirit to the disciples and told them that they had the authority to forgive or to retain others' sins John 20:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only after a man has received the Holy Spirit will he have the authority to forgive or retain others' sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why did the Lord say that the disciples and the church have authority to forgive men's sins?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This forgiveness is an indirect forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God forgives men directly, and He also forgives men indirectly through other men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our forgiveness before God is based on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But here is an institution on earth the church, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A person's sins may be forgiven, but he must still go through the judgment of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If his sins are considered as forgiven, he can be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if they are not considered as forgiven, then he cannot be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the church comes together to break bread and someone walks in, he may be a saved person, but the worker or the church must judge whether he is partaking of the flesh and blood in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If such a one is not a Christian according to our opinion, we should not receive him, because he is not one of us and has nothing to do with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a church is short of the power and leading of the Holy Spirit, it surely will run into errors.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if a church has the leading, the power, and the authority of the Holy Spirit, it can forgive men's sins, and God will honor such forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the church retains men's sins, God will also honor such retaining.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is God forgiving through men's forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But only those who have the power of the Holy Spirit can have the authority to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God wants man to declare His forgiveness on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church, the workers of God, and the apostles are the representatives of God on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God declares man's forgiveness through such people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not to say that a man has any authority in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church cannot forgive men.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the church can ascertain whether or not a man's sins are forgiven through the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God forgives through the hand of man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eternal forgiveness has to do with life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As soon as a person is forgiven, he is regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But instrumental forgiveness is related to a corporate entity, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is the church that determines whether or not a man is qualified to be a part of it.</S>
