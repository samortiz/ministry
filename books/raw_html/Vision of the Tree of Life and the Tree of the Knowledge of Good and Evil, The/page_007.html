        <h2 class="head1">GOD DEALING WITH THE TREE<br />
OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</h2>
<p>The first two chapters of Genesis should have been connected directly to the last two chapters of Revelation. But as a result of the fall of man, the Bible makes a detour in Genesis 3 that continues through Revelation 20. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, representing Satan, came in during this detour. Satan came in to tempt man. As a result of the fall, sin entered, man gained a record of sin before God, man became flesh, and death entered into the world. Satan, sin, the record of sin, the flesh, the world, and death have been working to frustrate God and man. Man went astray in Genesis 3. The struggles between God and Satan are in this detour, which is the result of man eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It is not until Revelation 20, when Satan is cast first into the abyss (vv. 2-3) and then into the lake of fire (v. 10) and when death, the last enemy brought in by Satan, is cast into the lake of fire (v. 14), that the tree of knowledge is completely dealt with. The detour is the issue of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This tree came in in Genesis 3 and was dealt with in Revelation 20.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO LONGER TAKING THE DETOUR<br />
OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>We no longer need to follow the detour today, for the Lord has opened the way to the tree of life. However, the condition of most Christians is that they are still in the detour. If we do not have a revelation of the tree of life, we will exhort people saying, &ldquo;Brother, you need to be watchful. Sister, you should be subject to your husband. We must deal with the flesh, accept the breaking, and accept the cross. We need to be like Madame Guyon.&rdquo; Such exhortations are in the detour of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Even Madame Guyon was in this detour. She pursued the Lord and was built up, but eventually God still had to strip everything away. When she was stripped by God, she could say, &ldquo;I am as nothing, and rejoice to be / Emptied, and lost, and swallow&rsquo;d up in Thee&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #546). There is no need for a redundant step. It is better to not build than to build up and then tear down. God stripped her of everything and left only Himself. Therefore, she said that she was lost in Him. However, these words do not hit the mark. Man is not lost in God but mingled with God. By God&rsquo;s mercy Madame Guyon touched this reality, but she did not have sufficient light and did not know the confirming word in the Scriptures.</p>
<p>A person who takes the detour must eventually come out. The detour is about doing things. The Lord has enlightened us to see that we do not need to take this detour. The Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst&rdquo; (John 6:35). He also said, &ldquo;He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing&rdquo; (15:5). These verses reveal that there is no need to stay in the detour. We need only to eat and drink the Lord: &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (6:57). How I wish I could repeat these verses until every believer sees that man needs nothing but to eat and enjoy the Lord. A. B. Simpson said that everything is in Christ and that Christ is everything (<em>Hymns,</em> #513). Healing is Christ, power is Christ, and patience is Christ; everything is Christ. But his words did not yet hit the mark and are not very clear. No one has ever told people, &ldquo;God needs man to eat Him; man needs to eat God.&rdquo; Only this word hits the mark and is clear.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE TELLING US TO CONTACT<br />
THE TREE OF LIFE AND TAKE GOD AS OUR FOOD</h2>
<p>The picture at the beginning of the Bible shows that God has been manifested as food. After man was created, he was put in front of the tree of life, which is the embodiment of God. The fruit of the tree of life as man&rsquo;s food signifies that God came in the form of food to be man&rsquo;s life. However, when God became flesh and lived on the earth, those around Him were filled with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Hence, they only asked what they should do and how they should work (John 6:28). But the Lord Jesus said that He came to be food: He is the bread which came down out of heaven for man to eat (vv. 51, 55, 57-58).</p>
<p>The parables that the Lord Jesus spoke concerning salvation are centered on eating. For example, in Matthew 22 the Lord Jesus spoke of a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son and sent his slaves to call people to eat, saying, &ldquo;My oxen and my fatted cattle have been slain, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast&rdquo; (v. 4). A person goes to such a feast to eat, not to do something. In the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15, the father of the prodigal son said, &ldquo;Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry&rdquo; (v. 23). Before the Lord was crucified, He took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body.&rdquo; And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26-28). This indicates that all the Lord&rsquo;s teachings are centered on His being food for man to eat and drink. Hence, He said, &ldquo;So he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (John 6:57).</p>
<p>In addition, Peter says that we can taste that the Lord is good (1 Pet. 2:3). On the day of Pentecost the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit, but others saw them as being full of new wine (Acts 2:13). Such filling with the Holy Spirit can be considered as drinking; it is a matter of eating and drinking. Paul says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine...but be filled in spirit&rdquo; (Eph. 5:18). In other words, we should no longer drink wine but should instead drink the Spirit. We should not be drunk with wine, but we should be filled with the Spirit. There is no concept of doing or working in these verses. There is no human effort; instead, there is only eating and drinking.</p>
<p>If we do not take God as food and enjoy Him as our life, we will leave the tree of life, for even a little mixture will turn us to the detour. The way of the detour is complicated. This way has everything&mdash;good, bad, right, wrong, the things of God, and the things of Satan. We must see that we do not need to take the detour. We must be people who eat, drink, and enjoy God. This is the straight way. We do not need to think of the problems of sin, the record of sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, or death. We need only to enjoy God. When He is in us, He will deal with all the problems for us. This is the principle of Romans 8: the law of the Spirit of life frees us from the law of sin and of death (v. 2). This law in us is responsible for everything.</p>
<p>The tree of life does not depend on our spiritual cultivation, morning watch, or anything else; it depends on our enjoying God, absorbing Him, eating Him, and drinking Him. The Lord Jesus went through the detour on our behalf to become the life-giving Spirit. Now He contains all the elements that meet our needs. We need only to enjoy Him, appropriate Him, eat Him, drink Him, and live by trusting in Him. Then the problems will be dealt with, and God&rsquo;s intention will be fulfilled.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
