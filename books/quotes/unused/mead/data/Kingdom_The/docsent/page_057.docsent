   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TARES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are three other parables found in Matthew 13: the parables of the tares, the mustard seed, and the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These three parables, along with the parable of the sower, form one group.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are all related to the vegetable life and to farming.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the first parable the sower sows the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the second parable the tares appear, also growing on the farm.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the third parable, there is a mustard seed growing in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the fourth parable, meal is made from the grains of wheat produced by the field.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, these four parables concern one growth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are related to one another and should not be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen that God's intention is to sow Christ into us as life so that He can grow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This growth process is the coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, Satan, God's enemy, never sleeps.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is always busy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once he saw that God's farm was growing wheat, he came in to sow false seed, the tares 13:24-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Prior to this, he had already caused considerable damage.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, he had appeared as a bird, snatching away the seed from the wayside.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Praise the Lord that some seed was sown into the field.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet, underneath some of the earth were rocks the unrenewed mind, emotions, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are Satan-saturated elements in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Satan-saturated mind, will, and emotions are hard rocks beneath the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Outwardly, Satan was unable to snatch away the word, but inwardly he held to the mind, emotions, and will, causing them to be huge rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then Satan worked to produce thorns, causing the anxiety of this life, the love for money, and the deceit of riches to choke the growth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that Satan, the subtle one, is constantly busy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He snatches away the seed, he hardens people, and he causes thorns to spring up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, regardless of all the damage that Satan could do, God still gained the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There was some good ground which produced wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After this, Satan came in to sow false seed, the tares, into the field.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many years ago I read an article which said that even an expert cannot tell the difference between tares and wheat until the blade appears.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, it is only after the fruit appears that anyone can discern between the wheat and the tares.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The tares resemble the wheat in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The difference is clearly evident only after the fruit appears.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The genuine wheat brings forth the ears; the tares produce something else, something false.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time it is easy to tell the difference between tares and wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Satan was very subtle to produce the counterfeit, false Christians, and plant them among the genuine Christians to confuse the situation and frustrate the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all must be alert.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan sowed the tares while men slept, meaning they were not alert.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In all the churches we must be alert, making it difficult for Satan to sow the false seed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan himself will never sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regardless of how good a church is, he will attempt to sow the false seed, to grow something which closely resembles the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will choke and frustrate the growth of the real wheat, and confuse the condition of God's farm.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people may make a certain suggestion, and this may be a sign that they are tares and not real wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they first appeared, they had the same appearance as everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even an expert could not discern whether they were genuine or false until the day that they made a certain suggestion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then some began to realize that they might be tares.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the churches the leading ones must be especially alert not to be cheated by tares.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Satan will try to sow tares to cause confusion, frustration, and damage, and to hinder the growth of the real wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must be careful of anyone who suggests something which will frustrate the growth of the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That may be the sign of a tare.</S>
