   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e Being Promised to by God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the First Time</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>None of God's dealings is without a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every time we suffer a dealing there will be a promise along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more dealings we suffer, the more promises we shall have.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 28:13-15 we see God's promise to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Jacob's experience, God's promise did not come before His dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The promise is not firstly that we shall be provided with food and raiment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It firstly is that we shall have the land and the seed and that we shall be a blessing to all the families of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see three things the land, the seed, and the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the consistent revelation of the Bible, the land is for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In His creation, God created man in His own image and gave him dominion over the earth, over the land.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the land is for the dominion, the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The seed is for the expression, for the spreading of the image.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 28:13 and 14 we have the same two things that are found in Genesis 1:26 image and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After this, we become a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our blessing is simply Christ, for Christ becomes our blessing to others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we examine our experience, we shall see that whenever we suffered or had some dealing from God, we received the land and had the sense that we were in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, we sensed that something of God was expressed through us and was spreading out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In addition to this, we became a blessing to others, to our neighbors, relatives, friends, and everyone around us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's promise was not only given to Jacob; in principle, it is also given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we are under God's dealing, we participate in the land, the seed, and the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We share in the territory and the expression of God and we become a blessing to others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God knows our need.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 15 He said to Jacob, "Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here God was promising to give Jacob food and clothing and to bring him back to his father's land in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The people in religion know nothing about the land, the seed, and the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Often when they give a testimony, they say something like this: "Praise the Lord that His presence is always with me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Recently, I took a tour of Chicago and God's presence was with me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Throughout all the years He has been giving me food, clothes, and all that I need."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have hardly ever heard a testimony in which someone said, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After God dealt with me, my territory has been enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God has truly been transforming me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is spreading His expression through me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What a blessing has followed this!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>f His Reaction 1 Calling the Place the House of God</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we come to Jacob's reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Firstly, after waking out of his sleep, he called that place the house of God v. 17 . Where did Jacob get the concept of the house of God? Abraham did not know of this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we have pointed out, we do not find this term before Genesis 28.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all lived in tents.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why then did Jacob not say the tent of God but rather the house of God?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Surely this is not only a dream but a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although Jacob did not actually see the house of God, he termed what he saw the house of God, saying, "This is the house of God."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Certainly this came from divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has revealed His economy not only in clear words but also in the lives of human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jacob, a man living altogether on the human level, had a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In that dream he saw something, and after he awoke he said, "This is the house of God."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Undoubtedly, this concept of the house of God came from God Himself.</S>
