   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WE BEING THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST CONSTITUTING HIS BODY AS HIS INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must remember what kind of people we are.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have God who came into us through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only so, we have also entered into God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a glorious fact.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus and called upon His name, we received the Lord Jesus into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can testify that before we believed in the Lord and called upon His name, we were empty within.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, once we believe in the Lord, there is something within us that burns, shines, rebukes, encourages, and comforts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Who is this?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was incarnated, passed through human living, died, resurrected, and ascended, and today He has come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is too wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He comes into us, we become His multiplication and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What are Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christians are people who have received the living Jesus into them to make them the duplication of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we are His multiplication and His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, we have become a part of Him; we have become members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consider the four major limbs and the other hundreds of members in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Each member is a part of our body, that is, a part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must realize that today we are a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Individually we are His members, and corporately we are His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am expressed through my own body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I did not have a body, if I were a spirit or a soul floating in the air, you could neither see nor touch me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, if you heard my speaking, you all would become frightened and run away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, since I have a body to express me in an appropriate way, when I speak boldly, you can enjoy my speaking and not be the least bit afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, Christ needs a church to be His Body in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His Body is not small as ours is; it is all-inclusive, and the believers in it are of all sorts of nationalities and races.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is also eternal and boundless; no one can count the number of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is needless to speak of those who have passed away; even the number of the living ones is hard to estimate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If today we arrive at a figure, by tomorrow morning another group of believers will be produced, and before we can finish counting them, still another group will be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Can we say how many people repent and believe in the Lord every day all over the globe?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason the Body is eternal and boundless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Dear brothers and sisters, you must definitely know that you should not be religionists.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, you must be included in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You must be His multiplication and His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not merely to live for Jesus; this is to live as Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To me, to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I still exist, but this "I" has passed through death and has been resurrected.</S>
