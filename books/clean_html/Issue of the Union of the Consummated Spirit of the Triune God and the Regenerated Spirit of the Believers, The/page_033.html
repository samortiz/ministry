<P>After the first group of apostles, in church history there were the so-called church fathers, who defended the truths. However, among the church fathers, because of inadequate light, there was always much contention concerning the truths. It was not until A.D. 325 that, for the sake of maintaining the order in his empire, the Roman emperor Constantine the Great came forward to intervene by calling a meeting at Nicaea in order to quiet the contentions among the church fathers. At that time there was a young theologian named Athanasius, who was a student under the church fathers. A sentence that he spoke, "God became man that man may become God," shocked everyone, and it has become a famous quote in church history. The Nicene Creed, which he helped to draft, was not bad in presenting the orthodox and fundamental doctrines concerning God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. It is still used by the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches. Although this creed is good, in terms of the truth it is still very lacking. Hence, the Nicene Council did not completely solve the problems concerning the truths.</P><P>The knowledge concerning the consummated Spirit of the Triune God has been very lacking for centuries. For example, the seventeenth century edition of the King James Version of the Bible still uses the impersonal pronoun it in referring to the Holy Spirit because the translators viewed the Holy Spirit as an instrument to be used by God, and not as a person ranked equally with the other two in the Divine Trinity. Two centuries later, when the British Brethren were raised up by the Lord, they pointed out clearly that the Holy Spirit is a person. This was because the word of the Lord Jesus clearly mentioned "the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Matt. 28:19), and the church fathers long before had acknowledged the Holy Spirit as a person in the Godhead. The English translations after the nineteenth century began gradually to adopt the personal pronoun He in referring to the Holy Spirit.</P><P>In the twentieth century the Lord's recovery has reached us. Beginning with Brother Nee, we have read through the Bible thoroughly. We have especially dug out all the verses in the Bible concerning the Holy Spirit. Concerning the consummated Spirit, the Lord has shown us three crucial points. First, the Spirit of God has been processed to become a life-giving Spirit (John 7:39; 1 Cor. 15:45b). Second, this consummated Spirit is the compound Spirit typified by the holy anointing ointment in the Old Testament (Exo. 30:23-25). Third, this Spirit has also become the seven Spirits (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6), that is, the sevenfold intensified Spirit. These three points were not mentioned in the Nicene Creed.</P><P>The Lord has caused us to receive much revelation in the Bible. In order for us to present these revelations, we have invented many new terms. An example of a new term invented by us is the processed and consummated Triune God. The church fathers long ago used the term the Triune God. Although this term is not in the Bible, the fact that God is triune is definitely in the Bible. Both processed and consummated are terms that had never been used in the history of Christianity before us. However, no one can deny that God has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, ultimately producing a consummation, that is, the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>Today many Christians have never heard of the processed and consummated God. Hence, what they are preaching is the unprocessed God in Genesis chapter one. However, what we have seen is the consummated God in Revelation chapter twenty-two. At the end the Bible says, "The Spirit and the bride say..." (Rev. 22:17). The Spirit is the processed and consummated God; the bride is the processed and consummated church. The two are joined to be a loving pair in eternity. The final word of the Bible is the highest authority for defining the truth. The Lord in His recovery has already shown us the highest truth defined by the Bible.</P>
