[1]  A Brief Definition of the Kingdom of the Heavens CONTENTS
[2]  We hope that this book will be read with much prayer and that its contents will encourage us to run the race with endurance 1 Cor 9:24-27; Heb 12:1 , to pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus Phil 3:12-14 , looking to the Lord to save us unto His heavenly kingdom 2 Tim 4:18 that we might be awarded the crown of righteousness in that day 2 Tim 4:8 , the day of Christ s second appearing when He will reward each man according to his doings Matt 16:27 and his work Rev22:12 .
[3]  IN THE BIBLE Scripture Reading: Gen 12:1-2; Matt 6:9-10; Exo 19:4-6; Rev 11:15; Matt 21:43; 3:2; 4:17; 10:5-7; 12:28; 16:19; 13:3, 24, 31, 33; 19:23-24; John 3:3, 5; Matt 5:20; 7:21; 18:3; Acts 1:3; 8:12; 14:22; Rom 14:17; 1 Cor 6:9-10; 15:50; Gal 5:21; Eph 5:5; 2 Thes 1:5; Rev 12:10; 2 Tim 4:18 THE DIVINE IMAGE
[4]  If we are to have the full image of God to express God and to realize the full authority to represent God, to subdue His enemy, to subdue this earth, God Himself must be our life.
[5]  For example, the United States as a nation, a kingdom, is not a simple matter.
[6]  Matthew 13 is another proof that the kingdom of the heavens started when the church began to be built.
[7]  In the first parable in Matthew 13 the Lord says, Behold, the sower went out to sow v. 3 . In the second parable, however, He says, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field.
[8]  In the third parable the Lord tells us that the kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed v. 31 . The fourth parable tells us that the kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened v. 33 . The previous three parables of Matthew 13 always begin with the clause the kingdom of the heavens is or, has become like..., but with the first parable there is not such a clause.
[9]  With the second parable the Lord began to say, the kingdom of the heavens is or, has become like, because the kingdom of the heavens began to be established when the church was built 16:18-19 on the day of Pentecost, the time when the second parable began to be fulfilled.
[10]  Matthew 19:23 says that it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
[11]  In John 3:3 and 5, though, the Lord reveals that the only requirement for entering the kingdom of God is to be born again.
[12]  If you have been born again, you have entered into the kingdom of God.
[13]  To enter into the kingdom of God requires regeneration as a new beginning of our life, but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens demands surpassing righteousness in our living after regeneration.
[14]  Other verses which show us that the kingdom of God has not been suspended are 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, 1 Corinthians 15:50, Galatians 5:21, Ephesians 5:5, 2 Thessalonians 1:5, Revelation 11:15, 12:10, and 2 Timothy 4:18 which says, The Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will save me into His heavenly kingdom, to whom be the glory forever and ever.
[15]  The kingdom of the heavens is something different from the kingdom of God, yet the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God because it is a part of the kingdom of God.
[16]  The victorious Christians who are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, the defeated believers who are in the church yet not in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, the false Christians who are merely Christians in name but not members of the true church, and the world composed of all the unbelievers are the four groups of people on the earth today.
[17]  THE APPEARANCE WITH THE REALITY The Parable of the Sower
[18]  In Matthew 13 the first parable is the parable of the sower: And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow v. 3 . This parable does not mention the kingdom of the heavens, because at this time the kingdom of the heavens had not come yet.
[19]  A fifth parable says, The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and in his joy goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field Matt 13:44 .
[20]  In the Scriptures, the sea denotes the world corrupted by Satan Isa 57:20; Rev 17:15 , and the field represents the earth created by God for His kingdom Gen 1:26-28 .
[21]  The treasure hidden in the field signifies the kingdom hidden in God s created world.
[22]  CHAPTER THREE LIFE UNDER THE KINGDOM S RULE Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[23]  In Romans 14:17 the apostle Paul tells us that the kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
[24]  When the Lord Jesus comes back, surely the apostle Paul will be transferred into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens and rule as a king with the Lord Jesus, because he already lived in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.
[25]  When the Lord Jesus comes back, the apostle Paul will inherit the manifestation of the kingdom.
[26]  The second parable in Matthew 25, the parable of the talents, shows the same principle.
[27]  CHAPTER FOUR EXERCISE AND DISCIPLINE FOR THE KINGDOM Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:12-15; Luke 12:42-47; Acts 14:22; John 3:5; 1 Cor 5:1, 5; 6:9-10; Eph 5:3-5; Gal 5:19-21; 2 Thes 1:5; 1 Cor 9:24-27; Phil 3:13-15; 2 Tim 4:1, 7-8, 18 THE ETERNAL LIFE OF GOD
[28]  The kingdom truths have much to do with the inner life as well as the church life.
[29]  The kingdom is also related to the wisdom and justice of God.
[30]  Without the kingdom, God s wisdom and justice cannot be proved to the fullest extent.
[31]  Now let us read Luke 12:42-47: And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom the master will set over his service to give them their portion of food at the proper time?
[32]  Many verses in the New Testament show the need of exercise for the kingdom.
[33]  Acts 14:22 says, Establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith and saying that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.
[34]  John 3:5 simply says that by being born of water and the Spirit we can enter into the kingdom of God.
[35]  But whether or not we will be able to share in the manifestation of the kingdom is the problem.
[36]  OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:10; Rom 14:10; 1 Cor 10:32; Zech 13:8-9; 8:20-23; Rev 14:6-7; Matt 25:31-46; Rev 21:24; 22:2-5
[37]  However, we must be clear concerning the matters of the kingdom.
[38]  Now let us consider how the Lord will deal with the Jews at His coming back.
[39]  If by fearing and worshipping God the nations have well-treated the Christians, the Lord s brothers suffering poverty and imprisonment under Antichrist s persecution during the great tribulation, they will be justified by the Lord so that they may enter into the earthly part of the millennium to partake of the kingdom prepared by God for them from the foundation of the world v. 34 . If they have ill-treated them by following Antichrist and worshipping his image, they will be condemned and be cast into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels vv.
[40]  Thus far, we have seen that in the millennium the overcoming Christians are the kings, the saved Israelites are the priests, and the nations are the people who obeyed the eternal gospel during the great tribulation.
