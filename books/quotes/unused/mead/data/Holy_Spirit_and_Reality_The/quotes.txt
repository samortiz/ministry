[1]  CONTENTS The Holy Spirit and Reality Appendix Obsession and God's Light
[2]  The message in this book touches a great matter in the Christian life the Holy Spirit and reality.
[3]  With concrete examples, it demonstrates that behind everything spiritual there is the reality.
[4]  God's children must realize that in God's eyes, every spiritual thing and matter has its reality.
[5]  If we merely touch the outward appearance without touching the reality, what we touch has no spiritual value.
[6]  Although spiritual reality is manifested through our behavior, human performance is not reality.
[7]  If a man touches spiritual reality in the Holy Spirit, he will immediately respond when others touch spiritual reality; he will immediately say amen.
[8]  The same is true with the breaking of bread.
[9]  On the night the Lord Jesus was betrayed, "Jesus took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body.
[10]  But the emphasis in the Word of God is not on a change in substance or on the matter of representation, it is on a spiritual reality.
[11]  Following this, Paul said, "Seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body" v. 17, ASV . He could not have said this if he had not touched the spiritual reality.
[12]  John 4 tells us that "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness" v. 24 . We have pointed out previously that the word "truthfulness" can be translated as "reality." The emphasis is the spirit, but it also mentions reality.
[13]  When the spirit touches God, there is reality; when the spirit does not touch God, there is no reality.
[14]  Romans 6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ v. 6 . This is a fact.
[15]  Some Christians say, "I know that my old man is crucified, but I do not know why my old man is still living today."
[16]  The reason for this is that they have touched a doctrine; they have not touched the spiritual reality.
[17]  We must realize that if a doctrine is in letters and not in the Holy Spirit, we will not receive any life even if we know all about it.
[18]  A doctrine must be in the Holy Spirit before it can become a spiritual reality.
[19]  When we touch the spiritual reality, we touch life, and it is living and fresh.
[20]  Otherwise, even if there are extensive quotations and references, and even if all the logic is right, those who know reality will still say that it is not reality.
[21]  The disciples' knowledge of the Lord Jesus in the beginning was outward knowledge; they did not have an inward knowledge of Him.
[22]  Men like Thomas and Philip were with the Lord for a long time.
[23]  Yet Thomas said to the Lord, "Lord, we do not know where You are going; how can we know the way?"
[24]  The Lord clearly said, "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him."
[25]  In the eyes of God, if a man does not have the Holy Spirit, he has not touched the reality of the Lord Jesus even if he has memorized the Lord's history and even if he has pressed upon Him, heard His voice, knelt before Him, and prayed to Him.
[26]  If we know Christ in a real way through the Spirit and touch the spiritual reality of Christ, we will have an inward knowledge, even though we may not be able to articulate or explain it.
[27]  He has forgiven generously, but we inwardly feel that something is not right; it seems that the forgiveness is too deliberate; it does not feel like the real thing.
[28]  We must remember that in God's eyes, there is something called reality.
[29]  The problem with many Christians is that they try to do something to make things real.
[30]  But God does not require us to imitate; He only wants the reality, the real thing, to be manifested through us.
[31]  At the most, a man who does this has outward conduct; he does not have the real thing, and what he has is not the reality.
[32]  We must ask God to help us so that we would touch the reality behind all spiritual things.
[33]  Once we are touched and dealt with by God in a certain matter, once we touch something real, and once we know the way God's Spirit moves within, we will know immediately when we touch a person whether he acts by himself or by the Spirit of God.
[34]  Second Corinthians 4 shows us clearly that where there is reality, there is the supply.
[35]  Paul said, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body" v. 10 . This shows us that when the death of Jesus is manifested, His life is also manifested.
[36]  It is a pity that many Christians are still living in outward appearances!
[37]  There seems to be a supply only when they work, but this supply stops once their work stops.
[38]  But when they do not open their mouths, they are no longer the best servants of God.
[39]  If we do not see any spiritual reality, we will have many questions.
[40]  The revelation of the Holy Spirit shows us the spiritual reality, while the discipline of the Holy Spirit leads us, through the ordering in the environment, into all spiritual reality.
[41]  The goal of the work of the Spirit is to lead us into that which is real, the reality.
[42]  On the one hand, the Spirit gives us the revelation and brings us into that which is real so that we will see what we are in Christ.
[43]  The reason lies in the lack of discipline from the Spirit and the lack of restrictions of the Spirit.
[44]  They do not have a history before God, and the Holy Spirit has no opportunity to manifest the reality of Christ through them or to wrought Christ into them.
[45]  APPENDIX OBSESSION AND GOD'S LIGHT Scripture Reading: Isa 50:10-11; Psa 36:9
[46]  In the Old Testament, there is one book which shows us what obsessed people are like.
[47]  It is a pitiful and tragic thing to be obsessed.
[48]  There are always reasons for Christians to be obsessed.
[49]  Isaiah 50:10-11 says, "Who among you fears Jehovah;/ Who hears the voice of His servant;/Who walks in darkness/ And has no light?/Let him trust in the name of Jehovah,/And rely on his God./Behold, all of you who kindle a fire,/Who surround yourselves with firebrands,/Walk into the light of your fire/And into the firebrands which you have lit./You will have this from My hand:/You will lie down in torment."
[50]  You may think that you are not wrong, you may feel that you are not wrong, and you may believe that you are not wrong, but are you reliable?
