   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Over one thousand years ago, Russia was a wild country without a written language or a civilized culture.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then the Greek missionaries of the Greek Orthodox Church went to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today in the Russian alphabet, there are a number of Greek letters because some Greek missionaries made an alphabet for the people of Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Russian Orthodox Church was established about ten centuries ago.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This foundation of Russian orthodoxy was deeply laid.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even the communists, including Lenin and Stalin, could not shake this foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the end of the seventeenth century, Peter the Great rose up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before his time, Russia was basically an oriental culture in things such as their way of dress and in their eating.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was Peter the Great who revolutionized their civilization.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He westernized Russia, and their way of clothing and eating was changed to the western style.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They became western European, yet they were largely in the Asian territory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>History tells us that eventually, the royal family of Russia, the clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church, and the landlords all became corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the First World War, the czar sent his troops to fight against Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This gave Lenin the opportunity to stir up the peasants to revolt against the existing czarist government.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1917 they were able to carry out their communist revolution.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now that communist rule is over in Russia, the door is wide open for the spreading of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In principle we have to go to meet the Lord's need in Russia, but we should not do it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the churches, we should consider what percentage of our people have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We cannot send everybody; otherwise, we will suffer too much loss.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The leading ones have to consider who is more useful here at home and who is more useful for the migration to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why we like to receive the applications for those who desire to go to Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The saints can apply, but we have to discern and consider who should stay and who should go.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Also, we have to consider the financial support.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To support one missionary to work in Russia requires over one thousand dollars a month.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have one hundred going, we have to prepare one hundred thousand dollars a month for their support.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This would amount to one million two hundred thousand dollars a year.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This amount includes their lodging, their traveling, their furniture, their meeting places, and many other things related to the practical carrying out of the work there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our present capacity among the saints for the financial support of the workers in Russia is not that high.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the beginning of our move to Russia, a large amount of offerings came in, but the offerings have decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to realize that the amount of offerings will not increase unless the Lord comes in to perform some miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, we have to consider the number of persons who can go in light of the capacity of our financial ability.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, if some saints desire to go, they have to consider their future.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They have to consider their age, their family, how many children they have, how many children they are expecting to have, and the age of their children and how they will be educated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Concerning the work in Russia, we do not know what tomorrow will bring.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It could be that after five years, the Russians will not be that open.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their mind may become full of other things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are a very capable, learned, and knowledgeable people with a strong character.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only the Lord knows how long this opening in Russia will last.</S>
