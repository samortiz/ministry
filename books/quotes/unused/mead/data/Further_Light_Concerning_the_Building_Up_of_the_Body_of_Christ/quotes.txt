[1]  Further Light Concerning the Building Up of the Body of Christ CONTENTS
[2]  OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 19, 22b-26, 31, 39a
[3]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for Your sovereignty and for Your sovereign grace so that we could have this conference.
[4]  The fellowship in this book is a continuation of the fellowship in recent books concerning the Body of Christ as an organism and concerning the building up of the Body of Christ organically see The Body of Christ, The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity, and The Building Up of the Body of Christ published by Living Stream Ministry .
[5]  First Corinthians reveals the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ.
[6]  We need to enjoy Christ every day according to what is revealed of Him in 1 Corinthians.
[7]  Christ is our portion in His fellowship 1:2b, 9 .
[8]  First Corinthians is a book of enjoying Christ, but what is the reason for us to enjoy Christ, and what is the issue of enjoying Christ?
[9]  Our enjoyment of Christ is also for developing our gifts to speak for Christ to build up the Body of Christ organically.
[10]  We need to enjoy Christ that we may be developed in our spiritual function to speak the Christ that we have enjoyed and experienced in order to exhibit Him in the meeting for the building up of the Body organically.
[11]  We can see from the following verses in 1 Corinthians 14 that the apostle encouraged prophesying:
[12]  These gifted ones not only feed the saints but also perfect them, equip them, furnish them, that the saints may do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ in an organic way.
[13]  First Corinthians 14:12 says that we have to seek to speak for the Lord by the excelling Holy Spirit Since you are zealous of spirits lit.
[14]  , seek that you may excel to the building up of the church.
[15]  The top function for the building up of the Body of Christ is to speak for the Lord.
[16]  To speak for Christ, to speak Christ forth, to speak Christ into others, is to practice a function that excels.
[17]  CHAPTER TWO THE APOSTLES AND THE PROPHETS PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS Scripture Reading: Eph 4:11-16
[18]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for this meeting.
[19]  We worship You for Your speaking daily and hourly to all of us.
[20]  We must speak Christ, Christ, Christ, and more Christ.
[21]  The apostles perfected the saints firstly by visiting the churches Acts 15:36, 40-41 .
[22]  Later Paul desired to return to these churches again and he said to Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brothers throughout every city in which we announced the word of the Lord, and see how they are getting along 15:36 .
[23]  In Paul s talk with the elders in Ephesus in Acts 20, Paul said that he taught them publicly and from house to house v. 20 . To teach the saints publicly, no doubt, indicates that he taught them in a meeting.
[24]  The apostles perfecting work was also carried out by their writing epistles to the churches.
[25]  In his Epistle to the Galatians, he unveiled Christ to the saints and labored on them that Christ might be formed in them 1:16a; 4:19 .
[26]  In his Epistles, Paul also ministered Christ and His riches to the saints for the building up of the church to accomplish God s eternal economy Eph 3:8-10 .
[27]  Paul ministered Christ and His unsearchable riches to the saints in his writing, especially in Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.
[28]  In his Epistles, Paul warned and taught the saints to present each of them to God full-grown in Christ Col 1:28 .
[29]  According to the record of the New Testament, it is not adequate for a prophet merely to visit a church.
[30]  He must stay with a church in order to perfect the saints.
[31]  The prophets were in the church in Antioch to perfect the saints to speak for the Lord.
[32]  The ones among us who have learned to speak the Lord as prophets should stay in a certain church to perfect the saints.
[33]  The prophets perfect the saints by teaching them to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into people to do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ, as the prophets do.
[34]  He would tell the saints that since we all love the Lord, and we know that the Lord desires to build up His Body by our growth in life, we must have a daily revival.
[35]  We have seen that to build up the Body of Christ, the best gift, the excelling gift, is to prophesy.
[36]  In 1 Corinthians there is the principle of speaking Christ but not the details concerning how to help and make all the saints speak forth Christ.
[37]  When all the saints exercise to speak Christ in the church meetings, however, the Body of Christ is built up.
[38]  Even if the person speaking in the traditional way knows how to speak Christ and minister Christ to the audience, his capability and riches can never replace the capability and the riches of the many members of the Body of Christ.
[39]  An evangelist perfects the saints by stirring them up to be burning in the gospel-preaching spirit.
[40]  The evangelists preach Christ, the unsearchable riches of Christ, and the kingdom of God as the gospel in the way of dispensing for the building up of the Body of Christ, and they teach the saints to do the same thing Acts 5:42; Eph 3:8; Acts 8:12 .
[41]  We have to preach Christ as the gospel according to Acts 5:42; we have to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel according to Ephesians 3:8; and we have to preach the kingdom of God as the gospel according to Acts 8:12.
[42]  CHAPTER FOUR AN ORGANIC BUILDING Scripture Reading: Eph 4:13-16 THE VISION OF THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP
[43]  Verse 13 says, Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[44]  The faith refers to what we believe in, which is mainly the redemptive work of Christ, the completed work of Christ.
[45]  In Matthew 16 the Lord asked the disciples, Who do you say that I am? v. 15 . Peter answered, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . Then the Lord told Peter that he was blessed because flesh and blood had not revealed this to him but His Father in the heavens v. 17 . Peter received the revelation that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[46]  This organic building is realized by our growing in life.
[47]  If we are going to perfect others, we must help them to grow in life.
[48]  In order to be perfected, we must grow not in our natural life but in the divine life, in the life of God which is Christ.
[49]  We have to hold to the processed Triune God and His New Testament economy, which is the dispensation arrangement of God s hidden mystery Eph 3:9 to have a church to be the Body of Christ Eph 3:10; 1:23 .
[50]  Finally, we have to hold to the church, the Body of Christ, an organism 1:23 , as the fullness of Christ to be His expression.
[51]  If we do not hold to the truth the processed Triune God and His New Testament economy, the all-inclusive Christ, and His Body, the organic church we cannot grow up into Christ, the Head.
[52]  When we have more of Christ wrought into us and interwoven into our being, we are growing in Christ and with Christ.
[53]  Through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation of each one part in its measure, the Body of Christ, being joined together and knit together, is built up as a whole, and this is the genuine building of the Body of Christ as an organism.
[54]  I am expecting to see meetings all over the earth in which everyone is speaking Christ, speaking forth Christ, speaking Christ into others in the way of dispensing Christ into others.
[55]  CHAPTER FIVE A CRUCIAL WORD AND TESTIMONIES Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:8-9; 4:1; Acts 20:24; 2 Tim 4:5; Col 4:17
[56]  We thank You for Your everlasting mercy, in which we live and in which You have come to us.
[57]  Terms such as enjoying Christ, experiencing Christ, and exhibiting Christ were not used by us before the Lord s recovery came to the United States.
[58]  We need to see the truth concerning the unique ministry of God s New Testament economy and many personal ministries.
[59]  The brothers in these places testified of their enjoyment of the Lord s blessing in the gospel preaching by visiting people in their homes, in the home meetings and the small group meetings, in the meetings according to 1 Corinthians 14:26, in the practice of prophesying speaking for the Lord in the church meetings of mutuality, and in the training for the Lord s up-to-date move.
[60]  The saints in the Philippines have also seen the Lord s blessing in His up-to-date move among them.
[61]  The church in Manila was the first church established in the Philippines in 1930 on the northern island of Luzon.
