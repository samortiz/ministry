   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For Us to Inherit God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ, the son of Abraham, brings us the divine blessing for us to inherit God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Galatians 3:29 says, "If you are of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abraham's seed is only one, Christ Gal 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, for us to be Abraham's seed we must be of Christ, that is, a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because we are one with Christ, we are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God's promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God to be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 26:18 refers to the believers' divine inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all that He has done, and all that He will do for His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ Col 2:9 , who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians 1:13 and 14 reveal that the Spirit is "the pledge of our inheritance."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is the pledge of this inheritance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>GOD'S COVENANTS WITH ABRAHAM AND DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament God made a covenant with Abraham Gen 12:2-3; 15:4-18; 17:1-2; 22:17-18 and also with David 2 Sam 7:8-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to understand how we may experience and enjoy Christ as the son of David and the son of Abraham, we need to consider these two covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Covenant with Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>the Covenant concerning the Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The covenant God made with Abraham concerned God's coming to be the blessing to His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This covenant is related to God's purpose in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God made mankind to be His vessels to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God made man in His own image and after His likeness so that man could contain God, taking God as his life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For man to take God as his life and life supply is the greatest blessing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, due to the fall, this great blessing was lost by man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although man fell, God could not give up His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan's doings cannot annul God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The created race had fallen, but God continued working to fulfill His purpose by coming to a chosen race.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The created race, the race of Adam, was a failure, so God came to another race, the chosen race, the race of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whereas Adam was the head of the created race, Abraham was the head of the chosen race.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God made a covenant with Abraham, and this covenant concerns God's being the enjoyment and everything to His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Galatians 3:14 indicates that the New Testament is the fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this fulfillment, the processed Triune God consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit is the blessing to God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the gospel, we have received the all-inclusive Spirit as God's consummation to be the life, life supply, and everything for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result of the covenant God made with Abraham, the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit has become our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Galatians 3:29 tells us that because we are of Christ, we are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What will we inherit?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We will inherit the processed Triune God consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we realize this, we will understand why Christ had to be the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ had to be the son of Abraham to fulfill God's covenant with Abraham so that God, after being processed, could be our blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now for us to enjoy Christ as the son of Abraham means that we enjoy the Triune God promised to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a matter of blessing.</S>
