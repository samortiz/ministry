   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This book concerning the overcomers is a continuation of our fellowship in the book entitled The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The burden for the messages in this book can be expressed in the following four sets of statements concerning the overcomers from the book of Revelation:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Set 1:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To him who overcomes, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God Rev 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To him who overcomes, I will give of the hidden manna Rev 2:17.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Set 2:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To him who overcomes, I will give a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written Rev 2:17.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God Rev 3:12.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Set 3:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To him who hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me Rev 3:20.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne Rev 3:21.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Set 4:</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations Rev 2:26.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces Rev 2:27.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The entire Scripture composed of sixty-six books concludes with two things: the overcomers and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are the two main items revealed in the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation 1 20 gives us a complete record of the overcomers, and the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 22 will be the issue, the coming out, the consummation, of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The New Jerusalem will be manifested in two stages.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first stage will be in the millennium, the one-thousand-year kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That will be the precursor of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, the second stage of the New Jerusalem in the eternal age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may ask, "What is the New Jerusalem?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we read Revelation thoroughly under the heavenly light, we can see that the New Jerusalem is the totality of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The overcomers will be the New Jerusalem in the coming age, the age of the millennium, as the precursor to the New Jerusalem in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only a relatively small part of the believers will be the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The majority of the believers genuine, regenerated, blood-washed believers will have been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the Lord's coming, He will take away only the overcomers, leaving the rest of the believers in another category because they will not have the maturity in His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the millennium the overcoming believers will be with Christ in the bright glory of the kingdom, whereas the defeated believers will suffer discipline in outer darkness Matt 8:12; 22:13; 25:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is so that they can be perfected for their maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For any crop to become matured, that crop needs to go through a certain process.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The process through which the immature believers will have to pass will not be pleasant but will be a period of discipline and punishment for one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though that will not be a pleasant process, it will complete God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All of these dear ones will be matured and perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the thousand years, the Lord will clear up the entire universe through His judgment at the great white throne Rev 20:11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then there will be the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The New Jerusalem in eternity will be greatly enlarged to include all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By then all the believers will be overcomers Rev 21:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The late ones will be later overcomers, whereas the overcomers in this age will be the earlier overcomers.</S>
