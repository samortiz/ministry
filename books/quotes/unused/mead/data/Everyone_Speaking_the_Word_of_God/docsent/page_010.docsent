   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Healthy and the Edifying Word</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the healthy word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some words are not healthy, but all healthy words contain life, and health pertains to life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No one would say that a house is healthy, for a house does not have life and therefore has nothing to do with health.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you desire to speak healthy words, you must have life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Healthy words surely are words with life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You must realize that in all the healthy food we eat there is the element of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The things you eat must have an organic nature in order to make you healthy and supply you with life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Paul wrote 1 Timothy, the church had entered into a dangerous period.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He knew that some had come out teaching differently; therefore, in chapter one he said to Timothy, I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently v. 3 . For the believers to receive the different teachings would be like their eating stones or lumps of coal; these things are not nutritious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul also said, Laying these things before the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be a good minister, first you yourself must eat nutritious and healthy food, and second, you must supply others with what you have eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes we talk at length with people, and we even quote verses from the Bible, but these things may all be husks.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must give people healthy food.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes we do not need to talk so much; simply to give people an egg or a glass of milk would be good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1948 I went to Foochow to hold a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the first meeting I was given a glass of Foochow orange juice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although I was very tired from speaking, after drinking that glass of Foochow orange juice I was immediately refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I told Brother Nee, Your Foochow orange juice is really wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, when you go out to speak, you must exercise to give people a glass of Foochow orange juice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not give them a large piece of sweet potato ; that may not be as nutritious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must learn to experience the words of God; they are nutritious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some of you have heard me preach for thirty-six years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have preached in Taiwan for thirty-six years, but not until recently did I mention to you the seventy weeks in Daniel chapter nine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why did I not mention this before?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because there is not much nutrition in the seventy weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, even though I mentioned this recently, I was not very interested in it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I was young I met with the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They taught this matter daily.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While I was with them, for years I experienced very little spiritual growth because the things I ate were not healthy enough.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I were to speak to you for a year concerning the seventy weeks, you would all die spiritually because you would all be eating unhealthy food.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we must exercise to select from the Bible words rich in nutrition, healthy words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These healthy words are the words of the Lord Jesus 1 Tim 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, we must speak words which edify people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ephesians 4:29 says, Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for needful building up, that it may give grace to those who hear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Grace is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Words which contain God are good words, and they will build up people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You young people often like to pry into other people s business.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This does not build up people, and this does not dispense God into people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Older people even the more like to inquire about others business.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a trap and a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here I am not only speaking the truth, but I am also speaking about our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not know how many times we have been entangled by Satan s snare.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By being entangled in this way, we hurt others and we also hurt ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Good Word and the Word of Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is most difficult to speak about the good word and the word of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We might guess that the good word refers to some lovely or beautiful words spoken by the Lord Jesus; perhaps this is what is meant by the good word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This may be somewhat close, but it is still not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word of righteousness is the most difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The book of Hebrews speaks of these two categories, the good word and the word of righteousness 6:5; 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this book Paul advised the Hebrew believers not to remain in the good word but to go forward to the word of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He likened the good word to milk and the word of righteousness to solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Word of Knowledge and the Word of Wisdom</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You all can differentiate between the word of knowledge and the word of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These are the two kinds of words mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12:8.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The deeper and higher word is the word of wisdom; the shallower and lower word is the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The words written by Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter one are somewhat general; thus they are the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They speak in a general way about the Lord Jesus dying for us, His accomplishing redemption for us, and His relationship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These are the words of general spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, in chapter two Paul said, But we speak wisdom...</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory vv.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This wisdom is the deep and mysterious things of Christ, which are also the deep and mysterious things of God v. 10 . In chapter three Paul speaks on the deep and mysterious things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In verse 9 he said, You are God s farm, God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What grows on a farm are vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How can vegetables become building materials?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Paul also said, I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow v. 6 . These words seem shallow and easy to understand, but their meaning is very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These are words of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, to speak concerning the crucifixion of Jesus, concerning verses such as John 3:16, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, and concerning the fact that we all are sinners these are words of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But whenever life is mentioned, that is something deep and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In 1 Corinthians, from chapters three through ten what is spoken are words of wisdom; it is deep and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In 6:17 Paul said that we the believers have become one spirit with the Lord; this is very difficult to speak about, and this is not shallow or easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to labor properly upon words such as these.</S>
