   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION ONE THE INITIAL PURSUIT AND SATISFACTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1:2 2:7</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This section is the key to the whole book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the spiritual principles are contained in this section.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It foreshadows all subsequent experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The lessons that follow are not new; rather, they are old lessons repeated in a deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spiritual experiences in the first section are smooth and easy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first consecration and revelation always appear to be smooth and easy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, this consecration and revelation may not be very dependable; there is the need for these experiences to pass through the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This section foreshadows the spiritual experiences that are coming.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After this section, everything will be tested until it becomes real.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first time a person experiences something, the impression may not be very deep; the second time, the experience may be more advanced and more sure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet the second experience may not be as sweet as the first.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the end the experience is the same as that which was encountered at the beginning; the banner is still love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The experience in this section is equivalent to the "Path of Light" in the book Spiritual Torrents; it is also equivalent to the "revival stage" in the book Four Planes of Spiritual Life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our personal experience can surely testify to this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I. YEARNING 1:2-3</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 2 says, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The kisses that one seeks after here are different from the kiss of the Father upon the neck Luke 15:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That kiss was a sign of forgiveness, and everyone who belongs to the Lord has received that kiss already.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The emphasis in the Song of Songs is the love relationship between the believers and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As such, forgiveness is an implicit fact.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, there is no mention of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Song of Songs does not speak of how a person turns from the position of a sinner to the position of a believer; rather, it speaks of how a believer turns from a position of thirst to a position of satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must remember this fact before we can understand the way the book begins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After a person is saved, we do not know how long it takes before there is a longing within him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, we do know that a longing arises when a saved person is awakened by the Holy Spirit and begins to seek after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the seeker is full of hunger and thirst, her mouth spontaneously utters, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She does not say who "him" is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But in her mind, there is only one "him"; it is the One she seeks after.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Prior to this, her relationship with the Lord was general, and she was deeply dissatisfied with it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now she hopes to have a more personal relationship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, she longs for a "kiss," which is a personal expression of love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No one can kiss two people at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A kiss is an expression of a personal relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, these kisses are not on the cheek, as were Judas's Matt 26:49 , nor on the feet, as were Mary's Luke 7:38, 45 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are the "kisses of his mouth," a sign of personal affection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A general relationship can no longer satisfy her.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She wants a personal relationship which no one else has.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This inward urge is the beginning of all progress.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Spiritual edification can never be separated from a pursuit that is based on hunger and thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the Holy Spirit has not put a real dissatisfaction with a general relationship and a pursuit for personal affection within a believer, he can never expect to have an intimate experience of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This pursuit is the basis for all future experience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not have such a hunger and thirst, we will only have a poetic song, and it will not be the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We pursue because we have received a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Holy Spirit has shown us a vision which ordinary men have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After we have received such a revelation, we find that "thy love is better than wine."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we long for the kisses of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Indeed, His love is better than wine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of everything that brings us joy, elation, and excitement, the Holy Spirit shows us that nothing can be compared to His love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of all that entices us under the sun, nothing can be compared to His love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once we have seen and known His love, is there anything under the sun that can compare with it?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 3 says, "Because of the savor of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Lord, You are the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has anointed You with the Holy Spirit, and You have received all kinds of ointment from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not only does God smell Your savor, but we smell it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have not heard about this savor from anyone, and we have not seen it in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, we are touched spontaneously with the loveliness of the savor of Your ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Thy name is as ointment poured forth."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Lord, You also have a name that attracts us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Through Your name, we are reminded that God has come.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The ointment has been poured out!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We realize that You have died!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Indeed, the ointment has been poured forth!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How precious is the name of Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Who can fathom the savor of this name?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"Therefore do the virgins love thee."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because of Yourself the ointment and Your name the ointment poured forth , the virgins love You.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They love You because of Yourself, and because of Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We cannot love a work, and we cannot love a power.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We can only love a person, one who has a personality.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We love You, and we are attracted by Yourself and Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although we have not yet fully perceived Your savor, what we have perceived is enough for us to love You.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The revelation of the person of the Lord invokes not only praise from men, but also love.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The beginning of love in everyone toward the Lord is a vision of His person.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>"The virgins" here are the "hidden ones" Psa 83:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They are the companions of the maiden, and they are equally chaste and earnest in seeking after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The maiden is not the only one who is walking on the spiritual pathway; she is only one among many virgins.</S>
