<h2 class=head1>II. THE SAVED ONES NEED TO COME TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</h2><p>Paul continued in 1 Timothy 2:4b, “and come to the full knowledge of the truth.” It is crucial to see the word “and.” We may only see that God desires all men to be saved, and neglect to see that God also desires that they come to the full knowledge of the truth. Getting saved is the initial step for men to be in God’s purpose. Men are not useful for the building up of the church unless they have come to the full knowledge of the truth. We also need to come to the full knowledge of the truth in order to help others come to the full knowledge of the truth. <p>The term full knowledge does not merely mean understanding; it includes understanding and experience. To really know that sugar is sweet, you must taste it. After tasting its sweetness, you will know sugar is sweet, experientially, and no one will be able to convince you otherwise. All men need to come to the full knowledge of the truth the same way. Too many people know only “hear-say” truth. They do not really know nor have they experienced the truth to the extent that no one could convince them otherwise. All should know the truth item by item, point by point, and also know it experientially, until they have come to the full knowledge of the truth.<h2 class=head1>III. THE LOCAL CHURCHES NEED TO BE ESTABLISHED IN EVERY CITY</h2><p>The Lord said, in Matthew chapter 16, that He will build the church—the ruling and overcoming church. The church is glorious (Eph. 5:27). The universal church is comprised of many local churches; therefore, local churches need to be established throughout all the earth. The local churches need to be built up with the Spirit and the Word. The churches should be full of God, essentially. They should be full of Christ as the testimony of Jesus. They should be full of the Spirit to express the Triune God as lampstands in the dark, evil, and perverse world. The Lord’s as well as our work is not complete until all of the preceding points have been accomplished.<h2 class=head1>IV. WE MUST PRAY FOR HIS MOVE</h2><p>The gospel of the kingdom must be preached to the whole inhabited earth in order for all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth, and for the local churches to be established throughout all the earth. This is God’s desire, Christ’s commission, and the Spirit’s work. We are co-laborers with God, partners of Christ, and the reprint of the Spirit to carry out this great purpose of God. <h2 class=head3>Hymn #1248</h2><h2 class=head3>(verse one)</h2><p class=hbody>Recall how David swore, “I’ll not come into my house, Nor go up to my bed, Give slumber to my eyelids, Until I find a place for thee, A place, O Lord, for thee." Our mighty God desires a home Where all His own may come.<p>This verse was written according to Psalm 132. It describes how David felt about God’s house, the church. We should have the same feeling towards His church.<p>If we mean business with the Lord, we will consecrate ourselves for this glorious commission. Firstly, we must pray. Prayer fills us up with the Triune God. Prayer causes the Father to give us those we ask for, and enables the Lord to bring to earth what has been done in heaven. Prayer also energizes us to accomplish this great work. We must pray. Pray at set times and pray all the time. Pray individually and corporately with our companions. Pray in spirit and with the Word. Pray until the Lord increases the church with flocks of men for the building up of His habitation (Ezek. 36:37). Pray until the Lord makes Jerusalem, the builded church in spirit, a praise in the earth (Isa. 62:6-7).
