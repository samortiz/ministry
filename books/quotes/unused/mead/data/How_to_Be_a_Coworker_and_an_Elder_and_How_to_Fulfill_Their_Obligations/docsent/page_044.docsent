   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>J. Not Working Out Our Own Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we beware of the above six "nots," that is, if we are conformed to the death of Christ, walk and have our being strictly according to the mingled spirit, set our mind on the mingled spirit, magnify Christ by living Him through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, live, walk, work, and move with Christ, and let Christ make His home in our heart by our inner man being strengthened by the Father according to His glory with power through His Spirit unto the fullness, the expression, of the Triune God, then we can attain this last item, which is the working out of our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philippians 2:12 says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was young, I could not understand this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Martin Luther stressed that we are not saved by works but justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why is it that this verse in Philippians 2 says that we need to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Later I saw that although justification by faith and God's selection in eternity, stressed in the reformed theology, are right, they are just partial truths.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible tells us that although we have received salvation, we still have to live it out practically.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we live out our salvation, that is the working out of our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have received God's organic salvation, but when we observe the attitude of the husbands toward the wives and the response of the wives to the husbands, we see that what is being lived out is not salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that we do not work out our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, we should be in fear and trembling to work out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fear is the inward motive; trembling is the outward attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should be in fear within and trembling without, lest we do not work out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Philippians 2:13 Paul went on to say, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This God is the Triune God, the very God who is Christ and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is this God who operates in us so that both our willing within and our working without may be according to His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This enables us to live out God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To live out God's salvation in this way requires us to have the previously mentioned items.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we beware of the six aforementioned items, the result is that we will be in fear and trembling to live out the organic salvation which we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that the items mentioned in this chapter will become the practical living in the homes of our brothers and sisters and the practical living in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The work which we do for the Lord must produce this kind of result.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If our work does not produce this kind of result, it will not be satisfactory to God or to man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we were baptized, we entered into the Lord's death and were buried.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have died with Christ, and now it is no longer we who live.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the attitude which we should have in our living so that we may work out God's salvation.</S>
