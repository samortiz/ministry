During this time we have not seen such openness to the Lord in the heart of men, nor have we seen such a desire for the gospel
The brothers who care for the students on the various campuses have found out that no matter where they go, people's hearts are open
They may read books, periodicals, and pamphlets related to the Bible, but they pay great attention to expositions of the Bible
There is an unprecedented need for the gospel, for Bible interpretation, and for the truth, because people everywhere have an open heart
Since the end of World War II until the present, for thirty-nine years, Christianity has been in a poor condition
It is now easy for the whole world to know what transpires in a given place within a short time; nothing can be hidden
The convenience in communication makes it easy to know what is being published in Christianity without much effort
We can boldly say that in the last thirty-nine years few Christian publications with spiritual weight were published in the world
Many believers want to read and understand the Bible, and the young people in particular want to study books on Bible exposition
The Western missionaries had the concept that they were going to preach the gospel and teach the Chinese people
In 1937 there was a burden in the work to take the rich truths among us to the brothers and sisters in the various sects and denominations
In addition, there are about one thousand two hundred Life-study messages, and every message has approximately ten pages
The goal of the life-study trainings is to release the mystery and truth in the Bible from the perspective of life
If we read some verses and carefully study the footnotes for those verses, that chapter of the Bible will be opened to us
My intention is also to help believers by explaining difficult portions that have been encountered by Bible readers for years
When a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, the 'death' it experiences operates on the shell of the grain
When water is added to the soil, the shell of the grain decays, but while the shell is decaying, the life within the grain begins to operate
The Lord Jesus was the grain of wheat, and the shell of the grain was His flesh in which the divine life was concealed
When the grain falls into the ground, on one hand, it is put to death, but on the other hand, it is made alive
We have seen the need among God's children; therefore, we should rise up and distribute the food in our storehouse
We still need to lift up our eyes to see that many households are starving and that there is famine everywhere
We should be able to say, 'In John 17:17 the Lord Jesus said, 'Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth'
If the brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei practice speaking the truth to people every day, there will be a result
If we will do this, the city of Taipei will be permeated with the gospel in one year, and many will be saved and brought to the church
We do not need to hold a Bible in our hand in order to speak the truth, and we do not need to look as if we are spiritual
We all need to speak the truth, cut straight the word of the truth, and open the Bible to people in a clear way
By the Lord's grace we can say that on all five continents the Lord's recovery is strong and rich in the truth
All the messages are printed in the books of the Elders' Training for the brothers and sisters to read and learn
Paul said that the elders who take the lead well should be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching
It is regrettable that we are satisfied if the elders in the churches are only able to manage business affairs
She should be able to teach her children at home, whether the subject is mathematics, geography, or natural sciences
In this modern age a good mother must receive higher education; otherwise, her children will not receive help with their homework
A competent mother should be able to teach mathematics, geography, English, Chinese literature, and even how to use the computer
The prophets in the Old Testament may have had disciples, but in the New Testament the apostles did not have disciples
The elders in the churches need to enter into the truth and be good mothers who teach the saints in the local churches
Every church will be a 'scholarly family,' and the brothers and sisters will spontaneously pursue the truth and progress in the truth
Whether we are taking a short trip or a long trip on the road, even in the train, we can speak with those around us concerning the truth
With such an atmosphere, one thousand saints should be willing to go out to preach the gospel and speak the truth
If we preach the gospel and teach the truth, our speaking will cause the Lord's word to spread on the island of Taiwan
If the person we are speaking to thinks that our words are reasonable, he will repeat what we say to other people
In this way, our speaking will spread from one person to ten persons, and from ten persons to a hundred persons
When we first came to Taiwan, we preached the gospel in one accord, and our whole heart was to preach the gospel
We divided the city of Taipei into several districts, and the saints went to every street and put gospel tracts in every mailbox
We also printed gospel banners, such as, 'God so loved the world,' 'Jesus is Lord,' and 'Jesus came to the world to save sinners'
One Saturday evening we baptized about four hundred people in three halls in Taipei and then baptized another three hundred the next morning
By preaching the gospel in this way, our number reached fifty thousand in six to seven years; this was a hundredfold increase
In the first seven years our number increased from five hundred to fifty thousand, but since then our number has not increased
If there are fifteen thousand saints in Taiwan who endeavor in the gospel, what would be our rate of increase?
We may be touched when we read a spiritual publication, but that feeling will last for only a few days, and then it will vanish
As long as we read the Life-studies and the footnotes of the Recovery Version, our mind will be opened to understand the Bible
Almost all the difficult portions in the Bible are resolved in the footnotes of the Recovery Version, and the answers are definite
The first category of reference books were related to the original text, and the second category were Bible expositions
All the saints, and especially the young people, should be encouraged to read the Recovery Version and the Life-studies of the New Testament
If we read six messages a week, we will read at least three hundred messages in a year and one thousand two hundred messages in four years
We can read through the Recovery Version of the New Testament and all the messages in the Life-study of the New Testament in four years
The college graduates who will join the fulltime training for two years will read two Lifestudy messages in four hours daily in the training
When we go out to speak the truth, we will be knowledgeable and able to clearly and logically present the truth
It is good to be able to use the Greek reference books, especially the lexicons, dictionaries, and word studies
The fourth chapter is 'Being Fervent for the Gospel by Preaching in the Homes and by Spreading through Migration' and is about the gospel
These four chapters are according to the comprehensive outlines that we used in the trainings held during the first seven years in Taiwan
As a result, we will bear some responsibility in the home meetings and group meetings to shepherd and teach the saints
Even though there was not much increase in the last years in Taiwan, the churches continued steadily, and we have an asset
By the Lord's mercy we held two trainings annually for eleven years and completed the life-study of the entire New Testament
The environment, the level of education, the convenience of transportation, and the prosperity in Taiwan are unprecedented
He has enabled us to maintain a good relationship with the different levels of the government these thirty-five years
They can share the blessing of the gospel and salvation and also the blessing of the truth and the divine life
According to Romans 6:3-5, we are baptized into the death of Christ, and when we come out of the water, we enter into His resurrection
Traditional meetings in Christianity follow certain procedures but we need to be delivered from rigidly following procedures in our meetings
The saints who did not give a testimony should not consider themselves superior and criticize the saints who testify
At present there are about 5000 saints who participate in the church life in Taipei and 3500 of these saints attend the meetings regularly
If we continue to increase in this way, in the tenth year everyone in the city of Taipei will be saved and will be our brother or sister
We need to study our situation to see if there are mistakes in the way that we carry out the work for the Lord's testimony
We have over five hundred churches on all five continents, but the churches do not have large numbers of saints
After the churches have finished their census and have organized their information cards we will know the actual number of saints in Taiwan
The saints who participate in the church life in Taipei are our 'land' that needs to be cultivated, but we have not cultivated our farmland
A meeting of the church should be a gathering of the saints with their riches that are released with a strong, rich spirit
If he has the sense in his spirit to read the verses first, he should read them; otherwise, he does not need to
Suppose everything in a meeting is focused on life: the prayers are for life, and the burden of the message is also on life
The hymns in the Chinese hymnal are classified into twenty-nine main categories and three hundred forty-five subcategories
There are one thousand eighty hymns in the English hymnal, but we regularly use less than three hundred hymns in the meetings
According to our custom, when we call a hymn, we ask the sister at the piano to play the tune once before the saints sing the entire hymn
If she waits for a brother to ask her to play the tune once and then plays the tune, the meeting will be deadened
The saints who are experienced in playing the piano can play a hymn fast or slow; they can also play it in a higher key or in a lower key
It would be wonderful for a young brother in junior high school to be led by the Spirit to release a concluding prayer after the message
In the local churches, we did not follow this old custom of calling our gatherings 'worship'; instead, we called our gatherings 'meetings'
Now most Chinese Christians, whether in China or overseas, have dropped the term worship and instead use the term meeting
According to the type in the Old Testament and the revelation in the New Testament, whenever we meet, we should bring Christ
Concerning worship to God, John 4:24 says, 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness'
She said, 'Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship'
In order to attend a feast, the children of Israel could not be empty-handed; they had to bring offerings with them
Let us exhibit Christ, / Let us exhibit Christ; / We'll bring His surplus to the church / And thus exhibit Christ'
On the one hand we must be in the Spirit to say that Jesus is Lord and on the other hand when we say that Jesus is Lord we are in the Spirit
Even though we may not be in the Spirit when we come to the meeting, as soon as we exercise to say, 'Jesus is Lord,' we are in the Spirit
We preach the gospel, speak the truth, and come together to live the normal church life as those who live Christ
The countenance or expression of a person who preaches the gospel should not change; otherwise, he cannot preach the gospel
When he sees a relative or a person who has a doctorate degree in the audience, he becomes timid and cannot speak to them
There are about 120,000 college students, 50,000 high school students, and 50,000 junior high school students in Taipei
Rescue the perishing' is concerning our need to preach the gospel, and 'You've fallen into sins' is about the sinner's need to be saved
We used the first four days of the Chinese Lunar New Year and had one session in the morning and another session in the evening
There are several gospel hymns that we sang often in northern China, for example, Hymns, 1044, 'Are you ready God to meet'?
Another hymn we sang often is 309: 'What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought / Since Jesus came into my heart'!
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
Luke 24:47 says, 'That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem'
The presence of opinions and disputes in the church is proof that the church has lost the burden of the gospel
Whenever a believer draws near to the Lord, he has the sense that he owes people the gospel, that he is a debtor of the gospel
We not only need to receive a commission from the Lord, but we also need to take care of the inner feeling of responsibility
If we are thin-skinned, we need to pray in order to be saved from our shyness and bashfulness when we want to preach the gospel
Suppose a student, who has so much homework that he needs to study during the day and at night, receives a burden to preach the gospel
They need to study diligently, but when they go to preach the gospel, they need to pray and be saved from their studies
In order to preach the gospel, we also need to be soaked with the Word of God through prayer and fellowship with the Lord
Before John Sung preached the gospel, he spent half a day to pray on his knees and immerse himself in the message
On the day of Pentecost Peter, who was a fisherman from Galilee, stood up and spoke in Jerusalem, the capital of the Jewish nation
We need to teach people to call on the name of the Lord, because the Lord's name is all-powerful, and it is in this name that we are saved
In conclusion, in order to have the power to preach the gospel, we need to pray, enter into the Lord's word, and be released
Acts 2 and 5 show clearly that the early believers first opened their homes for meetings , and then preached the gospel from house to house
After Cornelius was instructed by an angel to send for Peter, he invited his relatives and intimate friends to his home
We do not need to invite them all at one time, but we can invite three to five people at a time in a consistent way
The saints, who have a burden, should invite their relatives and friends for a 'gospel dinner' at least once a week
If we are all willing to endeavor to lead one person to salvation every year, there will be ten thousand saints by next year
Initially the church in Jerusalem had at least ten thousand believers, but they were all concentrated in Jerusalem
If we preach the gospel, we will receive a reward; if we do not preach the gospel, we will not receive a reward
The Lord knows whenever a sinner repents, because the Bible says that there is 'joy in heaven over one sinner repenting'
If every one of the seven thousand saints in this meeting leads one person to salvation, by next year there will be fourteen thousand saints
According to statistics, the population of Taipei and its suburbs is 3,000,000, and there is a floating population of around 800,000
There are around 50,000 saints on the name list of the church in Taipei, and about 5,000 saints meet regularly
The older saints, the middle-aged saints, and even the younger saints need to consider how they can lead one person to salvation in a year
If we are able to do this, we will have a twofold increase in one year and a thousandfold increase in ten years
We will be able to gospelize Taiwan in ten years, and Taiwan will be a gospel nation that is filled with the gospel
When the sisters buy groceries, they can give gospel tracts to the cashier and to other women who are buying groceries
In 1939 in Tsinan, Shantung Province, there was an official who held a prominent position at the Provincial Bureau of Construction
Because the brother was very burdened to preach the gospel to this official, he and his wife prayed for the official
The official threw away the gospel tracts he received, but he could not do this for three hundred and sixty-five days
In order to preach the gospel, we can have gospel marches, post gospel banners, distribute gospel tracts, and speak in every place
After the saints open their homes, they do not need to hold a big gospel meeting or to invite many people to hear the gospel
All the saints in the church in Taipei and in the Lord's recovery need to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel
In addition to the regular church meetings, we should open our homes to preach the gospel at least one evening a week
After listening to this word, we should all rise up and take action before God by opening our homes for the gospel
The saints who receive this word and are willing to open their homes can invite people over at least once every three weeks
The refreshments we prepare make it easy for people to open their hearts so that the gospel can enter into them
We may not know how to preach the first time and we may still lack experience the second time but as we continue to practice we will learn
The leading brothers need to let the saints preach the gospel, especially the saints who do not know how to preach the gospel
When we open our homes, we should also preach the gospel to the children, because almost every household has children
We need to lead our children to salvation, and we also need to gain the children of our relatives and neighbors
Even though the parents of some of the children may not be in our meetings, they may like to have their children join the children's meeting
After eight to ten years these children will be seeds for the spread of the gospel in junior high and high school and even in college
It would be good to have three hundred fulltimers who are between the ages of twentyfive and forty to preach the gospel on various campuses
In addition, the church in Taipei has information cards for thirteen to fifteen thousand saints, but only five thousand come to the meetings
We can restore them to the church life by fellowshipping with them, visiting them, and inviting them to our homes for meals
Even though five thousand saints attend the meetings in Taipei, there are only three to four thousand saints in any given meeting
The saints in a group should decide whether to meet once a week or once every two weeks for mutual fellowship and mutual visitation
We need to organize the information cards so that we will know who is in the church life and who is not attending the meetings
The saints in a group meeting should pray for the dormant ones who are assigned to them and consider how to fellowship with them
Even though we may not be able to recover every saint initially, we can gradually recover at least one or two thousand saints
If everyone functions in the ways that we have fellowshipped, the whole church will be mobilized to gain people
In conclusion, we need to be aggressive to preach the gospel in our homes, to children, to students, and to those with whom we work
We also need to lead the brothers and sisters to focus on knowing the truth, growing in life, and living Christ
The saints should also take part in the church life so that there will be a testimony of a golden lampstand in every locality
All the churches in the Lord's recovery will see this model and know how to spread and propagate in order to gain people
It seems as if the world has become smaller, because what happens in one place can quickly spread to other places
We must build up a model in Taiwan, because the condition in other places is not as favorable as the condition here
We need to grasp this golden opportunity to participate in the move for the spread of the gospel through the propagation and increase
