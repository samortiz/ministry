   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CIRCUMCISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PUT OFF OUR FLESH What is the significance of circumcision?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Firstly, it is to put off our flesh Col 2:11, 13a; Deut 10:16; Jer 4:4a; Acts 7:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians today talk about the overcoming of sin, but that is not the basic dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The basic dealing is to put off the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The flesh does include the sinful flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, in the Bible, the flesh includes much more than this, for it also includes our natural strength, ability, power, and talents.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, the flesh includes our natural man, the ego, the "I."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, to put off the flesh means to put off the very "I"; it means to terminate the self.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many years ago I was seeking for the overcoming of sin, but I was only partially successful until I saw that my need was not to overcome sin but to terminate myself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I began to see that once I was terminated everything would be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why Paul said that he who has died is free from sin Rom 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we try to overcome sin, the more we are involved with and troubled by it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The best way to overcome sin is to be dead and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then sin will have nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the basic dealing in the Bible is not to overcome sin but to terminate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the book of Genesis contains nearly all the seeds of the biblical truths, it does not contain the seed of the overcoming of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The real dealing with sin is not to overcome it but to get rid of ourselves, to circumcise ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once we have been circumcised and have ourselves terminated, we shall have no problem with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are still trying to overcome sin, it means that you are still living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you terminate yourself, you will be through with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, it is not a matter of dealing with sin or of trying to overcome it; it is a matter of terminating ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the negative significance of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>TO BRING US INTO RESURRECTION The positive significance of circumcision is to bring us into resurrection Col 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Circumcision was always performed on the eighth day 17:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In figure, the number eight signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that we cannot have circumcision without resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Circumcision must be in resurrection, and it will always usher us into resurrection, just as death ushers people into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, we have been crucified with Christ and have been buried with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, this crucifixion and burial will usher us into His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we have been terminated and ushered into resurrection, we become a new person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are still we, but we are now another person because we have another life, nature, and constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are people in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only by being in resurrection are we able to fulfill God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our natural strength, we can do nothing to please God or to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our self and our natural strength must be cut off in circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then in resurrection we shall become another person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>EQUAL TO BAPTISM Circumcision in the Old Testament is the equivalent of baptism in the New Testament Col 2:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both baptism and circumcision have the same purpose to terminate our natural being and bring us into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why are we baptized after believing in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because we realize that our old man has been crucified with Him and that we must be buried so that we may be one with Him in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, Abraham's circumcision has the same significance as our baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In both circumcision and baptism the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although Abraham was justified in Genesis 15, he was circumcised in Genesis 17.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As circumcision was the sign of Abraham's being justified, so baptism is the mark of our being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How can we prove that we have been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By living a life of baptism, a life of one who has been crucified, buried, and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we live such a life, everyone will be able to see upon us the mark of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>CORRESPONDING TO THE CHANGING OF HUMAN NAMES Circumcision corresponds to the changing of human names 17:5-6, 15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we have seen, to change the name is to change the person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When Abraham's name was changed, his person was changed also.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was especially true of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Jacob's name was changed to Israel, his person was changed 32:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This change of name can only be accomplished through circumcision, through having ourselves terminated and ushered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we are no longer a natural person but a resurrected person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Being terminated and ushered into resurrection is the real changing of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, circumcision corresponds to the changing of names.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now we can understand why the changing of names and circumcision are both revealed in the same chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These two things are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The changing of names and circumcision both mean to terminate our old being and to bring us into resurrection so that we may be another person.</S>
