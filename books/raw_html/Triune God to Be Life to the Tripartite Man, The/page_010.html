<P CLASS=HBODY>Grace in its highest definition is<br>God in the Son to be enjoyed by us;<br>It is not only something done or giv'n,<br>But God Himself, our portion glorious.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>God is incarnate in the flesh that we<br>Him may receive, experience ourself;<br>This is the grace which we receive of God,<br>Which comes thru Christ and which is Christ Himself.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Paul the Apostle counted all as dung,<br>'Twas only God in Christ he counted grace;<br>'Tis by this grace&#151;the Lord experienced&#151;<br>That he surpassed the others in the race.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>It is this grace&#151;Christ as our inward strength&#151;<br>Which with His all-sufficiency doth fill;<br>It is this grace which in our spirit is,<br>There energizing, working out God's will.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>This grace, which is the living Christ Himself,<br>Is what we need and must experience;<br>Lord, may we know this grace and by it live,<br>Thyself increasingly as grace to sense.</P><P>John 1 is a marvelous chapter because in it God as the Word (v. 1) coming in incarnation is combined with grace and reality (v. 14) to be our life (v. 4). Then verse 16 says, "For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace." All these verses indicate that God's incarnation was to bring Himself into us, that is, to dispense Himself into us, as our life. Grace and reality are God Himself. God came to be incarnated that man may receive Him as grace and reality, both of which are God Himself to be man's life as man's eternal portion. God as life is our eternal portion. Nothing is more valuable than God as life to us to be our eternal portion. As human beings, the most valuable thing to us is our human life. Clothing, a house, or a car are not as important as our life. If our human life is gone, we are finished. Life is everything. In the same way, God is our portion to be our life. This is the top blessing.</P>
