   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>M. Taking Care of the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>as the Lampstands in His Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 1:11-13 shows that Christ as the Son of Man is taking care of the churches as the lampstands in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the High Priest He is dressing the churches as the lampstands to cherish them, to make them happy, bright, and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is also caring for the churches with His divinity as the energy motivated by His love signified by the golden girdle on His breast.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>N. Coming Back in His Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ will come back as the Son of Man Matt 10:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He will destroy the whole earth as the flood did in Noah's days and as the fire and brimstone did at Lot's time Matt 24:37-39; Luke 17:26-30 and take away His believers who are watching and ready for His coming secretly Matt 24:40-44; Luke 12:40; 21:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His coming back has two parts: one part is the secret part, and the other is the open part.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The watchful ones, the ready ones, will see Him as the morning star and be taken by Him in the early part of His secret coming back Rev 2:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Later, He will openly come back to the earth as the sun of righteousness Mal 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today as the Son of Man He is expecting to find His believers in faith Luke 18:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Son of Man comes back, He will reap His harvest openly Rev 14:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He also will send His angels to collect out of His kingdom all the tares and cast them into the lake of fire Matt 13:41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of the false believers, the tares, damage God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They will be cast into the lake of fire when Christ comes back in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ as the Son of Man will return in the glory of His Father with His angels in His kingdom Matt 16:27-28; 25:31; Mark 8:38b; Luke 9:26b .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He will be ashamed of the people who were ashamed of Him and His words in this adulterous and sinful generation Mark 8:38a; Luke 9:26a .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When He comes back openly, He will be like the lightning coming forth from the east and shining to the west Matt 24:27; Luke 17:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lightning may be considered as being concealed in a cloud, waiting for an opportunity to flash forth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a similar way, Christ will be clothed with a cloud Rev 10:1 in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear, like a flash of lightning striking the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This implies also that the Lord is like electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He will appear in heaven on the clouds with power and great glory to be seen by all the mourning tribes of the earth Matt 24:30; 26:64b; Mark 13:26; 14:62b; Luke 21:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time they will see and receive Christ, and the whole family of Israel will be saved.</S>
