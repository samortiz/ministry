   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST MINISTERED AND THE CHURCH PRODUCED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Christ is ministered and the church is produced, they two become the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ministered Christ with the church produced out of Him becomes the corporate Christ 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church itself is the fullness of Christ, the expression of Christ Eph 1:23 ; whereas the corporate Christ, that is, the individual Christ with the church as His Body, is the fullness of God, the expression of God Eph 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First the church is the fullness of Christ, then Christ and the church become the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is manifested in such a corporate Christ who is the new man Eph 2:15; 4:22-24; Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This new man has Christ as his Head and the church as his Body, as a universal man for God s expression and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has been dispensing Himself throughout all the generations, and the ultimate issue will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Jerusalem will be just the fullness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even as the church today is the fullness of Christ, so in the same principle, the New Jerusalem will be the fullness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Looking at the New Jerusalem, you can see that God is expressed in His fullness to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is the Triune God expressed in full in His dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That will be the fulfillment of Ephesians 1:10.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the fullness of times God will head up all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today God only heads up the church in Christ on a smaller scale.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But when the new heaven and the new earth come, God will head up the entire universe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That will be the total expression of God through His dispensing of Himself into His chosen people throughout all the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You all need to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You need a vision that will change your concepts and your view and revolutionize your entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then you will hate the ethical things such as improving your behavior and character.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then you will aspire for the divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You will aspire for the divine dispensing of the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine glory to be increased in your being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the Christian life, and this is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the life that God is after.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wants a group of people redeemed and regenerated and living by the dispensing God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to live by the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Day after day we all must be under this dispensing.</S>
