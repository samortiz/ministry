Because Paul was one with God, he answered the questions in such a way that the Corinthians would be helped to be one with Him in every circumstance, condition, and situation. We know this by the fact that in answering certain questions Paul followed the principle of not initiating anything or changing anything. He made it very clear to the Corinthians that they should not initiate any action or change their status in any way.</p><p>If we change our status or initiate any action, this is an indication that we are not one with God and that we do not want to be one with Him. If we like to be one with God and are actually one with Him, we shall not initiate any change, especially change related to married life. On the contrary, our attitude will be, &ldquo;If God wants me to marry, let Him initiate it and work it out. If God does not want me to marry, surely He will grant me the gift I need to remain unmarried.&rdquo; This gift will produce a willingness, even a desire, to remain unmarried; it also will supply the ability to remain single. However, no one should make such a decision on his own. It must be God who takes the initiative and who grants us both the desire and the gift to remain unmarried. Paul was not married. However, he did not make this decision on his own. Rather, it was initiated by God, and God gave Paul the necessary desire and ability. This was the gift he received from the Lord. To repeat, whether we should marry or not, we should not initiate anything. We must leave this matter to the Lord.</p><p>In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul makes it very clear to the Corinthians that they should not change their status or initiate anything. In verse 12 he says, &ldquo;If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to dwell with him, let him not leave her.&rdquo; In verse 13 Paul says the same thing to a believing wife: &ldquo;And a wife who has an unbelieving husband and he consents to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.&rdquo; In verses 17 through 24 we see that we should remain in the status of our calling. In verse 17 Paul strongly charges us to remain in the state of marriage in which God has called us: &ldquo;Only as the Lord has allotted to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk.&rdquo; In verse 20 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Each one, in the calling in which he was called, in this let him remain.&rdquo; Then in verse 24 he concludes, &ldquo;Each one, brothers, in what state he was called, in this let him remain with God.&rdquo; This indicates that the believers must be one with God and have God with them in their situation, no matter what it may be. These examples indicate that Paul was absolutely one with God and wanted the Corinthian believers to be one with Him and not to initiate any change or action.</p><p>The Corinthian believers, however, were very different from Paul. Instead of being absolutely one with the Lord, they exercised their wisdom and philosophy. They philosophized about everything, including marriage. Some thought that it was better not to get married, whereas others strongly preferred married life. The way the Corinthians thought and spoke about marriage indicated that among them there was a great deal of human initiative. Therefore, in answering their questions, Paul indicates strongly that in the matter of marriage we should not initiate anything.</p><p>In this chapter we see that Paul&rsquo;s spirit was absolutely one with God. Paul was not willing to change anything or to initiate anything. This was the reason he could tell the Corinthians not to change their status as far as marriage was concerned. Those who were married when called by the Lord should remain married. This principle applies even to marriage with an unbeliever. The married believer should not initiate any change. On the contrary, the entire matter should be left with God. Whether the unbelieving party remains or leaves, the believing one should take the situation from the Lord. Everything depends on God and on the situations, circumstances, and conditions arranged by Him.</p><p>A believer who is absolute in the same way Paul was should be able to say, &ldquo;I do not have any problem with the situation or circumstances related to my married life. If my unbelieving spouse remains with me, I praise the Lord. If my spouse prefers to leave, I also take this from the Lord. In either case, I do not have any problems, and I do not fight with the Lord or struggle against Him. I realize that everything depends on God. I do not want to initiate anything.&rdquo; This is the attitude of a person who is both absolutely for God and one with Him. This is a person who does not initiate anything or try to change anything.</p><p>Paul even applies this principle to those who were slaves when they were called by the Lord. &ldquo;Were you a slave when called? Let it not concern you; but, if even you are able to become free, use it rather&rdquo; (v. 21). This word indicates that a slave should not seek to change his status. Instead, he should use his status as a slave to glorify God, that is, to remain in it with God for God&rsquo;s glory. Even if he is able to become free, he should remain in his slavery. He should not try to change anything. However, should God arrange circumstances which thrust him out of the condition of slavery, he should not fight against such a change and insist on remaining as a slave. Since God has arranged for a change, he should accept it. In either case, his attitude should be that he is one with God.</p><p>It is important to see this principle of being absolutely one with the Lord in all circumstances, situations, and conditions. If we are mindful of this principle as we read 1 Corinthians 7, we shall see that Paul is utterly one with the Lord and that in his instructions and answers he spontaneously and unconsciously expresses such an absolute spirit. Because Paul had this kind of spirit, he could answer the Corinthians&rsquo; questions in a clear and absolute way, in a way that would help them also to become one with God in their situation.</p><p>Paul&rsquo;s answers are very different from those given by marriage counselors. The advice given by marriage counselors reveals that they are independent of God and even rebellious against Him. In their instructions, advice, and answers they are altogether apart from God. Paul, on the contrary, was absolutely under God, for God, and one with God.</p><h2 class="head1">ACCEPTING OUR CIRCUMSTANCES</h2><p>Another very important point revealed in this chapter is that those who love the Lord, who are for Him, and who are one with Him must be willing to accept any kind of circumstance or situation. For example, if a brother&rsquo;s unbelieving wife desires to remain with him, he should accept this situation. But if she decides to leave, he should also accept this circumstance.</p><p>It is very important for us to see that God is always in our circumstances. We may say that the circumstances are actually God coming to us in disguise. Apparently we are in a particular circumstance; actually that circumstance is God coming to us and God with us. In verse 24 Paul says, &ldquo;Each one, brothers, in what state he was called, in this let him remain with God.&rdquo; Notice the words &ldquo;with God.&rdquo; They indicate that when we take our circumstances we take God. Both within the circumstances and behind them, God is present.</p><p>Once again we see that Paul had an excellent spirit, a spirit which was submissive, content, and satisfied. Paul did not have any complaints. In his spirit he was very submissive and content with his situation. No matter how he was treated, he did not complain. To him, every situation was of the Lord, and he would not initiate anything to change it. Paul could say, &ldquo;To me, everything works for good. This is the reason I don&rsquo;t want to change anything. I know that when I take my circumstances, I take my God. In every situation is my God, the One whom I love and the One to whom I belong absolutely.&rdquo; What an excellent spirit is displayed in this attitude!</p><p>In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul&rsquo;s spirit is expressed in the way he deals with the questions asked by the Corinthian believers. When we read this chapter, we need to sense Paul&rsquo;s spirit and even touch his spirit.</p><p>The way we answer others or respond to a situation always indicates the kind of spirit we have. Suppose a brother is very happy in the morning. When his wife calls him for breakfast, he says, &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; His response reveals his spirit. But suppose his spirit is heavy when his wife calls him. He may respond in a very different way, in a way which indicates that he is not happy. His reaction may indicate that he is unhappy with his wife and that he has a problem with the Lord. The principle here is that our answers and responses always express our spirit.</p><p>I appreciate 1 Corinthians 7 not primarily for all the answers it gives, but because this chapter conveys the spirit of a person who loves the Lord, who cares for the Lord&rsquo;s interests on earth, who is absolutely for the Lord and one with the Lord, and who in every respect is obedient, submissive, and satisfied with God and the circumstances arranged by Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_122.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_124.html">Next</a> </body></html>
