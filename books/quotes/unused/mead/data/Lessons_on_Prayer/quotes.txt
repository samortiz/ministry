[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE MEANING OF PRAYER MATCHING PRAYER AND THE READING OF THE WORD
[4]  Psalm 119:147-148 says, "I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.
[5]  He matches his seeking for the Word of God with his calling, that is, his prayer, before God.
[6]  May we look at an illustration confirming this matter.
[7]  In Ephesians 5, from verse 18 through verse 20, immediately after it says we should be filled with the Spirit, it tells us that we should speak to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with our heart to the Lord, and give thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord to God.
[8]  Again, in Colossians 3:16 and 17, after it says we should let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, it goes on to tell us that we should sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with grace unto God and in all things give thanks to God in the name of the Lord.
[9]  Now we may come to the first lesson of prayer the meaning of prayer.
[10]  A real prayer is also man breathing in God just as he breathes in air.
[11]  While you are thus breathing in God, spontaneously you are obtaining God, just as when you breathe in air you receive air.
[12]  Consequently, not only is God obtained by you and becomes your enjoyment, but also your whole being surrenders to God, turns unto God, and is wholly gained by God.
[13]  If you do not pray for a week or, even worse, a month, then you will be quite far from God.
[14]  And it is not enough to pray for only two or three minutes; you must pray again and again until you have actually breathed God and are actually obtained by God, and God by you.
[15]  Brothers and sisters, if you have really learned the lesson of prayer, whether you can find a house is actually secondary; the primary thing you should be concerned about is whether you have obtained more of God and whether you have been gained more by God through such a prayer.
[16]  PRAYER IS MAN COOPERATING AND CO-WORKING WITH GOD, ALLOWING GOD TO EXPRESS HIMSELF AND HIS DESIRE THROUGH MAN, AND THUS ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE
[17]  If a brother or sister has really learned the secret of prayer covered in the preceding two points, spontaneously there will be the following result: such a praying one will certainly cooperate with God, work together with God, and allow God to express Himself and His desire from within him and through him, ultimately accomplishing God's purpose.
[18]  This is according to Romans 8:26 and 27, which tell us that we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Holy Spirit intercedes in us according to God's purpose.
[19]  When I was sick, I thought, did I not pray to God asking him to heal me?
[20]  Ezekiel 36:37 says, "Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock."
[21]  Jeremiah 29:10-14 says, "For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.
[22]  For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
[23]  And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive."
[24]  If you search through all the experiences of prayer, you will discover that every such experience that can be counted as prayer before God is never initiated by man according to himself, but by the Holy Spirit within man.
[25]  Unless our prayers are initiated by God from within us, you and I can never have a prayer before God that is acceptable to Him, or prayer that touches His intent and even touches His throne.
[26]  Prayer is not only God passing through us, but every time we prayed an effective prayer which touched God as well as His throne, we also felt that in such prayer we were walking in God, and that even the words of our prayer were spoken in God.
[27]  While we pray, on the one hand, it is God passing through our being, and on the other hand, it is also we, our being, passing through God.
[28]  Or would you pray feeling your child is so lovely that you wonder what you would do if he were to die; and therefore, shed tears, earnestly and mournfully begging God to heal him.
[29]  But there are some who have learned the lesson and have received guidance so that when they pray for the healing of their child, they can also say before God, "O God, this is not for my sake but for Your sake; this is not my business but Your business.
[30]  Every proper prayer is also man speaking forth the intention of God.
[31]  Yes, it is you who are speaking, but it is God Who is expressing His heart's intent.
[32]  For example, you may pray, "O God, forgive me of my sins."
[33]  Therefore, when you pray for the salvation of your relatives and friends, if your prayer is proper, you ought to believe that in the universe God has the intention to save that particular relative or friend of yours.
[34]  Hence, when we go before God to pray, we should not immediately pray according to our own ideas, for this kind of prayer is usually initiated by ourselves and not by God.
[35]  For this reason, many times when people requested us to pray for them we could not accept their request because we know that proper prayers before God must not be according to our own decision, but according to the burden which we receive from God when we contact Him and touch Him.
[36]  PRAYER IS THE DISCHARGING OF OUR BURDEN BEFORE GOD
[37]  In a proper prayer you should always feel very much burdened at the beginning but very light at the end. If at the beginning of your prayer you are indifferent and at the end you are still indifferent; if you are neither burdened nor light; if it seems to make no difference whether you pray or not; then you know your prayer is not up to the standard.
[38]  A prayer that matches the standard must be one in which you first draw near to God.
[39]  While you draw near, an intention enters into you which becomes your burden, making you feel the need to go before God to pour out your heart and discharge your burden.
[40]  In the beginning it is God who initiates, in the process you are but one who cooperates with God, and ultimately it is for the glory of God.
[41]  We know that in whatever we do, the results always depend on the kind of person we are.
[42]  You may do the same thing someone else does, but when you do it, it turns out another way.
[43]  He may pray many prayers, but they are of little value before God, and he still cannot be counted as one who works with God, cooperates with Him, prays to Him, and fulfills His will.
[44]  MUST BE ONE WHO LIVES IN GOD ALWAYS HAVING FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM
[45]  It is not enough that a Christian live before God; he must also learn to live in God.
[46]  In today's Christianity we often hear people say that we should live before God and have a fearful heart before Him.
[47]  Of course, these teachings are very good; however, please remember that in the New Testament age it is not enough for man just to live before God; it is also necessary that he live in God.
[48]  If you would be willing to deal thoroughly with sins, separate yourself completely from the world, seek simplicity before the Lord, allow the Spirit of the Lord to purify you, and permit the cross to slay in you everything that is condemned by the Lord, then you will immediately see that the spirit of prayer inside you is quickened.
[49]  A man of prayer is also one who abides in God, waiting wholeheartedly before Him.
[50]  When you come to pray, you should not hastily open your mouth to express your ideas and to utter your feelings.
[51]  Rather, you need to stop and put aside your thinking and feeling, so that your whole being will be waiting before God.
[52]  MUST BE ONE WHO PUTS EVERYTHING OF HIMSELF ASIDE, ESPECIALLY HIS ABILITY AND OPINIONS
[53]  One who learns to pray must learn the strict lesson of putting himself aside and halting his being.
[54]  I would like to tell the children of God that there cannot be a single instance in which you meet God in fellowship that He does not demand anything from you.
[55]  If God has a demand, but you would not satisfy Him by paying the price of meeting that demand, then it would be very hard to maintain a free, flowing fellowship between you and Him, and you would not be able to live in the Spirit of prayer.
[56]  MUST BE ONE WHOSE LIVING CORRESPONDS TO HIS PRAYER
[57]  As a man of prayer, your living must be consistent, or must correspond, to what you pray.
[58]  If you are one who abides in God, lives in Him, and allows Him to have standing in you, then God in you issues forth a function which is faith.
[59]  In whatever we do, we need the life that corresponds to the accomplishment of that thing.
[60]  This life within us has a characteristic that makes us desire to pray, an ability that enables us to pray, and a demand that requires us to live in God.
[61]  Whenever the fellowship between you and God is interrupted, this life in you is in a half-dead state; consequently, you dislike praying and you are almost unable to pray.
[62]  This prayer life within us, because it is the life of God, is separated from everything that is unbecoming to God.
[63]  This life, therefore, requires you to be separated from the world, and demands that you put aside anything that is outside God.
[64]  If you want to be a man of prayer who can pray, is willing to pray, and who prays properly, you must agree with the demand of the life in you by putting aside whatever it wants you to put aside.
[65]  Since the life of prayer within us is also a life that hates sins, one who wishes to learn how to pray must also thoroughly deal with sins.
[66]  If you are even slightly defiled by sins, or love the world a little, immediately there is the consciousness within that you do not correspond to the characteristic of this life.
[67]  After you have confessed all your sins thoroughly, the distance is gone, and when you open your mouth to pray, you will definitely be able to touch God.
[68]  If you allow your sins to remain and you pray without dealing with them, there will surely be a distance between you and God, and your conscience will definitely condemn you.
[69]  You must confess your sin or you cannot pray, and you will always feel that there is a distance between you and God.
[70]  But if you regularly go before God to pray and to deal with sins according to the inner sense of life, eventually you will be free from your sins, your inner being will be quickened, and you will love to pray and will be able to pray, for the life of prayer is a life that hates sins.
[71]  If you learn to live in God, respond to His demand of holiness, follow the sense of His condemnation, and deal with any darkness, you will discover that the life of prayer in you is healthy and normal, and the law of prayer operates in you continually.
[72]  Some have heard the teaching concerning the exercise of the spirit, but since, in reality, they do not practice it much, their spirit is still weak.
[73]  Such a person especially has difficulty exercising his spirit in prayer.
[74]  Just as when I lay on the bed for six months my legs became the weakest parts of my whole being, when one does not exercise his spirit it becomes the weakest part of his whole being.
[75]  Due to lack of exercise many brothers' and sisters' spirits have become extremely weak and flat, so that even when you encourage them to pray, their spirits cannot rise up.
[76]  Therefore, we not only need to exercise our spirit at prayer time, but whenever something happens in our daily life we must return to our spirit, exercise our spirit concerning the matter, and then use the consciousness in our spirit to discern the situation.
[77]  For example, if your mind is defiled, when your spirit passes through the mind to come forth, the defilement of your mind becomes the defilement of your spirit.
[78]  If you do not have regular dealings before the Lord, your spirit cannot be fresh.
[79]  A spirit that is not fresh is invariably depressed and is definitely unable to pray.
[80]  Even if by the exercise of your will you force yourself to utter some words, or you use your mind to think of something to say, it is still futile.
[81]  Therefore, whether you can pray and how much you can pray depend upon whether your spirit is depressed or buoyant.
[82]  However, if you bear five things with you while you pray, you cannot pray well, because the things, being too many and too heavy, have caused your spirit to become completely worn out.
[83]  One cannot pray if his spirit has no rest and is always in turmoil.
[84]  CHAPTER SIX THE MIND OF PRAYER I. THE POSITION OF THE MIND
[85]  One who knows how to pray can usually quietly rest his mind.
[86]  X. THE MIND INTERPRETING THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE SPIRIT
[87]  Once there is consciousness in the spirit, it is necessary for the mind to interpret it.
[88]  Therefore, in order that the mind might be able to interpret it, it is necessary that one pay attention to the foregoing eight items: 1 to be renewed, 2 sober, 3 concentrating, 4 still, 5 minding the things of the spirit, 6 ruled by the spirit, 7 having a mind of the spirit, and 8 filling the mind with the elements of the spirit.
[89]  For example, in a prayer meeting, you have a burden to pray, yet you are not clear how to pray.
[90]  One who prays not only needs to have a proper spirit, but the various parts of his soul also need to be normal.
[91]  If we wish to learn to pray properly, we need to adjust our entire being.
[92]  We often say that someone has an abundance of emotions, but someone else does not have much emotion and therefore is cold, like a man of wood or stone.
[93]  The will is also a part of the soul.
[94]  V. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WILL AND THE SPIRIT
[95]  The function of the mind is to understand the consciousness in the spirit.
[96]  For example, your mind has understood that the sense within your spirit is directing you to pray.
[97]  CHAPTER NINE THE CONSCIENCE AND PRAYER I. THE POSITION OF THE CONSCIENCE
[98]  The conscience is the most evident part of the human spirit.
[99]  Whether you do something right or wrong; whether you are acceptable to God or not; whether your thinking is in darkness or in the light; whether your emotion is proper or improper; and whether your judgment is pleasing to God or not all these are under the supervision and inspection of the conscience.
[100]  If your thought is acceptable to God, the conscience will say yes; otherwise, it will say no. If your preference is pleasing to God, it will approve; if not, it will disapprove.
[101]  To be guiltless means that all wrongdoings which were condemned by the conscience have been dealt with before God and have been forgiven by Him.
[102]  If you have a conscience void of offense and have thoroughly dealt with everything before God, then when you argue with others there will be a clear, confirming response within you.
[103]  But suppose you did not obey the light you saw, or you did not answer a certain demand of God, or you were unwilling to forsake something as God required.
[104]  Suppose someone asks God for a number of proper things, but he does not seek God absolutely in his conscience and has no sense of condemnation.
[105]  But if your conscience is pure to the degree that you do not care for anything but God Himself, then in this circumstance you would not murmur to God.
[106]  Regardless how much we exercise ourselves to have a good and pure conscience, we still need to cleanse our conscience daily.
[107]  The more you are in the light, the more you will realize that you have offended a certain person, or that you are wrong in a certain matter.
[108]  The Bible clearly shows us that man was created with three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.
[109]  Many times when one comes to pray to God for a certain thing, he will ask God to show him His heart's desire, but he has his own desire also.
[110]  It says that God is greater than our heart, and if our heart condemns us, God will condemn us even more.
[111]  But if our heart does not condemn us, we have boldness toward God.
[112]  To pray to God, the heart needs to have boldness, which results from having no barrier between it and God.
[113]  Preceding and following this word, the Lord said, "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also No one can serve two masters you cannot serve God and mammon."
[114]  John 15:7 says, "If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you."
[115]  I. THE MEANING OF ABIDING IN THE LORD A. In the Lord
[116]  The experience of abiding in the Lord is based on the fact of being in the Lord.
[117]  If you are not in the Lord, there is no way for you to abide in the Lord.
[118]  As soon as we are saved God puts us into Christ.
[119]  The anointing of the ointment is the anointing spoken of in 1 John chapter two.
[120]  In the New Testament age, God comes to man as the Holy Spirit.
[121]  Within we have the inherent sinful nature, and without we live in a society which is full of sinful defilements.
[122]  If you live in the fellowship, you will understand what the Bible means when it says God guides us with His eyes.
[123]  " Colossians 3:16-17 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God; And in everything, whatever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him."
[124]  Ephesians 5:18b through 20 says, "But be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father."
[125]  For example, this morning I may feel the need to pray, but there is no word or explanation in me telling me what to pray for or how to pray.
[126]  The Lord's word to us comes in two stages.
[127]  Leviticus 16:18-19 says, "And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.
[128]  In Leviticus 16:12-13 it says, "And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil: And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not."
[129]  Although there are numerous aspects of the cross, with relation to prayer there are mainly two aspects.
[130]  When anyone offers a sacrifice at the altar, after it has been accepted by God and consumed by fire there are only two things in front of him.
[131]  A man may be able to pray a great deal before God, but he should not be over-confident that all his prayers are acceptable to God.
[132]  The more you are a praying one, the more you will feel that you are sinful, and realize the need for redemption.
[133]  At such a time you tell God, "O God, I can only come into your presence to pray under the blood of Your Son and with the blood of Your Son.
[134]  One who knows how to pray and can pray is always one who has been both redeemed under the blood and terminated on the cross.
[135]  Suppose you wish to pray concerning the gospel, your family, the giving of material things, or about the matter of marriage.
[136]  If you have not been terminated in a certain matter, yet you bring that matter into the presence of God in prayer, it is a great offense to God.
[137]  Revelation 8 clearly shows us two things: the prayers of the saints, and the Angel, that is, the Lord Jesus, bringing much incense.
[138]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN LIFE SUPPLY AND PRAYER I. THE SIGNIFICATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPE
[139]  We place this chapter after the chapter on "The Cross and Prayer" on the basis of the procedure in the tabernacle.
[140]  When the priest would go in to the incense altar to burn incense, he had to first pass through the offering altar.
[141]  The holy sacrifice and the showbread being placed before God show forth the fact that the priest's going before God to burn the incense, to pray, is related to life supply.
[142]  It is very hard to always maintain our life before the Lord in a trouble-free condition.
[143]  We must admit that there are not many praying ones in our midst, and a number of brothers and sisters have a problem in their prayer life.
[144]  In the previous two chapters we have covered the relationship between the cross and prayer and the relationship between life supply and prayer.
[145]  What you must have is an experience before the Lord, so that even though no one has ever taught you anything about the matter of fasting, you cannot help but fast and pray.
[146]  Take another example: I may preach the word in Matthew 5 which says, "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go away; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."
[147]  You feel that there is something in you shining and pressing you so that when you go home you cannot help but pray.
[148]  THE WORK OF THE LIGHT OF LIFE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE
[149]  It is a certainty that the most purified person is the one who can pray the most effectively.
[150]  THE WORK OF THE LIGHT OF LIFE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
[151]  Once you have the positive work of the illumination, learn to bring your whole being to a halt and pray before God according to that illumination.
[152]  The more you pray this way, the more you become dead, the emptier you are within, the less you touch reality, and the worse you feel within.
[153]  As we touch the work of the life illumination on the positive side and pray accordingly, at a certain time we will surely become very restful within.
[154]  One thing is certain: if in accordance with the positive work of the life illumination in you, you speak forth all the burden, leading, words, and utterance which you have felt, then you will surely be full of rest within.
[155]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE NECESSITY FOR PRAYER TO BE IN RESURRECTION I. THE INDICATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPE
[156]  Beginning with chapter thirteen, we have been dealing with the various aspects of prayer based on the Old Testament types.
[157]  Whenever the Bible speaks of man going before God to burn the incense, it invariably refers to man going before God to pray.
[158]  That which is not in harmony with God, that which is not of God, and that which cannot last eternally is completely terminated once it goes into death.
[159]  For example, you may pray for the church or for the work of God.
[160]  If you remain for a time somewhat quiet before the Lord, you will have an inner realization that there are so many natural and human elements in your prayer.
[161]  I have met a number of brothers and sisters who prayed boldly for their families, enterprises, and children.
[162]  The contents of their prayers were nothing but asking for blessings, longevity, and peace.
[163]  Moreover, they even had the scriptural basis, saying, "O God, You are rich in mercy, and You would never make us suffer.
[164]  When you go before God to pray, you intend to accuse him, but the Spirit will not allow you to do so.
[165]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN ASCENSION AND PRAYER I. THE ILLUSTRATION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
[166]  In the Old Testament typology, both the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies denote the heavens, or the heavenly realm.
[167]  The altar of offerings being in the outer court indicates that the cross is accomplished on the earth; whereas, the altar of incense being in the Holy Place indicates plainly that the standing of prayer must be in the heavenly realm.
[168]  Although we humans are on earth and seem to be praying on earth, every prayer that is acceptable to God should be uttered in the heavenly realm.
[169]  As the position of prayer is ascension, the authority of prayer is also ascension.
[170]  When you arrive at this place, you will know that there are certain things for which you cannot pray, because God does not allow you to do so.
[171]  If you have learned to pray by standing in the realm of ascension, you can even command poverty to leave you.
[172]  If you really wish to have some worthwhile prayers before God, you need to be able to give out some authoritative commands before God.
[173]  In this chapter we will look at the matter of the prayer of warfare.
[174]  If we have seen that the prayers of greatest worth are prayers in ascension, then we can easily understand that prayer is a warfare, and we will utter prayers of warfare.
[175]  A prayer such as that just referred to is a prayer on the throne, even a reigning prayer.
[176]  Whenever we have a grievance or anger, we fall from the heavens to the earth and immediately lose our position of ascension to pray.
[177]  Christians are very familiar with the matter of fasting in prayer, but unfortunately, many misunderstand its meaning and treat it as a common thing.
[178]  I am afraid that there are not many who really know what it means to fast and pray.
[179]  Thus, if we pray for a certain burden, and within our heart we still consider our future, our destiny, or our life, then we may pray, but we do not need to fast.
[180]  V. FASTING IS FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOD'S WILL AND FOR THE DEFEAT OF SATAN
[181]  Fifth, fasting is for God's will to be accomplished and for Satan to be defeated.
[182]  Perhaps you will ask, "When we fast and pray for the healing of our sickness, can we say that this is also for God's will to be accomplished and for Satan to be removed?"
[183]  You need to receive mercy, become enlightened, and be led to such an extent that even though your sickness may be so serious that there is no hope for recovery, you will still say to God, "O God, if You keep me on this earth, all my days henceforth shall be absolutely for You; if not, may You allow me to die quickly.
[184]  Brothers, this does not mean, therefore, that when you are sick and you fast and pray, God will necessarily heal you.
[185]  Since the meaning of fasting is so serious, I would advise you, brothers and sisters, not to fast lightly.
[186]  If you have never sensed that there is a great responsibility coming from God to you, it simply means that you have never indicated to God with a firm attitude that you want His will and want to stand on His side.
[187]  First, if a burden truly presses you to such an extent that you cannot help but fast, then remember this: never fast without praying.
[188]  Therefore, whenever you have a heavy burden that presses you to the extent that you cannot help but fast, you must do your best to pray.
[189]  If you come to the Lord with so many things to pray for, then you should not fast, because you have not reached the point where you can neither eat nor drink but can only pray before God.
[190]  Let us read several verses from the Gospel of John.
[191]  "And whatever you ask in My Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son" John 14:13 .
[192]  "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you" John 15:16 .
[193]  Having understood the meaning of being in the name of the Lord, it becomes clear that to pray in the name of the Lord means that you, the praying one, are in union with the Lord.
[194]  Brothers and sisters, when we have prayed, many times we were unable to say that we prayed in the name of the Lord, for we know that it was just our prayer; the Lord would not have prayed that way.
[195]  So, at the end we should have said, "O God, we are praying in our own name," for, in practice, it is we ourselves, not the Lord praying in us.
[196]  If you read those words in their context, you can see that the Lord Who lived on this earth has now become the Spirit living in you, and He is living Himself out from you.
[197]  THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRAYING IN THE LORD'S NAME AND DOING GOD'S WILL
[198]  In John chapters fourteen through sixteen the Lord Jesus clearly points out that prayers in the name of the Lord by those who live in the Lord are prayers that accomplish God's will.
[199]  When we first heard that we needed to pray in the name of the Lord, we thought we could pray for anything in the Lord's name.
[200]  Although you may have many desires when you are in yourself, once you turn and get into the Lord's name, you will see that your desires become restricted and that there are many things for which you simply cannot ask.
