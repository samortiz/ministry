<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Christ Being Magnified<br>in Our Body</H2><P>Christ should also be magnified in our body (Phil. 1:20b). This should even affect the way that we dress and comb our hair. Does the way that we dress and comb our hair magnify Christ? Christ needs to be magnified, exalted, and extolled in us in every way and in every circumstance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Christ Being Formed in Us</H2><P>Christ has to be formed in us (Gal. 4:19). This means that we have to let Christ occupy every part of our being. Christ should occupy our mind, our thinking, our consideration. Christ should occupy our emotion, our love, our hatred, our happiness, our sorrow. Christ has to occupy our will. He should be in all the decisions that we make. He also needs to fully occupy our conscience in everything. For Christ to occupy us in this way means that He is making His home in us. In Ephesians Paul prayed that Christ might make His home in our hearts (3:17). Then in Galatians 4:19 he expressed his desire for Christ to be formed in us. To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ grown in us in full.</P><P>Christ is invading our mind, our emotion, our will, and our conscience. He is invading our entire inward being. Eventually, through our soul, He will even invade our body, saturating us with Himself and dispensing Himself into our entire being. His invading is His saturating, and His saturating is His dispensing. Eventually, we will be fully and thoroughly permeated with Him. He will be formed in us, and we will be conformed to His image.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Growing Up into Christ, the Head,<br>in All Things with the Growth of God</H2><P>We also need to grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things with the growth of God (Eph. 4:15b; Col. 2:19b). Maybe the way that we cut or style our hair is still outside of Christ. This means that we have to grow. When we grow further, we will grow up into Christ in the way that we cut our hair.</P><P>To grow we need some element added into us. We need to grow up into Christ in all things with the growth of God, which is the increase of God, the addition of God. This is revealed in Colossians 2:19. Christ is spreading Himself into us. When He is spreading in us, He grows in us, and He is adding Himself into us. With this element of God, we grow. This is not a matter of following ethical teachings in an outward way. This is altogether something organic. We have the organic God within us as our life. He is growing in us, adding Himself to us, and invading us.</P><P>In order to grow up into Christ in everything, we must be very careful and considerate. Since we realize that we have Christ living in us as our life, we have to walk carefully with much consideration. Before some of us were married, we lived in whatever way we pleased. But now that we are married, we have to be careful. We need to walk carefully with much consideration of the one with whom we live. We have to apply this principle to Christ. Before we were saved, we may have been wild or quick. Now that we have Christ living in us, we should not be that wild or that quick.</P><P>Because we fail so much by not living Christ, I am so thankful that Christ is our washing, cleansing fountain (Zech. 13:1). This is why we need to confess our sins throughout the day to enjoy the cleansing of the Lord's blood. We should confess that we are still in the flesh, still in the old creation, and still in the natural man. Because we are so rough, we do not consider Christ much of the time. We do not walk carefully and slowly, with much consideration of Christ. We must learn to walk and have our being in Christ slowly, carefully, and with much consideration. We need to live Christ in such a way. We need to live carefully all the time, with much consideration of Christ.</P>
