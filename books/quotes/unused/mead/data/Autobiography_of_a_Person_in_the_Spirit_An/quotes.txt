[1]  CONTENTS Ministry Through the Cross A Person in the Spirit Captured by Christ Reduced to the Spirit Mirror, Camera, and Vessel Ambassadors and Co-workers The Temple and the Virgin Lovers of the Church and Tasters of Christ The Spirit of Paul Christ as Grace
[2]  He states that the central thought of the Scriptures is that God intends to work Himself in Christ through the Spirit into us, that God and we, we and God, might be really one in life, in nature, and in the Spirit.
[3]  For us to enjoy and experience Christ in a rich way we must be persons in the spirit as symbolized by ten aspects in 2 Corinthians captives, letters, mirrors, vessels, ambassadors, co-workers, a temple, a virgin, lovers of the church, and tasters of Christ.
[4]  CHAPTER ONE MINISTRY THROUGH THE CROSS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:4-6, 8-9, 12, 19-22
[5]  In 2 Corinthians, Paul shows us that if we are going to have a ministry of Christ, we have to experience Christ by the working of the cross 1:9; 4:10-12 , and the working of the cross is for us to experience the anointing, the sealing, and the pledge of the Holy Spirit 1:21-22 .
[6]  Second Corinthians gives us a pattern, an example, of how the killing of the cross works, how Christ is wrought into our being, and how we become the expression of Christ.
[7]  Second Corinthians speaks concerning the ministry, which is constituted with, and produced and formed by, the experiences of the riches of Christ through sufferings, consuming pressures, and the killing work of the cross.
[8]  The Body needs some brothers and sisters who have been thoroughly wrought by God and with God that they may have something of Christ, not merely in their mentality as knowledge to teach others, but as the very riches of Christ in their spirit and in their entire inward being to pass on to others.
[9]  THE ANOINTING, THE SEALING, AND THE PLEDGE OF THE SPIRIT
[10]  When the cross has been working through you, this working brings in resurrection.
[11]  If we are going to minister something of Christ to others, we have to experience Christ by the working of the cross, and the working of the cross is for the anointing, the sealing, and the pledge of the Spirit.
[12]  We are now in Christ and Christ is our portion, but we experience Christ by the working of the cross.
[13]  If you get into the spirit of Paul's Epistles to the Corinthians, you can see that at the time Paul wrote these two books he had the history of the children of Israel as a background.
[14]  In 2 Corinthians 1, Paul told us that he and his co-workers were "excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living" v. 8 . They had the sentence of death in themselves that they should not trust in themselves but in the very God who raises the dead v. 9 . We need to be impressed with these words in 1:9 "we should not have confidence in ourselves, but in God." Through the redemption of Christ, the very God, who is in the heavens, has come into us, into our spirit Col 1:27; 2 Tim 4:22 . Thank the Lord that He is now in our spirit, calling us to forget about the soulish things and turn to our spirit to meet Him.
[15]  We should no longer trust in our self, in our soul, but in God who is in our spirit.
[16]  THE OUTWARD MAN DECAYING, YET THE INWARD MAN BEING RENEWED
[17]  Verse 16 of chapter four says, "Wherefore we do not lose heart, but if indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day."
[18]  Because Paul lived in the spirit, he learned the lesson of how to deal with people's thoughts.
[19]  They are captured by those who war, who fight the battle, not according to the flesh but with the weapons which are powerful to God v. 4 . When you have the ministry, when you are a person really living, walking in the spirit, you are not fighting the battle according to the flesh, but you are equipped, qualified, to do a work to capture the thoughts of people, to bring all their thoughts into captivity to the obedience of Christ.
[20]  CHAPTER THREE CAPTURED BY CHRIST Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 2:14-16; 3:3-6
[21]  As we have seen in the past two chapters, 2 Corinthians gives us a full portrait of a person living in the presence of God, that is, in the Holy of Holies.
[22]  After Paul tells us that he is a captive in chapter two, he goes on to tell us that we have to be letters of Christ in 3:3.
[23]  In 3:3 Paul said that "you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God."
[24]  When you are really subdued by Christ, the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of Christ within you, will have the chance, the free way, to write something of Christ gradually into every part of your being.
[25]  We have seen that the Apostle Paul shows us in 2 Corinthians how he was a person absolutely in the spirit.
[26]  In 1:18-20 Paul says, "But God is faithful, that our word toward you is not yes and no; for the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you through us, through me and Sylvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but in Him is yes.
[27]  CHAPTER FIVE MIRROR, CAMERA, AND VESSEL Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:13-18; 4:3-11; 16-18
[28]  We have seen that a person who is living in the presence of the Lord, that is, in the spirit, in the Holy of Holies, is likened to a captive in a celebrating procession and to a letter.
[29]  If we mean business with the Lord and desire to follow Him in the spirit, we have to be captives and we have to be inscribed with the Spirit of the living God to be the letters of Christ to express Him.
[30]  These verses in 2 Corinthians 3 should not merely be a doctrine to us.
[31]  The real deliverance from traditional religion is not something merely outward, but it is something in the spirit.
[32]  As vessels we contain a wonderful treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything.
[33]  When you open yourself to the Lord, when your mind with the thoughts is open, and you have a right spirit in a right heart, the divine light brings Christ into your spirit and impresses Christ into your spirit.
[34]  CHAPTER SIX AMBASSADORS AND CO-WORKERS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:4, 5, 9, 10, 13-17, 20; 6:1, 4-10
[35]  In this chapter we want to see the fifth and sixth aspects of a person who is living in the presence of the Lord, in the Holy of Holies.
[36]  Since I realize that I have Christ as the immortal life within me, I have to endeavor with an ambition to please Him all the time 2 Cor 5:9 .
[37]  If you are going to be an ambassador of Christ, there must be one day in this whole universe in which you make a decision, calling the heavens and the earth to be the witnesses, that you are now absolutely for Christ, that you only have one ambition to please Christ.
[38]  Because the love of Christ constrained him, Paul was a person that lived to the Lord v. 15 . Another item which equips us to be the ambassadors of Christ is the constraining love of Christ.
[39]  The sixth aspect of a person who lives in the spirit, in the Holy of Holies, is that he is a co-worker of God 6:1 .
[40]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE TEMPLE AND THE VIRGIN Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 6:14-18; 7:1; 11:2-4 THE TEMPLE OF GOD
[41]  In 2 Corinthians 6:14 7:1 we see the seventh aspect of a person living in the Spirit the temple of God.
[42]  Paul told the Corinthians in 11:2, "I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ."
[43]  As a captive, you need to be captured; as a letter, you need to be written; as a mirror, you need to be unveiled; as a vessel, you need to be broken; as an ambassador, you need to be wholly for His interest and under His authority; as a co-worker, you need to be bound; as a temple, you need to be separated to perfect holiness in the fear of God; and as a virgin, you need to be so simple.
[44]  CHAPTER EIGHT LOVERS OF THE CHURCH AND TASTERS OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:1; 11:28-29; 12:11-19, 7-10
[45]  Thus far, we have seen eight aspects of people who live and walk in the spirit in the presence of the Lord: captives, letters, mirrors, vessels, ambassadors, co-workers, the temple, and the virgin.
[46]  If we have really been captured by the Lord, are under His writing in the spirit, are unveiled mirrors reflecting Him all the time, are broken vessels to express Him, mean business with Him to represent Him on this earth as His ambassadors, are bound with Him as one to be His co-workers, are the temple for His rest, and are the virgins to Him for His satisfaction, we are surely lovers of the church because the Body of Christ, the church, is what Christ is longing for.
[47]  The Apostle Paul was a pattern of a lover of the church.
[48]  The church in Corinth spoke evil concerning Paul behind his back.
[49]  The tenth aspect of a person living in the spirit is that he is a taster of Christ.
[50]  If we are going to love the church, we have to experience Christ.
[51]  In 2 Corinthians there is the aspect of loving the church and even more the aspect of tasting Christ, enjoying Christ, experiencing Christ.
[52]  CHAPTER NINE THE SPIRIT OF PAUL Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 6:11-13; 7:2-4, 12-16; 10:1-2, 7-12; 11:1, 5-31; 12:1, 11-19
[53]  If we read the verses above carefully again and again, we can see what kind of spirit this man, the Apostle Paul, had.
[54]  The verses in the Scripture reading also show us that Paul was a man with a frank spirit.
[55]  CHAPTER TEN CHRIST AS GRACE Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:12; 4:15; 6:1; 8:1, 2, 9; 9:8, 14, 15; 12:9; 13:14; John 1:14, 16-17; I Cor.
[56]  Grace in its highest definition is God in the Son to be enjoyed by us; It is not only something done or giv'n, But God Himself, our portion glorious.
[57]  God is incarnate in the flesh that we Him may receive, experience ourself; This is the grace which we receive of God, Which comes thru Christ and which is Christ Himself.
[58]  We must have a bird's-eye view of the entire book of 2 Corinthians so that we can see the way to enjoy Christ.
[59]  Some would answer that to enjoy Christ we need to pray-read the Word and exercise the spirit.
[60]  Regardless of how much we try to exercise our spirit, if we are not captives of Christ, it will be hard for us to enjoy much of Christ as grace.
[61]  The love of God is the source, since God is the origin; the grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, with their divine virtues.
[62]  God to us is the love, Christ to us is the grace, and the Spirit to us is the fellowship, the transmission, transmitting all that Christ is as grace, with all that God is as love in Him, into us for our enjoyment.
