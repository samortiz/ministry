   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN TO KNOW THE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF HIS SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we saw that the power of resurrection requires death as its base.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If there is no death, it is impossible for the power of resurrection to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The four Gospels reveal this principle very clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Gospels are a record of a Person who always lived under the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus was crucified not only at the end of the Gospels but throughout His life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As He was growing up and as He came into the ministry commissioned by God, He was continually under the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, He lived a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Based on the death of the cross, His resurrection power was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CHOOSING TO SET ASIDE THE HUMAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus had two kinds of life, the divine life and the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He had the divine life for the purpose of expressing God and the human life for the purpose of having God expressed in man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order for Him to accomplish such a marvelous expression, He had to continually set aside His human life so that His divine life could be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus made the decision regarding the setting aside of His human life, not by His divine life, but by His human life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This decision had to be made by the Lord Jesus as a man, not as God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God had already decided that the human life should be set aside for the expression of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, it was necessary for the man to agree with God's decision.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thank the Lord that, as a man, the Lord Jesus decided of His own free will to set aside His human life so that His divine life might be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This matter of the will brings us back to Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God created man, He created him with a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first man, Adam, was defeated; however, the second man, Jesus, came, also with a free will, and He was victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The entire universe, including Satan, the angels, and the demons, was watching to see what the Lord Jesus would do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everything depended upon the decision He made with His will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Would He choose the will of God or something else?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's will was that Christ use His free will to choose God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hallelujah, He did choose God's will!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Gethsemane the Lord prayed, "Not as I will, but as You will" Matt 26:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To deny our will and to choose God's will means that we die on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ's commission was to express God in man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this, He needed two kinds of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to express God, He needed the divine life; and in order to express God in man, He needed the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a man desiring to express God in His humanity, the first thing He had to do was to put His human life aside.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This decision was not easy to make.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let me use once again the illustration of married life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some sisters are eager to get married.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But every sister who gets married must be prepared to be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The reason there are so many separations and divorces is that the wives are not willing to be killed by their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, they want to be emancipated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From the very beginning of her marriage, a sister must determine to take her husband's will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In every culture a bride wears a head covering during the wedding ceremony.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates the bride's submission to the will of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For a wife to submit to her husband's will requires that she put herself to death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Lord Jesus was about to begin His ministry, He was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Baptism signifies burial, termination.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being buried in baptism was the inauguration of the Lord's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>During the three and a half years of His ministry, the Lord lived as a crucified and buried person, living always under death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This experience of death was the base for the manifestation of the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where death was, there was resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For the sisters, marriage also is a form of baptism, a kind of burial.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Forty years ago, I used to give a pleasant word at wedding meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But now if I am asked to say something, I tell the couple that marriage is an altar upon which they will be slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sisters, do not forget that to be married is to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you want to get married, you must be ready to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you realize this, you will have a happy married life, for your marriage will be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In marriage, God requires more of the wife than He does of the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God does not ask the man to be killed by his wife because in marriage the man represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God is the universal man, the universal husband.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In a marriage the husband represents God as the universal husband.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the wives are willing to be buried and to live a married life that is under the killing of the cross, the power of resurrection will be manifested, and all the troubles will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I can assure the sisters that Satan, the evil angels, and the demons will be terrified by their termination and burial and will not bother them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The reason you are bothered by so many things is that you are still so alive.</S>
