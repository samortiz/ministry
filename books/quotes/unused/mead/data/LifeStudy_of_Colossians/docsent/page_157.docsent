   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GENUINE GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a result of being rooted in Christ and absorbing His riches into us, we grow in Him, just as trees grow by absorbing nourishment from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order for a tree to grow, it must receive some substantial nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The nourishment in the soil becomes the substance by which a tree grows.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not many of today s Christians realize what genuine growth is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>True growth is not the result of acquiring more doctrinal knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the result of turning to the spirit, remaining in the spirit, and absorbing the nourishing element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only by assimilating this element can we grow spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more this rich element is added into our being, the more we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Colossians 2:19 says that by holding the Head the Body grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To grow with the growth of God is to grow by having God Himself added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This takes place only when we are rooted in Christ as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God Himself with His element and substance is the rich nourishment in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we remain rooted in our spirit, we absorb this element, and this causes us to grow with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We grow with the addition, the increase, of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is altogether a matter of the genuine experience of Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have seen that if we would walk in Christ, we must be planted and rooted in Christ, the divine Spirit in our spirit, and remain in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we find ourselves out of the spirit, we need to turn back to the spirit and stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By remaining in the spirit, we are rooted in Christ in a practical way and thereby absorb the rich nourishment into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As this nourishment flows into our inner being, it causes us to grow with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Growth takes place as God is added into us, for the rich nourishment in Christ is actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From our experience we know that as we are rooted in Christ, we grow and, spontaneously, we then walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BUILT UP INDIVIDUALLY AND CORPORATELY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Colossians 2:7 also speaks of being built up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we grow in Christ, we are being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Years ago, I considered the building up in 2:7 to mean the building up with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But this is not the meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, the meaning is that we ourselves need to become built up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, as a tree grows, it builds itself up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same is true of children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They become built up by growing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The building up of the Body depends upon the individual and personal building up of all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a particular member has not been built up, it will not be possible for him to be built up in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be built up in the Body we first must be built up in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we have become built-up members, we shall then be able to be built up with others in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the building up in 2:7 is not that of the Body corporately, but the building up of the members individually.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Ephesians 4:16, on the contrary, we have the building up of the Body in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is important to see that if we have not been built up individually, we shall not be able to be built up with others corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The building of the meeting hall in Anaheim illustrates this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The material used in the construction of the hall was first built up in itself; then it was used with other pieces of material to form the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Redwood, for example, was used in the exterior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But a tender sprout of a redwood tree could not be used for this, could it?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The redwood trees first had to grow and be built up in themselves by absorbing the riches from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only then could they become the proper building material.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The same is true of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to remain in our spirit absorbing the rich nourishment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we absorb this element, we shall grow, and by this growth we shall then be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then it will be possible for us to be built up with others in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we would walk in Christ, we need to absorb His riches by being rooted in Him and to be built up as individual members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to sink our roots into Christ deeper and deeper so that we may absorb more of His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we shall grow and be built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Having fulfilled these two conditions, we shall then be able to walk in Christ.</S>
