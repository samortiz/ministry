 <h2 class="head1">ENDEAVORING TO GO ALONG WITH THE LORD<br />
TO FULFILL 1 CORINTHIANS 14:26</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14:26 says that whenever we come together, each one has something of the Lord to share with the other attendants in the meeting for the building up of the church. We have to ask where such a reality is on this earth today. This verse needs to be fulfilled and it will be fulfilled. Fifty years ago in 1937, Brother Nee saw this matter, and his fellowship was published in the book <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> We did our best to find a way to practice this, but we did not get through. In 1948 Brother Nee gave a four month training in which he released a particular series of messages that are contained in the book <em>Church Affairs.</em> In this series of messages, he touched the truth of 1 Corinthians 14:26 again in a strong way. In 1984 I went back to Taiwan from the United States because I realized that we must have a new start. Taiwan was the source of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery outside of mainland China. After four years of study in Taipei, eventually I was led to this point&mdash;1 Corinthians 14:26. We must endeavor to do everything we can to go along with the Lord for the fulfillment of this verse. This has been unveiled to me, so I cannot remain merely in my teaching during the past twenty-five years. I must have a new start. I must do my best to lead and to guide the saints into this new stage.</p>
<p>Since 1 Corinthians 14:26 is a verse in the holy Word, it needs to be fulfilled. If we would not pick up this burden, the Lord will go to others, and this will delay Him. A small delay to Him, though, is inconsequential because to Him one thousand years are as one day. We will be the ones who will suffer loss. We will miss His mark, His smile to us today, and His reward. Brother Nee saw this matter and spoke it to the saints, but they did not find a way to practice it. Then he spoke it a second time, but soon after that he was arrested and put into prison where he died after twenty years. I believe that Brother Nee will surely be reckoned by the Lord as an overcomer, but if I am not faithful to carry out this vision, I feel that I will miss the mark, miss the reward, and receive a strong rebuke from the Lord. Brother Nee spoke this to me and I saw it, so I must do something. This is why I am so burdened.</p>
<p>Today is the day that the Lord is doing His work to fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26. By fulfilling this verse, He will be able to build up His Body organically and prepare His bride organically. The Lord&rsquo;s building work is organic, not organizational as in Christianity. We must have a change. Certain factories must change the machines that they use at certain intervals so that they can be up-to-date with the most recent technology. Otherwise, they will be behind. We must &ldquo;change our machines.&rdquo; I have pointed out in the past that no one can change the globe that we live on, but the means of transportation can be improved. Man has progressed from the mule wagon to the 747. We cannot change the truth, but we must change to the best and most scriptural way to carry out the truth. We must change. We are too old in our way. The old way from tradition should be put away. We came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but much of the tradition of Christianity followed us.</p>
<p>I am so burdened because I have seen a clear vision. I have the deep conviction that I have been commissioned by the Lord. If I do not release this burden for the fulfillment of 1 Corinthians 14:26, I am not faithful to the Lord. I have no choice before the Lord. The Devil hates this way because he knows it puts him into the corner by building up the Body of Christ and preparing the bride for the coming Christ. I have the confidence that deep in our spirit there is an echo to this fellowship. I have the full assurance that the Lord will raise up some faithful ones to fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26 to bring in the reality of the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
