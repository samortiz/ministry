   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO FIVE ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Rev 12:5, 10-11; 14:3-4, 14; 19:7-9; 21:2-3, 10-14, 22; 22:1-2, 14, 17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Revelation is a wonderful and all-inclusive book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the consummation of all the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nearly all the points and subjects in the Bible are consummated in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without it, there is no consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the beginning of Revelation, we see the local churches with Christ walking in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then at the end of this book, there is the holy city, New Jerusalem, God s habitation for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the beginning there are the churches, and at the end there is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The local churches and the New Jerusalem are two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The local churches will eventually issue in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all must see this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE KERNEL AND THE SHELL</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Between the local churches and the New Jerusalem there are many things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The things we are interested in depend upon what kind of Christian we are.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was young, I was with a group of Christians who were often in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They always talked about the beasts, the ten horns, the seven eyes, or sometimes the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven vials.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many times they taught me concerning the three and a half years, forty-two months, and twelve hundred and sixty days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their mathematics in this book were exact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a young man I had the desire to know all these things, and they did not disappoint me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, after I had learned these things, I became dead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It took the Lord much grace to make me alive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some may wonder why these things would deaden me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Are these not things that are in the book of Revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are these not scriptural matters?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yes they are.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when you eat peanuts, what part do you eat?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you pick up the peanut, break it, drop the kernel, and eat the shell?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Never.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But do not the shells belong to the peanut?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without the shells, the kernel could never grow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet no one would be so foolish as to drop the kernel and eat the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, among all Christians, everyone seems to be so foolish when coming to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We neglect the kernel, and choose the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We even use many ways to grind the shell into powder and make bread with the shell powder.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But even then it is not tasteful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I was forced to feed on these shells for over seven years, and thus became so dead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE RIGHT SET OF SEVENS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praise the Lord that in these last forty years, when I come to the book of Revelation, I forget about the beast, the ten horns, and the seven heads!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I was with that poor beast long enough.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In these past years I have begun to see the Christ in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In chapter one, He is the wonderful Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His head is white, His eyes are flaming, and His face is shining.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His robe covers His whole being, and His golden girdle is on His breast.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is caring so much for all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is what we must see in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This wonderful One is so much more precious than the ugly beast.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His seven eyes are more marvelous than the seven heads.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In these days I do not like to study the seven trumpets and the seven vials.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I would much rather deal with the seven lampstands, the seven Spirits, the seven stars, and the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many have chosen the wrong set of sevens.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They only know the seven trumpets, the seven vials, and the seven heads.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Praise the Lord for another set of sevens!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Seven lampstands, seven Spirits, seven stars, and seven churches!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I would never trade this set of sevens for the other.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are too many wonderful things in the book of Revelation for us to pay so much attention to the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A WONDERFUL WOMAN AND THE FIRSTFRUITS</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Revelation 12 we see a wonderful woman.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>She is clothed with the sun, and under her feet is the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Upon her head is a crown of twelve stars.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Is not this much better than the beast?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need the shell for the sake of the kernel, but we should always realize which is the most important.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Undoubtedly, this wonderful woman is part of the kernel, and the ugly beast is but a part of the empty shell.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then in Revelation 14 we read of 144,000 followers of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>And I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with Him an hundred forty and four thousand, having His Father s name written in their foreheads....These are they which were not defiled with woman; for they are virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb Rev 14:1, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Eventually these followers of the Lamb will be the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Who are they?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They are not a special kind of people.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They are just like you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They are the redeemed of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are not angels.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They will be the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At this time the Lamb is not on earth, but on mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the heavenly mountain where God is.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In typology, the firstfruits were brought into the temple to present to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God Himself enjoyed the freshness of the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When the harvest time comes, the harvest will not be brought into the temple, but to the air, which is between the heavenly temple and the earth Rev 14:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In any type of farming, there is the farm, the barn, and the farmer s home.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The barn is always between the farm and the home.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The farmer does not take the firstfruits into the barn, but into the home for his own enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then, later, the harvest is brought into the barn.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our Father s home is the temple on the heavenly mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Therefore, the firstfruits of His farm will not be brought into the barn in the air, but to the temple which is on mount Zion in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then the harvest will be brought into the barn.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is really wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I love to study the wonderful Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I love to study the seven local churches, the seven lampstands, the seven stars, and the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I also love this wonderful woman and this wonderful crop with the firstfruits and the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But as we read on we come to a horrible scene.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is the great Babylon, the great harlot, the mother of harlots.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>She is in Revelation 17 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We do not need to spend much time here.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We only need to know that she is fallen, and the Lord calls all His people to come out of her Rev 18:2, 4 .</S>
