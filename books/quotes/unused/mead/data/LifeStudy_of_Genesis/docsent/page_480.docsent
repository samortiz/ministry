   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE EIGHTY-FOUR BEING TRANSFORMED 7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall again devote our attention to the two pillars at the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that when Jacob was first at Bethel, he set up as a pillar the stone he had used for a pillow and called it the house of God 28:18, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have pointed out again and again that nearly everything in the book of Genesis is a seed that is developed in the following books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The full development of the seed of the pillar is in Revelation 3:12, where the Lord Jesus says, "He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Between Genesis and Revelation, there are many portions of the Word concerning the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each time the two pillars at the temple are mentioned we see more of the details regarding them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not every aspect of the pillars is found in any single portion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today's Christians have very little concern for God's building, which is for the accomplishment of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although most Christians neglect this, the Bible strongly emphasizes it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we would know the building, according to the biblical way, we must firstly see the pillar, for the pillar is a signboard of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we see what the pillar is and decide to become a pillar, then we are on the way of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The pillar is so crucial that the Bible mentions it over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because most Christians have no understanding of God's building, they do not pay attention to those portions of Scripture which mention the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But by the Lord's mercy we have been so deeply impressed with the pillar that we simply cannot get away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible has no wasted words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, whatever it reveals is meaningful and crucial for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because, at this end time, God is completing His building, we must carefully consider what the pillar is and how we can become a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would like now to stress three positive aspects and two negative aspects of the pillars covered in the last message.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The three positive aspects are the brass, the lily, and the pomegranates.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The pillars themselves were made of brass.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the top of the capital were the lilies and around the capital were the pomegranates.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I doubt that any human designer would ever have put these three things together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But how crucial and meaningful it all is to us!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brass signifies death under judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be under judgment, realizing that we are good for nothing but death and that we have been crucified Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, we all have been buried in baptism Rom 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, we are a people under the judgment of death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But after death comes resurrection, and the lily grows upon us in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The pomegranates surrounding the capital signify the expression of the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, in the pillars we see death, resurrection, and the expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Praise the Lord that many of us can testify that day by day we are the brass growing lilies and expressing pomegranates.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are you not such a person?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are not, then you are not qualified to be a pillar and you have nothing to do with God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The two negative aspects of the pillars are the checkerwork the network and the chainwork.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The checkerwork and chainwork signify the intermixed and complicated situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The checkerwork is a lattice composed of intersecting bars.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that, in our experience, we are daily being crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we undergo this, we are held by the chainwork.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many times we brothers are under the crossing out of our dear wives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although we may desire to escape this, we are held by the chains and cannot slip away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may be cut into pieces, but not one piece can escape.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sisters can all testify of the same thing in relation to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some in the church life say that they cannot bear the crossing out of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, the chainwork is also there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the church life we have both the checkerwork and the chainwork.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Praise the Lord for these two negative things, because the brass, the lily, and the pomegranates can only be connected by them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not long after I was saved, I learned that I had been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But I did not know how this crucifixion could practically be applied to me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is applied by the checkerwork, the network.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without the network and the chainwork, our co-crucifixion with Christ and His living instead of us would be mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may know the doctrine of being crucified with Christ and recite Galatians 2:20 over and over only to discover that this does not avail.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I did this again and again without success.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I repeated the words, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Later, I experienced the network and the chainwork in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It has been through these two negative things that the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ have been practically applied to my life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually, therefore, the three positive things and the two negative things become one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have the brass, the lily, and the pomegranates joined by the checkerwork and the chainwork.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All five are joined in the pillar.</S>
