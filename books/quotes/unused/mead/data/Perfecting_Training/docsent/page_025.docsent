   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A BODY, NOT AN ORGANIZATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The local church is not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No one is here exercising anything to organize.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The pastoring of many pastors is not the real feeding, but a kind of organizing just to get a proper link with people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We never do this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the local church there is no organizational linking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I go to you I must have a burden in life for you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I go to visit you for a kind of link, that is organization.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all have to see that what the Lord is going to recover is a Body, not a local organization.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the saints do not grow, what is the need to have a link?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The need is to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You need the real supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You need the real ministry of the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not a matter of pastoring to establish some links.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is a matter of growing and ministering a life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you have been an elder in the local churches for at least five years, you will realize that among your brothers and sisters some have come to a certain stage that you cannot do anything to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have prayed for them; you have done this for them and that for them, but now you can t do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why can t you do anything?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is because you do not have the skill of a surgeon to operate on the peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A surgeon may know how to cut on your leg or your nose, but he may have no way to deal with a particular part of your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He may have no way to touch it or even to reach it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Spiritually speaking, something is in your heart, and that is your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is there, and yet no one can touch it, and even no one can reach it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why I prayed at the beginning that only the Lord can solve our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I don t have the skill to touch our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I know the disease; I know the problems, but I don t have the skill to reach your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the very thing which holds us back from experiencing Christ and from being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So under this kind of situation, the more days you go on in the church life, the more you feel you are jobless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand you have nothing to do; on the other hand you are not useful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On another hand you have no interest in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And on yet another hand you may be thinking either to drop the church life or to stay home for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although you may not drop the church life and you may not stay home, you come to the meeting without any kind of meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Coming to the meeting becomes meaningless to you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was not like that ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ten years ago every meeting was meaningful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You might have missed your meal, but you would not have missed the meeting because it was so meaningful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You are jobless; you are not useful; everything in the church life has become meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because your peculiarity holds you back and eats you up from further experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank the Lord that in His mercy and grace through the church you have been edified, so it s hard for you to go back to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It may be a little bit easier for you to go back to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But although you would not go back to sin, and you would not go back to the world, to stay in the church life becomes tasteless to you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because your peculiarity eats you up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The eating by this germ holds you back from the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You and I need a desperate prayer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Don t pray for anything else just pray for your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Day and night, three times, ten times, even twenty times a day, pray for this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the germ in your heart that eats you up and holds you back.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many of the brothers are really good, but they have become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As leading brothers we don t know how to help them, and we have no way to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We really need the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You have to pray that the Lord would have mercy upon you, that you would have a clear vision of the stronghold within you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether you label it peculiarity or you label it the self, there is such a stronghold within you that all the time keeps you from Christ and from the building up of the Body.</S>
