[2]  53 And when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.
[3]  54 And He came into His own country and taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said, Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power?
[4]  After we have seen the unveiling of the Lord Himself and the unveiling of the mystery of the kingdom of God, we as His followers need to know the way to follow Him .How we thank Matthew for including in his doctrinal book not only a diagram of the kingdom, but also a map of the pathway so that we may enter into the kingdom.
[5]  1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,
[6]  2 And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, and because of this these works of power are operating through him.
[7]  14 And going forth, He saw a great crowd.
[8]  15 Now when evening fell, the disciples came to Him, saying, This place is deserted and the hour is already late.
[9]  22 And immediately He compelled the disciples to step into the boat and to go before Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.
[10]  23 1 Standing in the position of man 4:4 , the heavenly King, as the beloved Son of the Father 3:17 , needed to pray privately to His Father who was in the heavens, that He might be one with the Father and have the Father with Him in whatever He did on earth for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens.
[11]  1 Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
[12]  8 "This people honors Me with their lips, but their 1 heart stays far away from Me;
[13]  Outline The King's being rejected 12:1 27:66 The increase of rejection 13:53 16:12 Rejection by His countrymen 13:53-58 Rejection by the heathen tetrarch 14:1-13 The miracle of feeding five thousand 14:14-21 The miracle of walking on the sea 14:22-33 Healing by the fringe of the King's garment 14:34-36 The accusation by the traditional religionists 15:1-20 Crucial Points
[14]  From the end of chapter thirteen to the middle of chapter seventeen we have a clear map showing us how to walk on the pathway as we follow our beloved King into glory.
[15]  21 And Jesus went from there and withdrew into the parts of 1 Tyre and Sidon.
[16]  22 And behold, a 1 Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, 2 Lord, Son of David!
[17]  1 And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing Him asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven.
[18]  13 Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?
[19]  The Lord brought His disciples purposely to such a place with its clear atmosphere that their thought might be released from the effects of the religious surroundings in the holy city and holy temple and that He might reveal to them something new concerning Himself and the church, which are the pulse of His heavenly kingdom.
[20]  18 And I 1 also say to you that you are 2 Peter, and upon 3 this rock I will 4 build My 5 church, and the 6 gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.
[21]  19 I will give to you the 1 keys of the 2 kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you 3 bind on the earth shall 4 have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you 3 loose on the earth shall 4 have been loosed in the heavens.
[22]  21 From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised.
[23]  22 And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord!
[24]  24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him 1 deny 2 himself and take up his cross and follow Me.
[25]  25 For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever 1 loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.
[26]  Outline The King's being rejected 12:1 27:66 The increase of rejection 13:53 16:12 The faith of a Gentile woman 15:21-28 Healing for the glorification of God 15:29-31 The miracle of feeding four thousand 15:32-39 Temptation by the fundamentalists and the modernists 16:1-12 The path of rejection 16:13 23:39 Before going to Judea 16:13 18:35 The revelation of Christ and the church 16:13-20 The first unveiling of the crucifixion and resurrection 16:21-27 Crucial Points
[27]  By this Matthew shows that what the Lord wants is not the washing of hands but the eating of Him, the taking in of Him as food.
[28]  16:28 Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man 1 coming in His kingdom.
[29]  17:1 And after six days Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up to a 1 high mountain privately.
[30]  2 And He was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light.
[31]  3 And behold, 1 Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with Him.
[32]  4 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make 1 three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.
[33]  8 And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw 1 no one except Jesus Himself alone.
[34]  9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.
[35]  14 And when they came to the crowd, a man came to Him, falling on his knees before Him and saying,
[36]  24 And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the 1 temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the 1 temple tax?
[37]  Outline The King's being rejected 12:1 27:66 The path of rejection 16:13 23:39 Before going to Judea 16:13 18:35 Transfiguration in the miniature of the kingdom 16:28 17:13 The casting out of an epileptic demon 17:14-21 The second unveiling of the crucifixion and resurrection 17:22-23 The application of the revelation and vision of Christ's sonship 17:24-27 Crucial Points
[38]  The Lord's transfiguration was a miniature of the kingdom 16:28 17:13 .
[39]  Not many Christians realize that Christ's transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom.
[40]  According to Matthew 17:1-2 with 16:28, His coming was His transfiguration, and His transfiguration was His glorification.
[41]  1 In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest 1 in the kingdom of the heavens?
[42]  2 And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst
[43]  3 And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
[44]  15 Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, 1 reprove him 2 between you and him alone.
[45]  21 Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?
[46]  28 But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a 1 hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe.
[47]  3 And some Pharisees came to Him, testing Him and saying, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?
[48]  4 And He answered and said, Have you not read that 1 He who created them from the beginning made them male and female,
[49]  16 And behold, someone came to Him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may 1 have eternal life?
[50]  17 And He said to him, Why do you ask Me concerning what is good?
[51]  In John, to have eternal life is to be saved by God's uncreated life that we may live by that life today and for eternity; but in Matthew, to have eternal life is to participate in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in this age by God's eternal life and to share in the kingdom's manifestation in the coming age, thereby enjoying God's eternal life in a fuller way.

[53]  Chapters eighteen, nineteen, and twenty are a distinct section of the Gospel of Matthew dealing with the relationships among the kingdom people.
[54]  27 Then Peter answered and said to Him, Behold, we have left all and followed You.
[55]  28 And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the restoration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
[56]  1 For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, who is a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.
[57]  17 And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately, and on the way He said to them,
[58]  22 But Jesus answered and said to them, You do not know what you are asking.
[59]  1 And when they 1 drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
[60]  2 Saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her; untie them and lead them to Me.
[61]  12 And Jesus entered into the temple and cast out all those who were selling and buying in the temple.
[62]  Outline The King's being rejected 12:1 27:66 The path of rejection 16:13 23:39 After arriving in Judea 19:1 20:16 The reward of the kingdom 19:27 20:16 On the way to Jerusalem 20:17 21:11 The third unveiling of the crucifixion and resurrection 20:17-19 The throne of the kingdom and the cup of the cross 20:20-28 The healing of the two blind men 20:29-34 A warm welcome to the meek King 21:1-11 In Jerusalem 21:12 23:39 Cleansing the temple 21:12-16 Lodging in Bethany 21:17 Cursing the nation of Israel 21:18-22 Crucial Points
[63]  In Matthew 19:27 20:16 we have the reward of the kingdom and the parable of the kingdom reward.
