   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Out from the Head, Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the Body Causes Its Growth</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After growing up into Christ, the Head, in all things, we will surely remain in the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then, out from the Head, Christ, all the Body will cause its growth Eph 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose that during the day we all live loosely, telling stories to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all need to realize that this kind of storytelling brings death to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the evening when the time of meeting comes, we all will come and sit down in a deadened condition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If everyone is dead, the meeting also will be a dead meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There will be no singing, praising, or giving of thanks, because all were killed during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But suppose there is no such storytelling and no gossiping, reasoning, or debating in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This situation will keep everyone in a living condition with praising and singing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then when we come to the meeting, the meeting will be uplifted, high, full of the Spirit, full of singing, and full of Amens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because all the attendants in the meeting are deadened, sometimes it is difficult for the speakers to begin the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The deadening atmosphere is in the meeting because the church has been deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet many do not have any consciousness of the deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They do not feel that they have done anything wrong, yet they have been so free to expose others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This might be the reason that we have been in one city meeting regularly week by week for ten years and yet have very little building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to hold to truth and allow no vanity to come out of our mouths Eph 4:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we will maintain a living atmosphere, and whenever we come together, we will be very living, organic, full of praises, full of thanks, and full of prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everyone will be able to pray and everyone will be able to open his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are living, when we open our mouth, our prayer also becomes living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if we are deadened, even though we may struggle to pray, "Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lord, You are so good," there is still nothing but deadening.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even our prayer is deadening.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of deadening affects the ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, the church is annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reality of the church is taken away by our looseness, carelessness, and vanity in different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, we do not have the growth, and without growth, building is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The building up of the Body of Christ should not be merely a term on our lips; it should be something carried out in our daily life that builds up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That is building up by growth, and that is to grow up for the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With the Growth of God</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Be assured that when we live in the way of holding to truth in love, God will always be added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Colossians 2:19 says that the Body "grows with the growth of God."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Himself God does not need to grow; He is altogether complete and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in us, He needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The measure of Christ in us is too short, and the quantity of Christ is too little.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need more Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need God to be increased within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We grow with this kind of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST By the Body's Growth</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The building up of the Body of Christ is by the Body's growth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all need to grow that the Body may be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we grow, the Body grows, and the Body grows for its building up.</S>
