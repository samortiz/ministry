   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SALVATION NOT BEING THROUGH BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we have to consider another question.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people say that a man cannot be saved without being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps those among us would not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But some who have been affected by the poison of Roman Catholic tradition may be full of this kind of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Recently, a few co-workers and I met a few western missionaries in Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They all paid much attention to this matter of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a certain missionary in Hong Kong who is very strong about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They certainly have their scriptural basis, which is Mark 16:16: "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some would argue that this means if a man has believed but has not been baptized, he is still not saved, because this verse clearly says that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here I would like to ask a question.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What does salvation mean here?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It says: "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But following this it says: "He who does not believe shall be condemned."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From this we see that the salvation here must not refer merely to deliverance from condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must be careful here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord says he who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The corresponding sentence should be that he who does not believe shall not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But it is so strange that it says he who does not believe is condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the salvation in the first clause must not refer to the not being condemned in the second clause.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to see that not only does salvation refer to a man's salvation before God, but it also refers to his salvation before men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before God, it is a question of condemnation or no condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before men, it is a question of being saved or not being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before God, all those who believe in the Lord Jesus are not condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He who does not believe is condemned already.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the word of John 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But one cannot say that he who believes and is baptized shall not be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can say that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but not that he who believes and is baptized shall not be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is because condemnation has to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Salvation here does not have to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Salvation has to do with man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is why the question of baptism comes in. To be condemned or not is a matter before God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That is why there is only the difference between believing and not believing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be saved or not is not before God; it is something for man to see.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That is why there is the difference between baptism and no baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we read the Bible, we have to take care of these distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will take John 3 again as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus said in verse 5: "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then in verses 6 and 8, when it mentions this matter again, it mentions only being born of the Spirit, without mentioning being born of water.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reason for this is that there are two sides to the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One side is spiritual, and the other side is earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Spiritually speaking, if a man is not born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But there is still the human side.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the human side, there is not only the need to be born of the Spirit, but the need to be born of water also.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is the Spirit like?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It says the wind blows where it wills.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can also say that the Spirit blows where it wills.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the original language, wind and spirit are the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Both are pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Spirit blows where He wills.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One does not know where He comes from or where He is going.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man cannot control the wind in the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When it comes, it simply comes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When it goes, it simply goes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many times, we only hear the sound of the wind, and know that it is here, or that it is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot control the wind in the sky, but we can control the water on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have no way to control the wind blowing on my face.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But I can determine whether I want to go into the water or not.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The wind blows where it wills, but the water goes where I will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I cannot order the Spirit in heaven to put me into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But I can manage to get myself into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I can have a part in the kingdom of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When I am baptized, no one can say that I do not belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is why the Lord said in Mark 16 that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
