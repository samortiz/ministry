   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Mind Being Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First our spirit becomes life and then our mind becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that the divine life has spread from within our spirit into our soul to saturate our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we need to tell the saints that our mind actually represents our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not too much to say that the mind here is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The mind here is the soul because it is the main part of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When our mind is really married to our spirit, set upon our spirit, relying upon our spirit to be one with our spirit, such a mind becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>DISPENSED INTO OUR BODY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 8:11 says that the Spirit of the very God who raised Christ Jesus from the dead gives life to our mortal body, our dying body, through the Spirit who indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word mortal in this verse implies not only the thought of death but also the thought of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A mortal body is a weakened body, a dying body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 7 calls our fallen body the body of this death v. 24 . Even such a weakened, dying, mortal body, a body of death, can be given life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus far, we can see that the divine life mentioned in Romans 8:2 is imparted, or dispensed, into our spirit in verse 10 and spreads into our mind in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then it is dispensed into our mortal body in verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the divine life is dispensed into all three parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A. Through God's Indwelling Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This dispensing of life into our mortal body is through the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the Spirit indwelling us, life cannot be dispensed from the center of our being to the circumference of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our spirit is our center and our body is our circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So the divine life first is dispensed into the center, and from the center it spreads to the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then our body is enlivened through the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. To Give Life to Our Mortal Body</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have covered this already, but when we give this message, we need to dwell upon this point.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Very few Christians realize that the divine life can even be dispensed into our body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should give the saints some illustrations of this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes after work in the evening, we are worn out and weakened and do not think we can attend the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we would exercise our spirit to pray and contact the Lord, this will allow the indwelling Spirit to move in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Spontaneously the divine life will be dispensed into our weakened body, and our weakened body will be vitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we will have the physical strength to go to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a proof that life can be dispensed into our weakened body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Watchman Nee practiced this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He had a very troublesome heart that was always weakening his body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many times while he was speaking, the trouble came.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He no doubt at that juncture exercised his spirit to let the indwelling Spirit vitalize, or enliven, his weakened body, so his body did not frustrate or delay his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He surely experienced the divine life being dispensed from his spirit into his weakened body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can also give testimonies of our own experiences in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our weakened, dying, or sick body can be vitalized by the divine life through the indwelling Spirit.</S>
