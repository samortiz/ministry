   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOW IS THE TIME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must cooperate with the Lord by saying, "Lord, now is the time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You must shame your enemy by building us up together."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This will defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have the full assurance that the Lord is going to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not afford Him the opportunity to do it, He will find others who will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Lord will get His building and shame His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 19 tells us clearly that the Lamb will come as the Bridegroom to take His Bride, who has made herself ready.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But without the building, where is the possibility of the Lord having such a Bride?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is it in the Catholic Church?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Is it in the denominations?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is it in the free groups, or in the scattered so-called spiritual ones?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Where is the Bride being prepared?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not care much for increase in numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Increase does not mean that much, but the building means everything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Lord's recovery, we are only for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I love the brothers in the churches in Texas.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you were to go visit them, you would see that they care for nothing but the building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a sense, they are a real army with an impact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They do not have extensive Bible knowledge, and they do not know very much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They only know one thing: to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And they are one, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all must realize that the real impact which puts the enemy to shame is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The building is the impact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all must pray, "Lord, I am through with so many things I appreciated in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want to leave all those things behind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only one goal is before me, and that is Your building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am not for anything that hinders, hurts, or damages Your building!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not care merely for our holiness and spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not mean that we should not pray, or that we should not take the Word into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What I mean is that everything we do must be for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Anything that distracts us from the building must be put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No matter how good or spiritual it seems to us, we must leave it if it is a frustration to God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we take this attitude, we will have the Lord's rich presence, and we will experience the anointing with life and peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then Satan will really be defeated and put under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as we are in the building, there is no need to fight against him; he is defeated already.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If, however, we are divided and scattered, Satan will get the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>EAT THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we must see some of the practical matters concerning the building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are really for God's building, the first thing we must do is eat the Lord in the Word all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I say this from my own experience, and it is confirmed by the experience of many others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To eat means to take something into you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not to learn about something, but to digest and assimilate food.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Day by day we must take the Lord Jesus into us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The best way to take the Lord in is to pray-read the Word or to pray Him in by calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not mean to pray in a way of asking the Lord to do something for you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord already knows all our needs and will care for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is hardly any need to remind Him of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But we must spend more and more time to pray Him in. Then, practically speaking, in all our daily life we must learn to apply Him in many areas.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Praise the Lord that He is such a real Person to us!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is not vain; He is real!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is not far away from us; He is within our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>So we must pray, "Lord Jesus, I take You in."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is a real Person, and He is so substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why Peter says, "As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the Word, that ye may grow unto salvation" 1 Pet 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What is the pure milk of the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is simply Jesus as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is in the Word, and He even is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then Paul says, "I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the growth" 1 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The real growth is Jesus added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul planted Jesus into the Corinthians, and Apollos watered with the living water, which is also Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then God gave the growth, which is the increase, the addition of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this way, Jesus is added into us bit by bit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is not a matter of knowledge, doctrine, power, ability, or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is a matter of Jesus Himself being added into us all the time.</S>
