   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE WALKING IN GOD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is an important subject.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many believers do not grow in their spiritual life because they do not know how to walk in God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They have many thoughts in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This appears to be God's will, and that also appears to be God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are lost concerning which way is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since they are not conforming to God's will in their walk, thoughts, and work, they do not grow spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We would exhort those who are not seeking God's will to seek after God's will and to be free from self-confidence and self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is our Redeemer, and He has the right to demand obedience from us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is based on God's right; it is also based on His love for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are constrained to seek after His will because His love has touched our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would extend an invitation to those who do not know how to walk in God's will to read the following:</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I. SEEKING FOR GOD'S EXPRESSED WILL</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>INSTEAD OF HIS PERMITTED WILL</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's expressed will is the original will in His heart; God leads and guides us toward His original will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's permitted will is what God permits as a result of man's pleading.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, a father and mother may see a need for a picnic with their children and then take them on an outing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The children may be attracted by the country scenery and request another outing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The parents may not see the need for this, yet because of the request and their failure to dissuade the children, the parents grant the request.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the first case, the parents' expressed will was involved, while in the latter case, the parents' permitted will was involved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What a pity that many believers only ask God to permit them to do certain things, but do not come before Him to ask if He has expressly commanded them to do such things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can understand this point from a case in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Numbers 22, Balak sent men to invite Balaam to curse the Israelites; he enticed Balaam with much gold and many benefits.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Balaam was moved Jude 11; 2 Pet 2:15 , and he wanted to go.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet he feared God and thought that he ought to first inquire of Him before he should make any decision.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God had told him clearly, "You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed" Num 22:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was God's expressed will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Balaam should have canceled his plans right there and refused to go.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But he told the messengers, "Jehovah has refused to let me go with you" v. 13 . How reluctant was his expression refused to let me go! The reason for this reluctance was that he wanted to go, but the Lord would not allow him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Balak baited him the second time with greater honor, Balaam again went to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was strange!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Balaam, did God not clearly tell you His will the last time?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why are you asking God again?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Has your heart been touched by the offer of honor?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Has God been touched by the same thing?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you think that God's will constantly changes?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you not realize that He is the same yesterday, today, and forever?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If Balaam was sincere in doing God's will, he should have told the messengers, "God clearly told me the last time that I should not go.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please go back.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I will not go."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But he was too greedy for gain, and he went to God again.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord then told him, "Rise, go with them" Num 22:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This word means, "Since I cannot keep you back, go."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people do not understand why the messenger of Jehovah tried to stop Balaam and kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They do not realize that his way before the Lord was a "crooked pathway."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is true of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They know the Lord's will in their heart concerning what they should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet their heart craves to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As soon as an opportunity arises, they bother God again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They may refrain for a while, but their heart is far away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When they finally have the Lord's permission, they cannot escape the Lord's rebuke either.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should strive for the Lord's "best," not His "second best."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If our heart is not in a matter, but we still pretend that we are seeking after the Lord's will, the result will be nothing but chastisement.</S>
