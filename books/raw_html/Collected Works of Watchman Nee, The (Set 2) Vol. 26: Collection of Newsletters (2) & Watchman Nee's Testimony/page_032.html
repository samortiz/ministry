<h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM CHUNG CH'UN KENG</h2><p>To my dear brothers in the Lord, Shen Ting Ling and Mark Shen:</p><p>It has been two or three weeks since I parted with the meeting in Hangchow. First I went from Hangchow to Shanghai where I took a steamer to Foochow. In Foochow I finished my business at home and took Chiu Hao, Chiu P'ing, and Chiu Ch'ing to Ku T'ien. Last Saturday (the third) we had a funeral service and buried my father outside of the city. Because of this, I have not had any free time until today to write letters and communicate with you about some of our family matters and the condition of the meeting in Ku T'ien. I pray that God would direct me as to how to arrange my future so that I would glorify Him in all things. This sudden blow was really from the hand of Satan, but he who relies on the Lord will overcome all things. After boarding the steamer in Shanghai, I was not well physically. I got a cold and became seasick. It is difficult to travel alone. But thank the Father God for His care. It did not rain while I was on the boat; therefore, I was able to rest even though I had to sleep outside. When I got to Ku T'ien, some bandits had been on the rampage. A few days before I arrived, bandits and soldiers had been fighting there. On the day I traveled, however, everything was peaceful. It really was the protection of the Father God that I arrived home safely. My family had prepared everything for me, so the funeral was taken care of smoothly. Everything that I went through on this trip saw the care of God.</p><p>Regarding the condition of the meeting in Ku T'ien, God has really begun a good work there, adding saved ones to the church. Although the denominations have used all kinds of methods to stop the meeting, they have been unable to do so. The meeting place is at 1 Pao Hou Alley. Some new brothers, Cheng Tao Kung, Yu Chung Chang, and Chou Hua Nan, and Brother Chen Pi Ying are temporarily living and working together there. In Chao Ku School there are twenty or more new ones who desire the Word. These three new brothers testified to almost every one of them. Through Brother Chen's teaching and the Holy Spirit's own work, several are preparing to obey and be baptized, but they are afraid that the authorities in the school will not permit them. The rest of the students are not able to come and listen to the Word. There are one or two teachers who have a good foundation; the rest also desire the Word. May God Himself work. We also ask you brothers to pray. Yu Hsing and Yu Ching are two girls' schools. The principals of these schools do not let the students come to hear the Word, but several people are trying to find a way to come secretly. The work of Satan behind the scenes is very strong, but the Lord is the Victor. I believe that the Lord will open the way in these two schools. The brothers in the meeting plan to have a Bible study for new ones during the winter vacation. They are still praying about it and looking to the Lord to lead them in everything. I do not know whether the brothers who will come to visit south China can also come to Foochow. If they can, perhaps they can also visit Ku T'ien in northern Fukien and testify for the Lord. There are about ten brothers and sisters in the table meeting. May the Lord bless them and quickly increase their number. How is Brother Ting Ling's health? If you have time, write me a letter and tell me, and I can pray for him. Every time I pray, I do not forget your health and spiritual condition. Brother Mark, what work have you found? I hope you will tell me. I hope, brother, that you patiently and quietly wait in Shanghai. On the one hand, you can receive the truth, and on the other hand, you can learn the truth and learn to serve the brothers. Please greet Brother Tu for me. I have been very busy, but I asked a brother concerning the condition of the church in Foochow, and he said that the meeting in Shio Er Jien Pai has improved markedly. Now there is also a brothers' meeting. They want to do everything openly and bear the responsibility together. Brother Chen Ke San stands in the same position as we do concerning the truth, but he is still waiting. Brother Chang Ch'i Chen does not dare to completely disavow the truth concerning head covering either. May the Spirit of God move them so that the meeting in Foochow will not be separated from the Body. There are not many brothers in the meeting in the Inner City who understand the truth, and there is no one to testify for the truth. Sister Lin Tuan Yu has testified among the sisters. However, as I returned through there today, she seemed very weak. A group of brothers accused her because they thought that what happened in the meeting in the Inner City was the result of her maneuvering. Therefore, she has stopped meeting. I exhorted her a little that one should always testify for truth and that she should not worry because the Lord knows all things. Brother Hsu's will is very strong. His heart will not change even though he and his relative Ch'ung O are the only ones meeting in his home on the Lord's Day. I really thank the Lord that there is a brother who stands firm for the truth. I hope the brothers pray for the work in the city. Although I am in Ku T'ien, I do not forget God's work in Foochow. When I began my trip from Foochow, Brother Hung Kuei came to see me in Brother Shao Hua's home. We walked and talked together. We really could not bear to part. Our eyes were filled with tears. He hoped that Brother Mark and I could teach and guide them after we returned from Hangchow. But now there is no one there, and he is very sad. Brother Chin went to Professor Sung's "Revival Meeting" and offered himself to the evangelistic band. Brother Hung Kuei exhorted him, but he would not listen. He was very impatient, and I did not have time to explain the truth. It is difficult to describe all these situations. I talked to Brothers Wei Kuang and Wei Kuei all night, and they did not want to let me go. It seems that in the Inner City, the sheep are without anyone to care for them. I do not know whether or not Brother Chan has returned home or the condition of his health. Has he improved in the truth this time? Has he come to a decision? How is Brother Nee's health? How is he doing in the work after being newly married? Have there been any storms from the outside? I hope that God gives us grace regarding every truth so that we can carry it out. I will tell you the rest later. Peace and progression!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chung Ch'un Keng<br />November 5</p>
