   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE WALKING IN THE DIVINE RULES AND STEPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 5:25; 6:15-16; Rom 4:12; Phil 3:12-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that there are two kinds of walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first kind of walk refers to our ordinary daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second kind of walk is a walk within a lane or in rank.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we shall consider in more detail the second walk, the walk in the divine rules and steps by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually everyone has two kinds of walk in his human life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first kind of walk is general, a walking about.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This includes all the ordinary things in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second kind of walk is a walk with a specific purpose and toward a definite goal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, each day a young person must take care of the affairs of ordinary life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the first kind of walk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, he must also go to school and study with a view toward graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the second kind of walk, the walk toward a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>TWO KINDS OF WALK</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the Bible, every believer in Christ should have two kinds of walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first walk is our daily walk; the second is the walk in the divine rules and steps.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As Christians, we are not those walking about on earth without a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have been created by God and also re-created and regenerated by Him with a definite purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we must have the second kind of walk, a walk to fulfill God s purpose and to reach the goal of our life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first kind of walk is needed as a support for the second kind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, no student can do well in school if his ordinary daily walk is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he walks in a way that is foolish or nonsensical, he will not be able to graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In such a case he would not have the first walk as a support for the second walk toward the goal of graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second walk, which is related to carrying out our purpose in life, must be sustained by the first walk.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every human being needs to have two kinds of walk.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the first, he lives and walks about; in the second, he accomplishes his purpose on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To fulfill our purpose on earth, we need the second walk.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But to carry out the second walk, we need the first walk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, the first walk supports the second, and the second is the walk toward the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the first kind of walk by the Spirit, we live, have our being, and walk about by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This walk is a support to the second walk, a walk with a direction toward a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As children of God, we are not those without purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our lives on earth have a definite purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not walk about aimlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has an eternal purpose, and His intention is that His people should live for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Both God s creation of us and His regeneration are for the carrying out of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because God is purposeful and seeks to reach His goal, He charges us to have two kinds of walk by the Spirit: the walk which builds up a proper daily living and a walk in line with the divine rules and principles to reach the goal established by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Among today s Christians, both kinds of walk have been damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the first place, many Christians do not live a proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do not have a life of prayer, they do not read the Bible regularly, and they do not contact the Lord consistently.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of walking by the Spirit, they walk by their ethics or morality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They may not steal or lie; however, even though they are good, honest, and faithful, they do not walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, they walk by their own standards.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that in actual practice they walk by the flesh and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They may succeed in refraining from evil, but they do not care for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They care for their taste, choice, preference, and desire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order for us to have a proper living as children of God, we need to have the first kind of walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that we should not walk by anything in place of the Spirit.</S>
