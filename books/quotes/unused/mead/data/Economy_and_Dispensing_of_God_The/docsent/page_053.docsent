   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all know that this one Body refers to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Body of Christ is something mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one can clearly understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even with our physical body, there are many things that medical doctors cannot explain.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even among the Chinese, the Southerners may not like the Northerners.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in the Body of Christ, we all have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We love all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit is the unique factor that unites us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ as the Spirit is the very oneness among us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can have such a oneness because we have the Spirit.</S>
