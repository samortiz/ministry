<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Oneness of the Full Knowledge<br>of the Son of God</H2><P>The oneness in practicality is not only the oneness of the faith but also the oneness of the full knowledge of the Son of God&#151;the full apprehension of the unlimited Christ (Eph. 4:13). There are arguments today not only about Christ's death but also about Christ's person. The Scriptures say that Jesus Christ, as the last Adam, died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected. First Corinthians 15:45b says that in His resurrection, Jesus as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. This is clearly revealed in the Bible, but some rose up against us to claim that it is heresy to say that Christ is the Spirit.</P><P>A number of Christians today believe that the three of the Triune God are three gods. They believe the wrong teaching of tritheism. Tritheism, the teaching that there are three gods, is heresy. The three of the Godhead are distinct, but they are not separate. The three of the Godhead mutually indwell and live in one another. This is called coinherence. In John 14 Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us" (v. 8). The Lord responded, "Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father....Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me" (vv. 9-11). This portion of the Word shows that the Son and the Father are inseparably one. The Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son. Also, the Son is the Father (Isa. 9:6).</P><P>Christ is all-inclusive. He is the Son, He is the Spirit, and He is the Father. He is also a man. Because some are short in the full knowledge of Christ, there are arguments. This is why Paul says that we need the oneness of the unique faith, and we need the oneness of the full, complete knowledge of Christ. We should not be narrow-minded or short-sighted about Christ, because He is all-inclusive.</P><P>People have also condemned us because we have said that our experience of Christ may differ. But this is according to the typology in the Old Testament. One person might bring a bullock to offer, whereas another person who was poor could only bring a small bird (Lev. 1:3, 14). Both of these offerings are types of Christ, but one portion is bigger than the other. This means that one person's experience of Christ can be bigger than another person's experience. The full knowledge of the Son of God is the apprehension of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience. We all need to experience the all-inclusive Christ.</P><P>The four Gospels show that the one Christ has four aspects. John shows that Christ is God. In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, and this Word became flesh (1:1, 14). Luke shows that Christ is a man, Matthew reveals that He is a king, and Mark shows that He is a slave. Christ is all-inclusive, so we have to know Him in full. We should not be narrow-minded or short-sighted about Christ.</P><P>When we are one in knowing Christ, we will have the practical oneness. If we are perfected and completed in knowing Christ, we will not suffer the loss of the oneness of reality in our practice. If we do not practice the oneness properly, we will leave the oneness in reality. Many Christians today in the denominations have left the oneness in reality. By the Lord's mercy, our eyes have been opened to see the divine oneness of the Body of Christ. We know this oneness, and we are also practicing this oneness, the oneness in reality and the oneness in practicality.</P>
