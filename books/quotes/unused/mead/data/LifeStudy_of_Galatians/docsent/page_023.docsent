   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. SLAVERY UNDER LAW A. The Law, Typified by Hagar,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having No Position in God s Promise and Grace</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to see something further concerning slavery under law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The law was typified by Hagar, Abraham s concubine, who had no proper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that in God s promise and grace, the law has no position 4:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As Abraham s wife, Sarah had the proper position in God s promise and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The wife could even tell Abraham to cast out the maidservant and her son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows that the law typified by Hagar has no position in God s promise and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Seventh-Day Adventists need to hear such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In obligating themselves to keep the Sabbath, they place themselves in the position of a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they do this, they have no position in God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. The Law Unable to Give Life</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 3:21 Paul spoke like a skillful debater: If a law was given which was able to give life, righteousness would have indeed been of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the law is composed of dead letters, it cannot give life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since the law is not able to give life, the law cannot produce sons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It can only produce slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ishmael was not a proper son of Abraham; he was a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hagar was not able to produce a son to be Abraham s heir.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because Ishmael s mother was a maidservant, Ishmael also was a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All those who endeavor to keep the law, such as the Seventh-Day Adventists, are today s Ishmaels brought forth by Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. Slaves under Law</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Striving to Keep the Law by the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who strive to keep the law do so, not by the Spirit, but by their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, they do not participate in God s promise and have no enjoyment of life in grace by the Spirit 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Life, grace, and the Spirit have nothing to do with the keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law does not have life, it does not give grace, and it does not depend on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, in the keeping of the law we have no life, grace, or Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, we have only our striving in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>FREEDOM IN CHRIST A. Christ, Being the Life-giving Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Imparting Life by Grace</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we consider the matter of freedom in Christ, we need to see that Christ as the life-giving Spirit imparts life by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This grace is typified by Sarah, the free woman 2:20a; 4:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we have pointed out a number of times, grace is God processed to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1:15 Paul says that God called him through His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that when God called us, He called us by Himself as the One processed to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit imparts life into us by the Triune God who has been processed to become our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many Christians regard grace merely as unmerited favor.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to this concept, to receive something from the Lord that we do not deserve is to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many Christians think that the experience of grace is especially related to receiving material blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This understanding of grace is far from adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In John 1:14 we are told that when the Word Christ became flesh and tabernacled among us, He was full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This surely does not mean that the Word which became flesh was full of material blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, in John 1:16 we are told that of His fullness we have received grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This definitely does not refer to receiving one material blessing upon another.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The grace revealed in the New Testament is the very God incarnate who comes to us to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul says that he labored more than others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this verse he also says that it was not he who labored, but the grace of God which was with him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This indicates that the grace which was with Paul was actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ imparts life into our being by the Triune God processed to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Grace is typified by Sarah, who also typifies God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we have pointed out, Hagar, the concubine, typifies the law.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we come to chapter four, we shall see that these women are an allegory signifying two covenants that bring forth two kinds of children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The grace typified by Sarah is the means Christ uses to impart Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is absolutely different from law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>B. Life, Imparted by Christ, Producing Sons</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>like Isaac to Inherit God s Promise</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The life imparted by Christ produces sons like Isaac, sons of the free woman, who inherit God s promise 4:28, 30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we received Christ as life, we became sons of God to inherit the blessing promised by God for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>C. Sons of Promise</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Participating in God s Grace of Life,</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Enjoying Freedom of Life</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As sons of promise, we participate in God s grace of life and thereby enjoy the freedom of life 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This means that we have liberation from obligation, and we have satisfaction, rest, and the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the freedom that is versus slavery under law.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Galatians 2:4 presents the basic contrast between freedom in Christ and slavery under law.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This indicates the fact that the book of Galatians gives us a number of basic truths and principles so that we may know God s New Testament economy in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some saints in the Lord s recovery still may not be clear about God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These messages on Galatians should help all of us to know God s economy in a basic way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is crucial for us to understand the basic terms, truths, and principles presented in Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thus far, we have covered two basic matters.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The first is God s Son versus man s religion; the second is freedom in Christ versus slavery under law.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to know the Son of God and also man s religion and tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We also must know the contrast between freedom in Christ and slavery under law.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Praise the Lord for our freedom in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We are not in slavery under law we enjoy freedom in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We are free from obligation, and we have satisfaction, rest, and enjoyment in Christ.</S>
