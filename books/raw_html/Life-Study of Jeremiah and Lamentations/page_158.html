<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The King, Whose Name Is Jehovah of Hosts,<br>Striking the Land of Egypt and Casting Down<br>Her Army by Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon</H2><P>The King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts, struck the land of Egypt and cast down her army by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was a gadfly from the north coming on Egypt as a beautiful heifer. Jehovah, the God of Israel, punished Amon (the most honorable god in Egypt), Pharaoh, Egypt, and her gods and kings, even Pharaoh and those who trusted in him, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the hand of his servants. Afterward she will be inhabited as in the days of old (vv. 13-26; 43:10-13; 44:11-30; cf. Isa. 19:1-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. A Word of Comfort to Israel</H2><P>Jeremiah 46:27-28 is a word of comfort to Israel. These verses say, "But as for you, O Jacob My servant, do not fear; / And do not be dismayed, O Israel. / For, behold, I will save you from afar/And your seed from the land of their captivity; / And Jacob will return and be undisturbed / And at ease, and no one will frighten him. / As for you, O Jacob My servant, do not fear, declares Jehovah, / For I am with you; / For I will make a full end of all the nations / To which I have driven you; / Yet I will not make a full end of you, / But will correct you in measure / And will by no means leave you unpunished." Jeremiah declared God's judgment on Egypt because Israel depended on Egypt, thus offending God. Israel also suffered that judgment, so Jeremiah gave Israel this word of comfort, saying that God will come to visit them and bring them back to their land. This word will be fulfilled at the time of the restoration to come, in the thousand-year kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT<br>AND JUDGMENT UPON THE PHILISTINES</H2><P>Chapter forty-seven concerns Jehovah's punishment and judgment upon the Philistines.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Nation Typifying the World<br>That Is Close to the Interest of God on the Earth and That Attacks and Damages<br>the Testimony of God on the Earth</H2><P>The Philistines were a nation called Philistia (Exo. 15:14). The Philistines typify the world that is close to the interest of God on earth and attacks and damages the testimony of God on earth. In the Old Testament the Philistines came several times to bother Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Located alongside the Nation of Israel</H2><P>The Philistines were located alongside the nation of Israel.</P>
