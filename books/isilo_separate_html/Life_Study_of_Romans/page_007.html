Glorification&mdash;the Purpose of Salvation</h2><p>The next section in the book of Romans is glorification (Rom. 8:14-39), unveiling the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation. Following sanctification, there is the need of glorification. Our body needs to be glorified. Although a brother may be quite saintly, his body needs to be glorified because of its physical defects and limitations. When the Lord Jesus comes, we will be glorified. Presently, I must wear thick, peculiar eyeglasses, but when the Lord comes I will be glorified. We shall not only be justified and sanctified; we shall be glorified, that is, our body shall be redeemed. Glorification is the full redemption of our body.</p><p>This glorification reveals the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation. The purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is to produce many brothers to Christ. Originally, Christ was the only begotten Son of God. Now the only begotten Son has become the firstborn Son. We ourselves will be processed into the many brothers of Christ and the many sons of God. In the next message we will see that Christ is the prototype and that we are His duplication, the mass production. The little Jesus has been processed and designated as the Son of God, and we also are in the same process to be designated as the many sons of God. He is the firstborn Son, and we, the many sons, are His many brothers. This is the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Selection&mdash;the Economy of Salvation</h2><p>After glorification, we come to selection which reveals the economy of salvation (Rom. 9:1&mdash;11:36). God has a purpose and an economy. His economy is for the fulfillment of His purpose. God is very wise and He arranges everything for the fulfillment of His purpose. He knows what He is doing. He knows who are His chosen people and He knows when His chosen people should be called. In relation to God, selection is for the accomplishment of His purpose; in relation to us, selection is our destiny.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Transformation&mdash;the Life-practice in Salvation</h2><p>After this, we have the section on transformation, unfolding the life-practice in salvation (Rom. 12:1&mdash;15:13). In this section we see the life-practice of all that has been produced by the life-process. Whatever is produced in the section on sanctification is practiced in the section on transformation. Eventually, sanctification becomes transformation. In one sense, we are in sanctification; in another sense, we are also in transformation. We are in the process of life and in the practice of life that we may have the Body life with a proper private life. Every aspect of the proper Christian life and church life is included in this section on transformation. While we are being sanctified, we are also being transformed from one form into another form and from one shape into another shape. Praise the Lord! We are all under the life-process of sanctification for the life-practice of transformation.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Conclusion&mdash;<br />the Ultimate Consummation of Salvation</h2><p>The last section of the book of Romans is the conclusion, indicating the ultimate consummation of salvation (Rom. 15:14&mdash;16:27). The ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s salvation is the churches&mdash;not just the Body, but the local churches as the expressions of the Body. Hallelujah! The book of Romans begins with the Gospel of God and concludes with the local churches. In Romans, we do not have the local church in doctrine but the local churches in practice. As we will see in later messages, many churches are mentioned in Romans chapter 16.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE MAJOR STRUCTURES OF ROMANS</h2><p>The major structures of the book of Romans are three&mdash; salvation, life, and building.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Salvation</h2><p>The first major structure of Romans is salvation, revealed in 1:1&mdash;5:11 and 9:1&mdash;11:36. Salvation includes propitiation, redemption, justification, reconciliation, selection, and predestination. In eternity past God predestinated us. Then He called us, redeemed us, justified us, and reconciled us to Himself. Thus, we have full salvation.</p><p>We need to differentiate between redemption and salvation. Redemption is what Christ accomplished in the eyes of God. Salvation is what God has wrought upon us based upon the redemption of Christ. Redemption is objective, and salvation is subjective. When redemption becomes our experience, it becomes salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Life</h2><p>Salvation is for the life unfolded in 5:12&mdash;8:39. In this section the word life is used at least seven times and, according to chapter 8, this life is four-fold, which we will see as we come to that chapter.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Building</h2><p>In the last part of Romans, 12:1&mdash;16:27, we have the building, the Body with all of its expressions in the local churches. Salvation is for life, and life is for building. Thus, the three major structures of Romans are salvation, life, and building.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
