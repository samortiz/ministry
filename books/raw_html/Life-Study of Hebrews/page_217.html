<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SIXTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE LAW OF LIFE<br />SPREADING IN OUR INWARD PARTS</h1><h2 class="head1">THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br />IN THE BIBLE</h2><p>If we would thoroughly understand and apprehend the law of life, we must understand the basic concept of the divine revelation in the Bible. The basic and central concept in the Bible is that God intends to work Himself into us in order to make us His living expression. God desires to work Himself into His chosen people that they may be born of Him and have Him as their life and thus become His expression. This is God&rsquo;s desire and intention. The only way for God to have such a living expression is for Him to work Himself into us. Although this basic concept is found throughout the Bible, it has nearly been lost by fundamental Christianity. Fundamental Christianity mainly stresses redemption. But redemption is not the goal; it is a way, a procedure, to reach the goal. The goal is to have God wrought into our being that we might be born of Him and that He might become our life. He is our Father and we are His sons. Being His sons, we all have Him in us as our life. Eventually, this life will transform us and conform us to His very image, making us His living expression in the universe.</p><p>Although this basic concept has nearly been lost, we thank God that now, in these last days, He has opened up to us this matter in His Word. For more than forty years, we have been burdened to minister this basic concept to God&rsquo;s people. It is for this reason that we have been falsely accused of teaching heresy, of preaching and teaching something that is not according to the Bible. Our opposers say this because their understanding of the Bible is lacking and inadequate. A little knowledge is dangerous, for it makes people short-sighted and even kills them. We praise God that under His mercy we have seen the basic revelation in the Scriptures. This is not simply a matter of redemption. No, it is something deeper and higher than this. God is now working Himself into us that we may have His life, that we may be one with Him, and that He may be one with us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SON OF GOD<br />COMING INTO US AS LIFE</h2><p>I say again that the way in which God accomplishes His intention is by coming into us, causing us to be born of Him. In order that we might be born of Him, God comes into us in the Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and God Himself, is God&rsquo;s image. Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God. The Son is the image, the expression, of the Father. Thus, when you see the Son, you see the Father. At the moment we believed in Him, the Son of God came into us. This does not mean that He gave us something; it means that He Himself came into us. We need to discard the concept that when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, God gave us His life. This understanding is incorrect. It was not that we believed in the Lord Jesus and that God in heaven gave us something and put it into us. No, it was that we believed in the Lord Jesus and that the Son of God, the very God Himself, came into us as life. God did not give us His life; He came into us as life. What a great difference!</p><p>When God comes into us, He comes in the Son and as the Son, not as the Father. This involves the Trinity. It is at this point that we are accused of teaching heresy. But we do not teach heresy&mdash;we speak the truth according to the pure word of God. The very person who has come into our being is God Himself. But when He comes into us, He does not come as the Father but as the Son. The Father is the source, and the Son is the expression of the source. The expression and the source are one.</p>
