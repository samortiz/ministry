Because of the decline and desolation of the church, however, we must also know a most basic negative item in the church's desolation
They were severely rebuked by the Apostle Paul, who had led them to salvation and who had established them as the church
These unreasonable and strange things are actually being established, supported, respected, and promoted by a majority of Christians!
Rather, they should imitate the Apostle Paul to condemn and deny these things which offend Christ, sadden God, and grieve the Holy Spirit
They also show us that there are always factions and divisions before the formation of a sect, and envyings after its establishment
The following three key elements are the factors which cause the Christians to be divided, to be constituted as sects
Such special fellowships cause those believers who practice them to be constituted as sects separate from the believers in general
These special names in a more tangible way cause those who so label themselves to be constituted into named sects resulting in denominations
The believers should only possess the unique and honorable name of Jesus Christ, and not exalt any other name besides this preeminent name
The Spirit, that is, the Holy Spirit who lives in us, causes us to be constituted into the Body of Christ with God's life
If we believers would live in this Spirit and walk according to this Spirit, the oneness of the Body of Christ would be kept
We must endeavor to live in the Body of Christ to keep the oneness of the Body, not participating in any divisions, sects, or denominations
The spiritual life we believers have received, being the life of God in us, also possesses many characteristics
On their way, when they discovered that it was the Lord who had appeared to them, the Lord disappeared from them
When they arrived, they found the apostles and those with them assembled together, and the Lord appeared among them
3And when the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled they were all together in the same place and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit was poured upon the disciples when they were meeting together, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly
1)'If two of you agree on earth concerning anything, whatever they may ask, it shall come to them from My Father who is in the heavens
It says here that in those days when the disciples were under persecution, they met together to pray with one accord
That kind of prayer caused them to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit and to speak the word of God with boldness
4)'Prayer was being made fervently by the church to God concerning him' ; 'where a considerable number were assembled together praying'
1)'Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
Since we are the Lord's and were saved by His name, we should gather only into that name and meet in that name
2)'And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house'
The church should have regular separate home meetings and should gather together in one place as the need arises
1And having taken a loaf He broke it and gave it to them saying This is My body which is given for you do this unto the remembrance of Me
In such a meeting, we should think of the Lord in our hearts and behold the Lord in our spirit that we would be inspired concerning the Lord
1)'The Lord Jesus took bread broke it and said, This is My body, which is for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me'
According to what the Lord said, the bread signifies His body that He gave for us and the cup signifies the blood that He shed for us
The Lord's body being broken to be given as bread to us means that He gave His body for us that we may have His life
In the Bible, the bread denotes life and the cup signifies 'portion,' such as 'Jehovah is the portion of my cup'
The Lord's body and His blood are He Himself given for us and the means by which He accomplished all things for us
While we are remembering the Lord, we display the Lord's death for ourselves, the angels, and all things to see
In this way, when we eat and drink together, sharing in the Lord's bread and the Lord's cup, we 'partake of the table of the Lord'
At this table, we share in the Lord's body and the Lord's blood with all the saints and have fellowship one with another
1)'Jesus took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body
On that day, after the Lord Jesus broke bread and sang a hymn with the disciples, He led them to the Mount of Olives to meet with the Father
According to this fact, after we have broken the bread in remembrance of the Lord, we should be led by the Lord to worship the Father
Only those who are saved, who are joined unto the Lord, and who do not live in sin are qualified to eat the bread and drink the cup
At the time, because they were fervent toward the Lord and loved Him deeply, they spontaneously broke bread every day
In the evening, having finished all our work and having discharged all our burdens, we are lightened in heart and refreshed in spirit
It is a proper time in which we can remember the Lord without anxiety, and it is easy to sense the Lord's presence then
Those who break bread to remember the Lord should be those who long for the Lord, wait for His coming, and love His appearing
2)'You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and of the table of demons'
3Let us therefore keep the feast not with old leaven nor with leaven of malice and evil but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
The basis of our consecration to the Lord is that, since He bought us with His blood as a price , we have become His purchased slaves
We who believe in the Lord and who are redeemed and bought by the Lord are the purchased slaves of the Lord we are not our own but the Lords
His buying us with His precious blood to make us His purchased slaves is the basis on which we consecrate ourselves to Him
1I beg you therefore brothers through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice which is your most reasonable service
In the Old Testament, God required that His people offer the burnt offering to Him daily for His food that He could be satisfied
Although the nature of the two are different, their significance is the same, that is, to be God's food for His satisfaction
4)'For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God before prepared that we should walk in them'
4)'The priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah'
The result of offering a burnt sacrifice in the Old Testament was that the burnt offering became ashes before men and a sweet savor to God
A great part of our practical experience of the Holy Spirit is related to our being filled inwardly and outwardly with Him
On the one hand, the Lord spoke of the Holy Spirit being in us; on the other hand, He spoke of the Holy Spirit being upon us
These are the words of the Lord before His death, promising the disciples that He would go in order to send the Holy Spirit as the Comforter
The Comforter was the One who would enter into the disciples and be 'in' them, while the power would come 'upon' them
The Holy Spirit brought in on the day of resurrection is the 'Comforter,' and the Holy Spirit who descended at Pentecost is the 'power'
Surely this refers to the Holy Spirit as life within us, drunk by us as the living water to be our life supply
He had not only an abundant life and wisdom to serve many tables, but also an overcoming life and faith to stand for the Lord unto death
1)'But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control'
In order to be filled with the Holy Spirit, we must first receive the dealing with our flesh through our co-death with Christ on the cross
1)The Holy Spirit will fill us-the Holy Spirit already lives in us, longs to fill us, and is waiting for us to give Him the ground
Now that we have thoroughly dealt with ourselves, giving all the ground to Him, He will surely come and fill us
In this way, we not only can be filled with the Holy Spirit instantly, but we also can be full of the Holy Spirit constantly
It was separately fulfilled in two parts because the church is composed of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles
1)Being baptized in the Holy Spirit upon believing-'For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks'
When we are filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, with the Holy Spirit of power coming upon us, we experience the baptism in the Spirit
The experience of the baptism in the Spirit takes place on the individual believers and is instant and numerous
A believer can receive the fact of the baptism in the Spirit only once, but he may experience the baptism in the Spirit many times
The outward filling of the Holy Spirit also confirms to us the Lord's ascension and exaltation and His being appointed both Lord and Christ
While being filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly, the believers in Ephesus not only spoke in tongues, but they also prophesied
To speak for God with boldness and power is also a strong manifestation of the outward filling with the Holy Spirit
1)Repenting and dealing with sins-'Repent for the forgiveness of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit'
To be filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly, there is the need for thorough repentance and dealing with all sins
The gospel is the glad tidings and the good news of great joy, which God asked His servants to announce to men
Christ's death, by which He bore our sins, His burial, and His resurrection are also the main contents of the gospel
What Christ is, His person as the God-man, and what Christ has done, His work of redemption, constitute the contents of the gospel
1)'Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
1)Burning in spirit-'Being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus'
7Leaving allOne who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospels sake
2)Being filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit- 'They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness'
To fulfill our prayer for the preaching of the gospel, there needs to be the outward filling with the Holy Spirit
To be able to preach the gospel, express the Lord's life, and bear the fruit of life, one must follow the leading of the Holy Spirit
To this end, the booklet 'The Mystery of Human Life' published by Living Stream Ministry is highly recommended
A saved person wishes to serve the Lord, not out of others' encouragement or compelling, but out of an inward motive
2)'I beg you therefore through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice which is your most reasonable service'
3)Being the members of Christ's Body-'But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body , even as He willed'
When we fulfill our office to minister in the Body of Christ according to our function, we are also serving the Lord
5)Caring for the saints-'Console the fainthearted, uphold the weak' ; 'Communicating to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality'
These words show us that we ought to care for those saints who are immature, weak, sick, needy, or in hardship
To shepherd and oversee the flock of God, which are the saints in the church, is to serve the church and is quite valuable
1Serving with our whole beingPresent your bodies be transformed by the renewing of the mind burning in spirit serving the Lord as a slave
To serve the Lord with our whole being means that the spirit, soul, and body all participate in the service to the Lord
3)According to the counsel of God-'For David indeed, when he had served his own generation by the counsel of God '
6)Being faithful and prudent-'Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household'
The Lord tells us that to serve Him as His slaves we need to have our loins girded and our lamps burning and we need to wait for His return
8)Coordinating in the Body-'For also the body is not one member but many If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing?
Now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed But now the members are many, but one body
1)Receiving many lashes-'And that slave who knew his lord's will, and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes'
The Lord did not tell us how the punishment will be carried out but any punishment especially that which is repeated many times is dreadful
May we who have received grace to be the Lord's slaves to serve Him be admonished and warned because of His word
In the original language, the service mentioned by the Lord here refers to the service of a slave, as we have seen in the previous lesson
We have received God's mercy and the Lord's salvation, which delivered us from the authority of Satan and turned us to God
In the last twenty-three lessons we covered seventeen subjects concerning the various crucial matters between us and God
1)'Nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who affords us all things richly for our enjoyment'
We must not set our hope on deceitful and uncertain material riches, but on the very God who gives us all things for our enjoyment
In this matter of material supply, unlike the worldly people who trust only in their own abilities, we have to learn to set our hope in God
Doing this will enable one to lay hold on, that is, to possess, to use, and to enjoy, that which is really life, the eternal life of God
1)'Give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will give into your bosom'
The best way to be blessed by God in material riches is to give, not to receive, just as the Lord Himself did for us
3)'He who sows sparingly, sparingly also shall reap; and he who sows with blessings, with blessings also shall reap'
Since sowing eventually brings in reaping, he who sows sparingly shall reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully shall reap bountifully
The 'tithes' are the legal amount of offering which God required from the harvest of the Israelites in the Old Testament
The 'storehouse' refers to the place in the Old Testament temple where all the offerings to God from His people were stored
Although it was spoken to the Israelites in the Old Testament, in principle it applies also to the New Testament believers
1)For the need of the church-In the Old Testament, God wanted each of His people, the Israelites, to offer to Him a ransom for his soul
We, all the New Testament believers, also should offer to God to meet the needs of the different expenses in the church where we are
We should determine the amount of our offering to God based upon the condition of our being prospered due to His blessing
Each person should determine his own amount according to whatever he has, not according to what he does not have
In our offering of material riches, we will reap little if we sow little, and we will reap much if we sow much
Each person should purpose in his own heart how much he should offer without sorrow or necessity since God loves him who is a cheerful giver
According to the Lord's charge in these words, we should do our best not to let others know of our offering of material riches
Supplying the saints with material riches is a fellowship which brings mutual grace to both the giver and the receiver
Doing good refers to the distribution of material riches to others, which before God is a well-pleasing sacrifice to God
Our offering of material things to God's servants is also an acceptable sacrifice which is well-pleasing to God
4)A fragrant odor well-pleasing to God-'Receiving the things from you, a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God'
The four significances of the offering of material riches mentioned above should show us the importance and value of such offering
Riches that deceive men, corrupt men, and destroy men can actually become such transcendent blessings that we have before God!
