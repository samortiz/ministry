   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Believing That One Has Received</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters, God cannot tell us to believe that which is unbelievable.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some brothers and sisters will let go and resign when you ask them to do so, but they cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While they say that they believe, they also say that they prefer to wait and see for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is true that letting go is an important step.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But a more important step is allowing the Lord Jesus to live out His victory from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once we let go, we should believe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God says that if we believe that the Lord has died for us on the cross, He will give us eternal life, and if we believe that the Lord is living within us, He will give us the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I know that this is where many people have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They cannot believe that the Lord is living within them, and they cannot believe that the Lord has overcome for them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I asked one sister whether she had let go, she said yes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I asked how she let go, she said, I tell God that I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I will not take charge of anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From now on, I will commit everything to Him whether I experience victory or failure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, if you asked this sister whether she had experienced victory, she would say that she dare not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why would she dare not say anything?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She answered that she did not feel that she had overcome and had not seen the effect of overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I told her that if she believed in God s fact and if she believed that the Lord Jesus is the victory and that He lives in her, she should believe immediately that she has overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if she looked for results, she would never experience victory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, the way to receive grace to overcome is the same as the way to receive grace for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We tell a sinner that Jesus has died for him on the cross and that when he believes, his sins will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If this person believes, his sins will surely be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you ask whether or not he has believed, he may say that he has.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if you ask whether or not his sins are forgiven, he may say no. Why is this? He may answer, saying, I have heard that when a man is forgiven of his sins, he will have joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not have joy and peace yet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I must kneel down to pray until I have joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then I can say that my sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If someone says something like this, you will surely say to him, Even if you kneel and pray for a year for joy and peace, you will not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You will have joy and peace when you believe that they will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same way, if you fulfill the condition for God to give you victory, if you let go, if you resign, and if you lose hope in yourself, you can immediately believe that you have received the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s Son is living out His victory within you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once you believe, the result will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if you wait for the result to come, you will never see the result even if you kneel and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers and sisters, if you want to wait for the result before you dare say that you have the overcoming life, you are believing your own experience and not God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers and sisters, once we believe in the Lord s Word, the experience will follow, the feeling will follow, and the victory will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul did not say that he felt that he had overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He said, The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although you may feel that you are cold and that there is nothing to smile about, you can still thank and praise the Lord, saying, The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I may look healthy and vigorous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But actually there is not a day when I do not feel tired.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to my feeling, there is not a day that is exciting to me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every day that I wake up, I feel cold and indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Satan comes to me many times and says, You do not experience any feeling of joy; every day you are so cold and indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is this what you mean by having Jesus living within you?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You were cold and indifferent in the past, and you are cold and indifferent now.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is this the experience of victory in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When this happens, God always gives me an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I tell Satan, If I feel anything, it will be myself who is living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if I believe, I will be living by faith in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I feel anything, it will be my flesh that feels it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But if I believe, I will live by faith in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is my flesh that feels, but it is God s Word that I believe.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you believe in God s Word, the Lord will live out His victory within you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God says that as long as you fulfill the condition, Christ will live out His victory for you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You can therefore say, God, I thank and praise You!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What I feel does not count.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The greatest lie in the world is my feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Feelings and Satan are the best companions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God, I thank You because I can believe in Your Word and not in my feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only God s Word is real; all feelings are lies.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, brothers and sisters, no matter what kind of temptation comes and no matter what kind of feeling you have, you should say, I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I do not bear any responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I let go.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once you let go and believe, you will see the Son of God fighting the battle for you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He will overcome for you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Son of God has taken away your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He has taken away your stubbornness, pride, and jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hallelujah, there is only one Overcomer in the whole world!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Everyone is weak!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hallelujah, we are all failures, and we are all useless!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hallelujah, only the Lord is the Overcomer!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hallelujah, throughout history there is only one Overcomer!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hallelujah, this is the reason we boast in the Lord Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Brothers and sisters, what do we have that we did not receive?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What can we boast?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do you point your finger at the robbers and the prostitutes?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Except for God s grace, we would be the same as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hallelujah, we are not changed but exchanged!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Brothers and sisters, all we have to do is fulfill the conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>On the one hand, we cannot make it, and we should not try to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>On the other hand, we live in the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is victory.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hallelujah, He has accomplished everything!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have to ask God to show us that His Son has accomplished everything and that we do not have any part in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is victory.</S>
