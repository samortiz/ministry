The total significance of these three names is that at an appointed time Jehovah will bless and Jehovah will remember
Even today in the building up of the church as the Body of Christ, we need both the priesthood and the kingship
In this central thought there are several important factors Gods sympathy redemption salvation the Savior the Redeemer and the Deliverer
In this consoling work, Christ was sent to accomplish redemption for their salvation, making Christ their Savior as well as their Redeemer
In this universe we see Christ on the cross as the center, and from that center Christ is spreading Himself to the circumference
Ephesians tells us that this redeeming Christ who produced the Body, the church, is the One who fills all in all
God's real concern is for Israel, and all the nations are utilized by God for Israel's benefit, both positively and negatively
In Daniel all the nations are sovereignly under God's heavenly ruling for Israel to be God's witness and testimony on earth
All of Satan's devices merely resulted in God's testimony being strengthened and uplifted through His young overcomers
The book of Isaiah unveils Christ in many items, mainly concerning Christ's being, that is, concerning what Christ is
In Daniel we see that Christ in His crucifixion is the landmark between God's old creation and God's new creation
In His appearing to the prophet, He was the excellent and precious One for the appreciation and expectation of the people of God
We also see that in His humiliation He goes with them through their suffering to be their Savior in a fine and sympathetic way
The Angel of Jehovah is also the Angel of God who escorted and protected Israel on their way from Egypt to the promised land
As Christ was riding on a red horse, He was standing among the myrtle trees that were in the bottoms of the valley
Although they were the redeemed people of God , as the reddish-brown horses indicate, they were not that pure but were a mixture
Eventually, as signified by the white horses, when the redeemed people of God come to God and are dealt with, they will be justified
In the eyes of God, Christ the Redeemer was with them taking the lead, and they, God's redeemed people, were following Him
The man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are those whom Jehovah has sent to go to and fro on the earth
As indicated by the movement of the horses, God's captured people were unsettled and were without peace, rest, and the enjoyment of life
Because the nations were sitting peacefully while Jerusalem was in trouble, Jehovah was very jealous for Jerusalem
Christ is the One among the craftsmen who will come as the stone cut out without hands to smash the great image
Each of the first three kingdoms Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Greece was taken over in a skillful way by the kingdom which followed it
They all have been or, in the case of the restored Roman Empire, will be destroyed by the four craftsmen raised up by God
Whereas the temple is the sign of God's house, the city of Jerusalem is a sign of God's kingdom for His administration
The measuring has revealed two important matters: that God's kingdom is unlimited and that God Himself is the size of His kingdom
In verse 6b Jehovah declares concerning His people, 'I have spread you out like the four winds of the heavens'
If the children of Israel had not been captured, God's testimony would have been limited to the small city of Jerusalem with its temple
When the children of Israel were scattered to Babylon, four young people became witnesses of God and a testimony for Him
Ephesians 1 tells us that God the Father chose and predestinated us, that God the Son redeemed us, and that God the Spirit sealed us
Hypostasis refers to a support under, a support beneath, that is, something underneath that supports, a supporting substance
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the hypostases, the supporting substances, that compose the one Godhead
In verse 10 the daughter of Zion is commanded to give a ringing shout and rejoice, for now Jehovah is coming and will dwell in their midst
While Joshua was standing before the Angel of Jehovah, he was resisted by Satan, who was standing at his right hand to accuse him
The word Satan means 'the accuser,' 'the adversary,' and it is the base for the word accuse at the end of verse 1
As the adversary, Satan's intention was to put Joshua down in front of his fellows and to frustrate the rebuilding of God's temple
God is in front of us, and the evil one is at our right hand to resist us, to oppose us, to accuse us, and to be our adversary
Every day we speak a lot, and the matters we cover in our talk or gossip may be either dirty or with an evil intention to defame others
In verses 8 through 10 Christ as the Angel of Jehovah strengthened Joshua with Zerubbabel the governor of Judah
The priesthood may be compared to the legislative branch of the government, and the kingship, to the executive branch
In God's administration legislative matters are decided by God Himself through the Urim and the Thummim worn by the high priest
Through the exercise of the kingship by the older, experienced ones, the church is saved from anarchy and preserved in a good order
For the church life, we as God's people with His administration must have both the priesthood and the kingship
One function of the priesthood is to teach us how to worship God and how to have the proper remembrance of the Lord at the Lord's table
In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus says, 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness'
The previous vision in chapter three concerning Joshua is to strengthen Joshua the high priest in the priesthood
The vision of the golden lampstand and the two olive trees in chapter four is to strengthen Zerubbabel the governor of Judah in the kingship
Although Zerubbabel was not actually a king, he was nevertheless a descendant, a shoot, of the royal family of David
In chapter three Joshua was measured, and as a result of that measuring, he was strengthened and established through the cleansing
The strengthening of Joshua in the priesthood and of Zerubbabel in the kingship are both for the rebuilding of the temple
The expression of the lampstand is the seven lamps, signifying the Spirit as the sevenfold intensified expression
These two, Moses and Elijah, will support and supply the persecuted Israelites and the believers during the great tribulation
For this shining there must be the burning, and in order for there to be the burning, there must be the supply of olive oil
In Zechariah 4:11 the prophet says to the angel, 'What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left'?
When the bowl of the lampstand is void of oil, the two trees will supply oil by flowing it out through the branches and into the two spouts
As we apply this matter to our experience today, we see that the Spirit who flows out of us is God, and God is gold
Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain, and he will bring forth the topstone with shouts of Grace, grace to it
Whereas chapter three refers to Christ's death for redemption, chapter four speaks of the Spirit for the carrying out of God's economy
According to Revelation 5:6, these seven eyes are the seven Spirits, that is, the sevenfold intensified Spirit
Although the Father and the Son are distinct, they are essentially one in the accomplishment of eternal redemption
As the result of this redemption, we may now enjoy Christ as the Spirit, even as the sevenfold intensified Spirit
From all this we see that redemption has been accomplished by the Son, and now the Spirit is supplied to us for God's building
In the first five visions which Zechariah saw God spoke a comforting consoling and encouraging word to Joshua Zerubbabel and the people
These three visions are the vision of the flying scroll , the vision of the ephah vessel , and the vision of the four chariots
The law of God is a testimony to the whole world, and the two squares of ten cubits by ten cubits is the completion in fullness of the law
The apostle Paul could keep many of the Ten Commandments, but he could not fulfill the commandment concerning coveting
Swearing falsely by Jehovah's name signifies sins toward God, which are the issue of a wrong relationship with God
The appearance of business is not that bad; rather, in all the land commerce seems to have a proper appearance
These visions show us that in the sight of God the wickedness contained in commerce is a kind of idolatry and fornication
In Zechariah 5:7 and 8 we see that a lead cover, a lead weight, is thrown over the opening of the ephah vessel
The one woman becoming two women signifies the double effect of commerce once it becomes free of the restriction
He said to me, To build a house for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place'
In chapter five the vision of the flying scroll reveals that God's righteous law and its justice cannot allow any unrighteousness on earth
These four chariots signify the four winds from the four corners of the earth for God's judgment of sins upon the earth
In particular, they are used by God to carry out His judgment, not mainly on people but on nations, governments, and kingdoms
In the vision in Zechariah 1:18-21, Zechariah saw four horns which were raised up to damage and destroy God's people Israel
The first of these craftsmen was the Persian Empire, sovereignly used by God to destroy Babylon, the first horn
These horses of different colors, red, black, white, and speckled, signify the different manners of God's judgment
In an instant He will crush the great human image from the toes to the head, terminating the entire human government on this earth
Zechariah 6:9-15 is the concluding word to confirm the eight visions of comfort, consolation, and encouragement
In all of history He is the only person who is qualified to bear the responsibilities of these two offices in God's administration
In Genesis 14 Melchizedek was first a king, and then he came as a priest to Abraham, ministering the bread and the wine
The crowning of Joshua was an assurance to the people that God would do something to accomplish the rebuilding of the temple
The people wept fasted and separated themselves in the fourth month to express their grieving for the breaking down of the city of Jerusalem
God's people also wept, fasted, and separated themselves in the seventh month to express their grieving for the murder of Gedaliah
Israel was advised not only to turn from the vanity of their ritualistic religion but also to turn to the reality of a godly life
Old men and old women will dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, each with his staff in his hand due to the multitude of his days
The vine will give forth its fruit; the land will give forth its produce; and the heavens will give their dew, that is, their rain
Because of these blessings, the entire country will be fruitful and productive for the enjoyment of the people
The nations will come to Israel to entreat the favor, the grace, of Jehovah, and the children of Israel will be priests to them
They will teach the Gentiles, the nations, to know God's way and God's person, and they will teach them to worship and serve God
In some way God will reverse the situation of Babel and deal with the problem caused by the different languages among the nations
God's intention according to Exodus 19:6 was to have Israel as a nation of priests, and He has never forgotten this
The nations were formerly idol worshippers or atheists, but they all will turn to God, and God will turn to them to be their God
A time of restoration will come among you, and the nations will turn to you and will come to dwell with you as God's people
During the millennial kingdom, Israel will be in the earthly part, whereas we, the New Testament believers, will be in the heavenly part
We will be the kings, the co-kings with Christ, and we will also be the priests, the heavenly priests, to serve God
Christ is wrapped up with every crucial aspect of the four empires signified by the great human image in Daniel 2
He is righteous and bears salvation; / Lowly and riding upon a donkey, / Even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey'
Verses 1 through 7 speak concerning the damage and devastation Alexander the Great caused to the nations surrounding Judah
As verse 10 indicates, after His coming peace and restoration should be here, and God's dominion should also be here
Antiochus Epiphanes was the first type of the coming Antichrist, who will do the evil things prophesied in Daniel 8:10-13, 23-25; 11:30-32a
Verse 13 is saying that at the time of Antiochus Epiphanes God would stir up His sons, the sons of Zion, against the sons of Greece
And they will drink they will be noisy as if with wine And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin Like the corners of the altar
Verses 2 and 3a say The teraphim have spoken vanity And the diviners have seen a lie And have spoken false dreams they comforted in vain
Among the Jews in the ancient time, many possessed teraphim, which were images or false gods kept in their homes
Verse 3 tells us that the Lord's anger was kindled against the shepherds and that He would punish the male goats
Jehovah of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, / And will make them like His horse of majesty in battle'
Of course, chapter ten does not mention the name Jesus Christ or Messiah, but the word visited here should be understood as Christ's coming
He came as the real Shepherd and blamed the other shepherds, who were the elders, the scribes, and the priests
On the one hand, the Lord punished the false shepherds; on the other hand, He, the real Shepherd, has visited His flock
Zechariah 104 continues From him will come forth the cornerstone from him the peg From him the battle bow From him every ruler together
Verse 4 indicates that when we become horses of majesty, we become a source of cornerstones, pegs, battle bows, and rulers
The house of Judah and the people of Ephraim will be as mighty men trampling their enemies, for Jehovah is with them
Jehovah will bring them back, for He has had compassion on them, and it will be as though Jehovah had not rejected them
Verse 12 concludes, 'I will strengthen them in Jehovah, / And they will walk about in His name, / Declares Jehovah'
To be in God's name is to be one with God in our daily walk, living, walking, and having our being in God's name
We are not that bold or strong but after the Lords visitation with His dear touch we are strengthened to become horses of majesty in battle
What is to die will die, and what is to be destroyed will be destroyed, and those who are left will each eat one another's flesh
It was broken in that day; and thus the afflicted of the flock, who watched me, knew that it was the word of Jehovah'
The Lord Jesus as the proper Shepherd was rejected, leaving the children of Israel as a flock without any shepherd
The priests, the elders, and the scribes were all annulled, and Jesus was crucified, rejected to the uttermost
The children of Israel were therefore left to the foolish and worthless shepherds, who would not take care of them
Concerning this Matthew 2631 a quotation of Zechariah 137 says I will smite the Shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered
Chapter ten reveals this kind, intimate, and gentle One as the Shepherd coming in His loving visitation to Israel
During the three and a half years of His ministry on earth, He ministered the spiritual supply to God's chosen people
Pilate told the Jews that he could not find anything wrong with Jesus , but they would not listen to him, and their voices overcame him
As a result, the people of Israel were divided, persecuted by the Roman Empire, and scattered throughout the earth
As we have seen, the center of the prophecies in chapters nine through eleven is Christ as the rejected Messiah
In this message we will consider the prophecy of encouragement regarding Israel's destiny in the great war of Armageddon
Declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him'
As the very God, He has ruled over the entire human race, managing the world situation age after age for thousands of years
In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said clearly that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit
Very few among the human race today know that God is a Spirit and that we have been created by God with a spirit
Neither can we realize Him by our mentality, by our mind, for this is not the proper organ to use in contacting God
Thank God that in His creation He made three crucial, equally important matters the heavens, the earth, and our spirit
Zechariah is a book unveiling Christ as God's center and circumference, yet this Christ is intimately involved with human history
In reading the book of Zechariah and in contacting the Christ revealed in this book, we must first know that we have a spirit
Although this war will be motivated by Antichrist, it will be waged by Satan through his human followers against God with His saints
Eventually, at the great war of Armageddon, there will be two armies Satan's earthly army and God's heavenly army
The war of Armageddon will be fought by Antichrist with his followers directly against Christ with His overcomers
Antichrist the embodiment of Satan will be the commander of Satans army and Christ the embodiment of God will be the Commander of Gods army
In this divine war Christ will destroy Antichrist by the breath of His mouth and bring him to nothing by the manifestation of His coming
Half of the city of Jerusalem will be brought into captivity, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city
Jerusalem will need divine protection not only against Antichrist and his armies but also against Satan and his demons and evil spirits
We may not know how God will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling and a burdensome stone, but we know that He will do this
Their flesh will rot while they are standing on their feet; their eyes will rot in their sockets; and their tongue will rot in their mouth
A great panic from Jehovah will be among them and each will seize his neighbors hand and his hand will rise up against his neighbors hand
The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together, gold and silver and garments in great abundance
The same plague will be on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey, and all the cattle that are in those camps
The feet of Jehovah as Christ will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east
It may be that this household salvation of Israel will take place while the great war of Armageddon is about to end
The Spirit of grace in Zechariah 12:10 is a sweet term, and is in contrast to the Spirit of power in Acts 1:8 and 2:1-4
The Spirit of power is to strengthen us, but the Spirit of grace is to bring us into the enjoyment of the Triune God
In Acts 2 there was the participation in the divine power through the Holy Spirit, but there was not that much enjoyment of the Triune God
The half which remains will no longer have any taste for human life or for acquiring possessions and high positions
Revelation 1:7a refers to this: 'Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him'
Although it was their forefathers who pierced the Lord Jesus, God counts that as something done by these repentant ones
Repentant Israel will wail over Christ as the only Son of God and will cry bitterly over Him as the firstborn Son of God
In the New Testament Christ is revealed first as the only begotten Son of God and then as the firstborn Son of God
According to the New Testament, Christ's being the only begotten Son is for us to be redeemed and to receive eternal life
In their repentance Israel will recognize Christ both as the only begotten Son of God and as the firstborn Son of God
We have three kinds of families: the royal family of David, the family of the priesthood , and the family of an evil man
We come now to Zechariah 13, a chapter on the divine provision and the sovereign preparation for the household salvation of Israel
God has provided the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem with an opened fountain for sin and for impurity
In that day there will be an opened fountain for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity'
God will cut off the names of the idols and will cause the false prophets and the unclean spirit to pass from the land
Christ, the Fellow of Jehovah, came as the God-sent Shepherd to the children of Israel but was attacked unto death by them
Zechariah 13:7a says, 'Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, / And against the man who is My Fellow, / Declares Jehovah of hosts
He was in a situation where His relatives were against Him and where God, to whom He is a Fellow, was also against Him
Immediately after He established the table, He told His disciples that He would be attacked and that they, the sheep, would be scattered
In Zechariah 13:7b through 9 we see God's sovereign preparation of a people to receive the Redeemer with His salvation
In His household salvation for Israel, God has provided not only redemption but also a people to receive His redemption
70 and scattering them into the nations to be despised, humiliated, persecuted, and destroyed throughout the age of grace until today
The center of the prophecies in chapters twelve through fourteen is Christ as the rejected Messiah coming back to be enthroned
In the millennium Jehovah as Christ will be King over all the earth, and He will be the one God and His name the one name
Those who do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles will not receive rain
Christ as the Shoot for the building of the temple of God will bear majesty and will sit and rule on His throne as a Priest and as a King
At the end of this age, Christ will come to stand on the Mount of Olives and will fight with the nations that besiege Jerusalem
The Christ unveiled in Zechariah, the pierced One with whom there is the open fountain, is the centrality and universality of God's economy
As such a One, He is intimately involved with human history, in particular with the Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire
The major point in the Bible concerns God's economy, yet in Christianity today nearly no one talks about God's economy
Throughout the centuries, the Lord has been continually working through those who love Him to recover the lost truths
Martin Luther was strong concerning justification by faith, a basic item, but not concerning the church practice
Later, in the nineteenth century, God used the Brethren to recover the practice of the church life in a much fuller way
According to His eternal arrangement, or economy, God desires to have the church, a proper church in the biblical sense
Very few, even among the co-workers, are qualified to give a message on God's economy with the divine dispensing
We need to be brought into another realm, not the so-called spiritual realm but the realm of God's economy, God's dispensing
The book of Zechariah reveals that Christ is wonderful and that He is the centrality and universality of God's economy
Whereas Zechariah 12:1 speaks of God's forming the human spirit, Isaiah 42:5 simply speaks of God's giving a spirit to man
God has given us a spirit so that we can receive, partake of, participate in, and enjoy Christ as the covenant and as the light
The Lord Jesus replied, 'An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father
An hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness
In His word to the Samaritan woman, the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, 'Woman, you do not know what it is to worship God
A Lamb standing as having just been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth
The Lamb here, who is the stone in Zechariah 3:9, is Christ, and the seven eyes are the sevenfold intensified Spirit
In the first part of this book , there are five visions concerning Christ, and in the last part , many details concerning Christ
As indicated in 3:9, upon this stone are seven eyes, signifying the seven Spirits, that is, the sevenfold intensified Spirit
The lampstand here signifies the nation of Israel as the collective testimony of God shining out all His virtues
In His first coming, Christ came as a lowly King and was temporarily welcomed as the King into Jerusalem in a lowly form
He is righteous and bears salvation; / Lowly and riding upon a donkey, / Even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey'
Jehovah will be King over all the earth; and in that day Jehovah will be the one God and His name the one name'
The vision of the flying scroll , the vision of the ephah vessel , and the vision of the four chariots are visions of judgment
Christ's judgment will be carried out by the four chariots which come forth from between two mountains of brass
Swearing falsely by Jehovah's name signifies sins toward God, which are the issue of a wrong relationship with God
He, the last Craftsman, will come as the stone cut out without hands and smash this great image from the toes to the head
He will clear away from the earth all stealing, all false swearing by Jehovah's name, and all of human government
We should be careful not to steal from others in any way, and we should also be careful to be honest and faithful with God
