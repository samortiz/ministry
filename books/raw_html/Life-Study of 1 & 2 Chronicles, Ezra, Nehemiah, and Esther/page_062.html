<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF ESTHER</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE OPEN SALVATION<br />
OF THE HIDING GOD IN SECRECY<br />
TO HIS PERSECUTED ELECT IN THEIR CAPTIVITY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Esth. 3&mdash;10</h1>
<p>In this message we will cover chapters three through ten.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE OPEN SALVATION<br />
OF THE HIDING GOD IN SECRECY<br />
TO HIS PERSECUTED ELECT IN THEIR CAPTIVITY<br />
AS SEEN IN MORDECAI</h2>
<p>These chapters are concerned with the open salvation of the hiding God in secrecy to His persecuted elect in their captivity as seen in Mordecai.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Haman&rsquo;s Plot<br />
to Destroy All the Jews in Medo-Persia</h2>
<p>In chapter three we see Haman&rsquo;s plot to destroy all the Jews in Medo-Persia.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. An Agagite by the Name of Haman<br />
Being Promoted to the Highest Seat<br />
above All the Princes Who Were with the King</h2>
<p>The Agagites were enemies of God. God charged Saul to slay all the Agagites, but he failed to do this and thereby offended God.</p>
<p>An Agagite by the name of Haman was promoted (no doubt at the instigation of Satan, the adversary of God) to the highest seat above all the princes who were with the king. The king commanded all his servants to bow down and pay homage to Haman, but Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage because of his Jewish belief in the unique God (vv. 1-4). He believed in one God and refused to bow down to anyone other than God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Haman Being Filled with Rage<br />
and Plotting Not Only to Kill Mordecai but Also<br />
to Destroy All the Jews throughout the Empire</h2>
<p>Haman was filled with rage and plotted not only to kill Mordecai, the one who refused to pay him homage, but also to destroy all the Jews throughout the empire. He had the king send a decree to each province of his empire to destroy all the Jews, both young and old, children and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, and to plunder their spoil (vv. 5-15). Haman&rsquo;s evil intention was to destroy all the Jews and to take away their wealth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Mordecai&rsquo;s Confrontation<br />
of Haman&rsquo;s Plot through Esther&rsquo;s Close<br />
and Intimate Contact with the King</h2>
<p>In 4:1 through 8:2 we have an account of Mordecai&rsquo;s confrontation of Haman&rsquo;s plot through Esther&rsquo;s close and intimate contact with the king.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. All the Jews and Esther Fasting</h2>
<p>When all the Jews and Esther heard of what Haman intended to do and learned that the king had even issued a decree to carry out Haman&rsquo;s intention, they fasted (4:3, 16). Although they fasted for their supplication to God, contrary to what we would expect, in verse 16 there is no mention of the name of God. While Esther and all the Jews were fasting, Haman, under the plot with his wife and friends, made a gallows on which to hang Mordecai (5:9-14).</p>
