   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE SOURCE OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Faith has a source.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This source is not in the saints but in God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the source of faith were in the saints, faith would be fragile.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Who could have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many children of God sadly sigh over their lack of great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some lack not only great faith but even small faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We often acknowledge that we have no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We wish for greater faith so that we can trust God and He can perform daily miracles for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We wish for practical faith so that we can commit everything into the hand of God with ease and calmness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If only we could have greater faith, everything would be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is our wish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If only we could have faith like So-and-so, then everything would be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is our word of admiration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How often have we asked the Lord to increase our faith?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But why do we still lack faith?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Does faith only belong to a certain privileged class of saints?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Is there truly no way for us to obtain greater faith?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a way in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But only those who want faith can obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The cry of the saints today is for greater faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But where does greater faith come from?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The saints aspire to have greater faith in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is this a mistake?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yes, the mistake of saints is that they want to have greater faith in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They seek faith from the wrong source.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No wonder they never get it!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all ask ourselves, Do I have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Can I trust God regarding this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Is my faith sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The answers to these questions are always No and I cannot !</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What a great grief it is!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not ask these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not the source of faith, so we cannot expect ourselves to have greater faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we ask ourselves and search, seek, and look within ourselves, the more we feel we have no faith or very little faith!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason is that we are not the source of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the source of faith is not within us, we cannot obtain faith if we turn within ourselves to search for it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we must learn a lesson: we are not the source of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we examine ourselves, we cannot see or feel that we have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Word of God tells us what the source of faith really is: Faith...not of yourselves; it is the gift of God Eph 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This verse of the Bible is more than clear; faith is given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A similar word is found in Acts 3:16: The faith which is through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we know that the source of faith is in God, not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This may seem very common, ordinary, and familiar to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But there are not many who really understand the importance of the source of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we really understood that God is the source of our faith, we would never ask ourselves, Do I have enough faith?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do I have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These questions indicate that we still do not understand that God is the source of our faith, because if we did, we would not ask these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God is the Giver of faith; God is the source of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, the fact that God is the source of faith does not mean merely that He gives faith to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It means that men have faith or increase in faith through God because God is the source of their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In other words, men have faith or increase in faith because God possesses a nature that makes it easy for men to trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It means that we do not have to ask, Do we have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is our faith sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These are not the most important questions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These questions will keep us in darkness and discouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should ask, Is God reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Is God honest?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Is God trustworthy?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Will God break His promises?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Are God s power and love real?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because we always pay attention to ourselves, the more we search, the more we are unable to find our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we pay attention to God, we will find that faith comes spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Faith does not originate in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No wonder faith cannot be found when we examine ourselves!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Faith originates with God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more we look at God, look to God, and meditate on God, the more we will have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>An illustration may help us understand this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once a few brothers came to talk with me about the issue of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They felt that they had too little faith.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But I told them that it was not their faith that was too little, but their God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If they wanted to have greater faith, they needed to have a greater God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That day I told them that faith means committing ourselves and our things to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Believing in God means committing ourselves and our things to God and trusting in Him to accomplish these things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I asked, When you commit your things to somebody else, do you ask, Do I have the faith to trust this person?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Is my faith sufficient to trust him?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You never ask these kinds of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Rather, you ask, Can I trust him?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You do not ask, Do I have faith in him?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Suppose you are an owner of a store, and you hire a manager and commit your business entirely to him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When you hired him, you did not ask, Do I have faith in him?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Is my faith too little?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do I have to increase my faith in him?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Instead, you asked yourself, Can I trust him?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Is he honest?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Is he faithful?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Is he reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Since he was honest, trustworthy, and reliable, you spontaneously committed your entire business into his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You did not have to ask yourself if you had faith or if your faith was great or sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Similarly you should trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>You do not have to ask, Do I have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Is my faith great and sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>How much more should my faith be increased?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>All you have to ask is, Is God honest?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Is God faithful?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Is God reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Will God regret His promise and break His word?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If God is honest, faithful, and reliable, and if He promises and will not repent, then you do not have to search and examine yourselves to see if you have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>You will spontaneously commit yourselves and your things to the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Faith is not something produced from within.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It is a trust that arises out of the fact that the other party is honest, stable, trustworthy, and reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Therefore, what is lacking is not greater faith but a greater God.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Most of the time, we do not dare commit ourselves and our things to God under the pretext that our faith is too small.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Actually, the reason we do not dare commit ourselves to God is neither the absence of our faith nor the smallness of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Rather, we think that God is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If God is faithful, why do we not rely on Him?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If God is trustworthy, why do we not put our trust in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If God is reliable, why do we not depend on Him?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If God will not break His word, why do we not rely on Him according to His promise?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We are afraid that our God is muddle-headed, unreliable, dishonest, and always breaking His promises.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is the reason we do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Now is the time for us to confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We know a bank is honest and reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is why we deposit our money in it.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We ask if the bank is trustworthy; we do not ask if we have faith in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>When a baby is in danger, his fear ceases and he is at peace when he just touches his father s hand or mother s face.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>He will not trust anyone else because they are not trustworthy to him.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>He trusts in his parents because they are trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Faith is natural!</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>It comes spontaneously and without reluctance because we put our trust only in those that we consider trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We do not need greater faith, we need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>If we realized that God was the source of our faith, we would no longer seek faith in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Instead, we would lift up our eyes to God and seek to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>When we realize that God is reliable, our faith will spontaneously grow.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>If we know that God is reliable, we will trust Him.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>If we consider God to be unreliable, we will not trust Him.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Our faith has a basis because it rests in God.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We do not believe in ourselves but in God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>We must make a distinction: what we believe in is not our faith but God.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The mistake of some believers is that they believe in their feelings of faith more than they believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>If they feel they have no faith, they do not trust in God or commit their things into God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>If they feel they have faith, they boldly entrust their things to God.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>This is not believing in God.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>This is believing in their own faith!</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>We should not pay much attention to this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>We should not ask or search to see if we have faith, and we should not trust in God only when we have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We should ask whether or not God is reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>If He is and of course He is then why do we not trust in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>If we think, I am not afraid now because I have faith, then we are trusting in our own faith and not trusting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Likewise, if we say, I cannot commit these things to God because I have no faith, it does not mean that we do not believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>This only indicates that we doubt our own faith.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>We fail to trust in God not because He is untrustworthy but because we do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>The problem is not with God.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>The problem is with man.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>It may be true that you do not have faith, but is God unreliable?</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>If God is reliable, why do you not trust in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>You only have to be concerned about God, not yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>If God is trustworthy, then spontaneously you will trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Otherwise, even if you have faith, it is futile.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Do not trust in your own faith; your faith is not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>Instead, trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>For I know whom I have believed ; therefore, I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit 2 Tim 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>The Bible not only tells us that God is the source of our faith; it also tells us that the word of God is the source of our faith: So faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ Rom 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Why do I first say that God is the source of our faith and then say that the word of God is the source of our faith?</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Here we see the wonder of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>How do we know God?</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>We know Him by the word He speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>The word He speaks represents His heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>When we understand His word, we will realize what God has promised for us and what He does and does not want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Only through the Word of God the Bible can we know God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>When we know His promise, we will trust in Him according to His promise and beseech Him through prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>If we do not have the word of God, we will have nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>And how shall they believe into Him of whom they have not heard?</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>Rom 10:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>If we do not have the promise of God, but mindlessly believe in Him, we will fall into a kind of superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>Faith must be based on something.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>Mindlessly believing, without a basis, is superstition, and no one will receive anything from this kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>If my father promises me something, I believe he will give it to me.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>This believing is solid because my faith is based on the promise of my father.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>If my father has not promised me anything, but I force myself to believe that he will give me something, then I am not believing but dreaming because I believe in something that is not factual but my own imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>From this example, we can see the important relationship between faith and promise.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>God s promises are only recorded in God s Word, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>To know the promises of God, one must know the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>Without the promises of God, our faith is not real faith.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>The promises are in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>So faith comes...through the word of Christ Rom 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>We have said that we need to believe in God s faithfulness, trustworthiness, and reliability.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>We have also said that if we know God, we will spontaneously have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>This is related to God s promises, that is, to His words.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>If God has not promised anything, how can we know that He is faithful?</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>He must promise something before we can talk about His faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>Faith is holding on to what God has said and praying for God s work to be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>Faith is believing that God will do what He has said.</S>
   <S PAR='190' RSNT='1' SNO='190'>Faith is believing that God is faithful and that He will work out what He has said.</S>
   <S PAR='191' RSNT='1' SNO='191'>Whether our faith is great or small is not the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='192' RSNT='1' SNO='192'>The issue is: if God has promised something, will He lie and change?</S>
   <S PAR='193' RSNT='1' SNO='193'>The only question we should ask is whether or not we believe that God is honest.</S>
   <S PAR='194' RSNT='1' SNO='194'>This has nothing to do with our faith being great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='195' RSNT='1' SNO='195'>We know that God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='196' RSNT='1' SNO='196'>Therefore, we should have no doubt that He is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='197' RSNT='1' SNO='197'>The Bible shows us at least two aspects concerning His promises: What He has promised He is able also to do Rom 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='198' RSNT='1' SNO='198'>God is powerful and His power fulfills His promises.</S>
   <S PAR='199' RSNT='1' SNO='199'>Our God is not a weak and powerless God who cannot do what He says He will do.</S>
   <S PAR='200' RSNT='1' SNO='200'>If this were so, what good would His promises be?</S>
   <S PAR='201' RSNT='1' SNO='201'>All of His promises would be empty words.</S>
   <S PAR='202' RSNT='1' SNO='202'>But God is not only powerful in promising something, He is also powerful in carrying out His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='203' RSNT='1' SNO='203'>Whatever He has promised, He is able to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='204' RSNT='1' SNO='204'>He is able this is what the Bible tells us about His person.</S>
   <S PAR='205' RSNT='1' SNO='205'>For the Lord is able to make him stand Rom 14:4 .</S>
