<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. FOR CHRIST TO BE THE KING</H2><P>Jehovah's destruction of the nations is for Christ to be the King. After all the "hired" people and kings were fired, there is another King, Christ (32:1). God hired us to be kings, but we did not do very well; therefore, we were fired that Christ could be the King as our replacement.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A King Reigning according to Righteousness</H2><P>Since everyone has been fired, who will be the king? Christ will be the King, and many of those who love Him will be the rulers. Concerning this, 32:1 says, "Behold, a King will reign according to righteousness,/And the rulers will rule according to justice."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. A Man Being Like a Refuge from the Wind</H2><P>Isaiah 32:2 says, "A man will be like a refuge from the wind/And a covering from the tempest,/Like streams of water in a dry place,/Like the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land." Here we see that Christ will also be a man who is a refuge from the wind, a covering from the tempest, like streams of water in a dry place, and like the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land. On the one hand, Christ will be the King ruling; on the other hand, He will be a man overshadowing. Under Him there will be righteousness, protection, and enjoyment. This is a picture of the millennial kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. TO BRING IN THE RESTORATION FOR ISRAEL</H2><P>As the King, Christ will bring in the restoration for Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Eyes of Those Who See Not Being Dim</H2><P>The eyes of those who see will not be dim, and the ears of those who hear will attend. The heart of the hasty will understand knowledge, and the tongue of those who stammer will hasten to speak elegantly (32:3-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Spirit Being Poured<br>upon Them from on High,<br>and the Wilderness Becoming a Fruitful Field</H2><P>The Spirit will be poured upon them from on high, and the wilderness will become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be considered to be a forest (32:15). Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness will remain in the fruitful field. The work of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness will be quietness and assurance forever. Jehovah's people will live in a peaceful habitation and in secure dwellings and carefree resting places (vv. 16-18). This indicates that when Christ rules over the earth, righteousness will be there. This righteousness will work out peace, quietness, and assurance (or trust). Righteousness under Christ's reign will be our security. Thus, there will be a peaceful habitation.</P>
