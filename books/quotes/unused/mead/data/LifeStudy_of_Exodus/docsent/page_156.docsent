   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JEHOVAH HAVING WAR WITH AMALEK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God also determined to have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In many places in the Old Testament we see that God s people fought against Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We see this in Judges 3:13-15; 5:14; 6:3; 7:12-14; 1 Samuel 15:2-9, 32-33; 27:8; 30:1-17; 2 Samuel 8:12; 1 Chronicles 4:42-43.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We see the war with Amalek even in the book of Esther 3:1-6; 9:7-10 , where we are told that Haman was an Agagite, a descendant of Agag, the king of Amalek who was cut in pieces by Samuel 1 Sam 15:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although Agag was slain, certain of his descendants survived.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Haman was a late descendant of Agag.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God hates the flesh signified by Haman.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the book of Esther, the flesh works in a hidden way to undermine God s people and even to kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today Haman, the flesh, tries to work in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Haman s plot to annihilate the children of Israel was eventually exposed and thwarted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Esther was exercised to deal with Haman, the hidden flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through her help, Haman was put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus we see that the book of Esther is a story of God s war with Amalek, the continuation of the warfare with Amalek from generation to generation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>HOW TO FIGHT AGAINST AMALEK A. By Praying with the Interceding Christ</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We come now to the important matter of how to fight against Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the first place, we fight by praying with the interceding Christ Exo 17:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moses lifting up his hand on the mountaintop typifies the interceding Christ in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are told in 17:12 that when Moses hands were heavy, Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the significance of this?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have pointed out that Moses here is a type of Christ interceding for us in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But we cannot say that Christ s hands are heavy, can we?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Surely Christ does not need anyone to stay up His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no Aaron or Hur in the heavens helping Christ with His intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It seems, then, that the type is not altogether fitting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, since the Bible was inspired by God, there must be something here related to our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we consider these verses in the light of our experience, we shall understand that to deal with the flesh we not only need Christ s intercession for us in the heavens, but we ourselves also need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some Christian teachers emphasize the objective work of Christ in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They point out that Christ is in the heavens now interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Others devote a great deal of attention to the importance of fasting and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If one is troubled by the flesh in a certain aspect, they would advise him to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For our experience we need both the objective aspect and the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we have pointed out, Moses praying on the mountaintop typifies Christ interceding for us in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the fact that Moses needed Aaron and Hur to stay up his hands signifies our need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While Christ is praying in the heavens, we must pray here on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we pray, we are one with Moses on the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when we put the flesh to death, we are one with Joshua fighting in the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although the interceding Christ does not need anyone to support His hands, we need our praying hands to be stayed up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is easy for them to become heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We know that to deal with the flesh we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But often our hands become heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, we need the help of Aaron and Hur.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Aaron, the high priest, signifies the priesthood, and Hur, who was of the tribe of Judah, signifies the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The grandson of Hur, Bezaleel, was given the ability to work on the fixtures for the tabernacle 31:2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we shall see when we consider the later chapters of Exodus, the tabernacle, God s building, was constructed by the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our prayer needs to be sustained by the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes our praying hands become heavy not because we lack the desire to pray, but because we are lacking in incentive and encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that we may be in need of Aaron and Hur, in need of the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The priesthood is related to the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In our experience, the Holy of Holies is always related to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, to be heavy in prayer indicates a problem or shortage in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For some reason, our spirit is not keen, active, or positive with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This causes our prayer to become heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our experience confirms this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At such times of heaviness, we should not deal with our prayer by trying to pray more.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Instead, we should deal with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In our spirit there is the shortage of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need Aaron, the high priest, to strengthen our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Another reason for heaviness in prayer is rebellion against the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you say that you are not rebellious, then I would inquire about the matter of disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Can you say that you are never disobedient toward the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For example, a sister may sense a restraining of the Lord keeping her from going to a department store, but she may disobey this restraint and go anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the course of a single day we may disobey the Lord many times.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We go against the authority, the kingship, within us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, due to the shortage of the kingship, we easily become heavy in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our prayer also becomes heavy when we do not care for the building up of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hur is related to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In fact, the direction of the book of Exodus is toward the building of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have pointed out that Bezaleel, the grandson of Hur, was granted the gift by God to become skilled in working on various aspects of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This indicates that our prayer needs to be with a view to the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What God is doing today is toward this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If our prayer life does not have in view the building of the church, our prayer will not last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But if we have the priesthood and the kingship and care for the building up of the tabernacle, the church, our prayer life will not become heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Rather, it will be supported by the priesthood and the kingship, and it will have the building of the church in view.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then we shall be able to fight against the flesh, Amalek, by means of our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In our prayer we should be one with Christ in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to join Christ and be one with Him in His intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should make His prayer our prayer, His intercession our instant prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Supported by the priesthood and the kingship, that is, stirred up in our spirit and subdued under God s authority, we need to pray with Him on the throne in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Furthermore, the direction of our prayer must be toward the goal of the building of God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we have these factors the priesthood, the kingship, and God s building in view I do not believe our prayer can be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The picture of Aaron and Hur holding up Moses hands is a portrait of the union in prayer between Christ and us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When Christ intercedes, we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We join with Him in His intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the proper way for us to pray in dealing with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Dealing with the flesh is not a shallow matter, for our entire fallen being is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In a sense, the flesh is just we ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To deal with the flesh is much more difficult than to deal with the world or with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In order to deal with the totality of our fallen being, we need much prayer in union with the intercession of the heavenly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>To pray in this way, we must be identified with Christ and one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As He prays in the heavens, we pray together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we would pray in this way, we need to be stirred in our spirit by the priesthood and subdued by the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We also need to care for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Then we shall have the necessary support to sustain our prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In 17:12 we are told that Aaron and Hur took a stone and put it under Moses, and he sat on it.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This indicates that our prayer life must have a solid base.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When I was young, I learned to pray, but my prayer did not have a solid base.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is also true of many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>They have learned to pray, but they lack a solid base for their prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I do not believe that, according to the context of Exodus 17, the strong base for our prayer life is Christ directly.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Instead, I believe that the stone used as the strong base refers to our realization that in ourselves we are not able to sustain a prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It is the recognition of the fact that we need support.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In our natural life we, like Moses, are not able to persevere in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We simply cannot continue our prayer all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Thus, we need to realize our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This realization gives us the strong base we need for our prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When you are about to pray, you need to realize that in yourself you are not able to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Every praying person can testify that it is not possible to have a prayer life without a strong base.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We need something solid to uphold our life of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Whenever you pray, tell the Lord, Lord, I am not able to continue in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I need a solid base for my prayer, and I take You as such a base.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We are told that Moses prayed until sunset.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We may have a good time of prayer early in the morning, but we usually cannot continue until noon, much less until the end of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Are you able to keep yourself in the spirit of prayer from early morning until noon?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Probably few among us are able to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Moses was able to pray until sunset because he had a rock, a solid base, to sit on, and because he had Aaron and Hur supporting him.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Be encouraged to tell the Lord, Lord, I am not able to pray without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>It is easy for me to lose my temper or to gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>But I cannot pray continually.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Lord, I can pray for a short time, but I can t pray all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>If you say this to the Lord, you will find that you are sitting on a rock.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>You will then have a solid base for your prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>I am burdened to share this point because I realize that one of the biggest problems we face is that of our prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If we want our prayer life to be preserved, we need to take care of four matters: the solid base, the priesthood, the kingship, and the building of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Then our prayer life will be upheld.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Verse 11 says, And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>This indicates that whenever our prayer life becomes heavy, our flesh will prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We know this from our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Only a proper prayer life can defeat our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Do not think that because you have been saved a long time and have had certain spiritual experiences, your flesh can no longer become prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>It is a fact that if our prayer ceases, our flesh will spontaneously show itself to be the same as that of unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>No matter how rich our spiritual experience may be, this experience will not cause our flesh to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Our flesh will not even be influenced by it.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>The flesh cannot be influenced, changed, or improved, even after you have been a Christian for many decades.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>If your prayer ceases, your flesh will be the same today as it was before you were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Because the flesh does not change or improve, we need to pray without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>We have seen that genuine prayer causes us to be identified with the heavenly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>The experience of identification with Christ in the heavens takes place through a proper prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Whenever we pray in a genuine way, we enjoy a heavenly union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>This prayer, however, depends on a solid base, on the priesthood, the kingship, and the goal of God s building.</S>
