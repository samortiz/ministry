   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai TAKING CARE OF ONE'S STANDING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN CONTACTING THE SAINTS Being Based on Spiritual Relationships Only</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chang Kwang-yung: How should we take care of the many problems in coordination?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we work in different local churches, what are the things that we should take care of?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Watchman Nee: There are a few things that a worker should pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first thing is his standing in contacting the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a worker goes to a new place, he should pay attention to his relationship with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many times, the relationship between the co-workers and the other saints is not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The degree of intimacy in fellowship can only be determined by spiritual factors.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The workers who are too strong or too weak dispositionally need special help.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rejecting Any Friendship</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to be delivered from relationships of friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Friendship probably is related to sameness in disposition or compatibility in position.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some co-workers are closer to some saints because they like each other dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some workers are burdened for some brothers and sisters because they have similar weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, their friendship becomes more intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But this kind of relationship will not render anyone any help.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the end no brother or sister will receive deliverance through this kind of friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The co-workers have to cut off all relationships of friendship with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our relationship is a spiritual one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not related because we are similar in our disposition, because we are from the same school, or because we were born in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not Falling into Others' Weaknesses</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we fellowship with a weak brother, we have to help him instead of falling into the same situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to pull him up to another level.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is where the problem lies between our Brother Leland Wang and Brother Chang Chi-chen in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>LEARNING TO BE LED AWAY TO THE LOWLY Keeping a Distance from the Rich Ones</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second point to pay attention to is to learn to be led away to the lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to be careful about people who are famous and who occupy high positions in society.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should keep a distance from them, lest we fall into suspicion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not everyone can go into the home of a rich brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes one has to go through the doorkeepers in order to visit such brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not live in the houses of the rich ones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not a good thing for today's Christianity to be mixed up with great capitalists.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once I was in Chefoo, and the brothers invited me to stay at the house of a well-to-do brother because of my sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I declined the offer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They asked me for the reason, and I told them that it has to do with my footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On another occasion I went to Kaifeng to conduct some meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first few days I stayed at a rich person's home.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later, I decided not to stay in the house of that government officer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who love to acquaint themselves with rich and influential people have lost their standing as a worker of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have no patience for these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such ones have lost their standing in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our standing is that of a worker of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every worker should maintain his ministerial standard.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Both the Lord and the apostles rebuked the rich and the influential ones more severely and sharply than others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not take care of the issue of money properly, we will leave a bad taste with others.</S>
