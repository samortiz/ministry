   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A NEW HEART AND A NEW SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The cleansing mentioned above is something on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the positive side, after the cleansing, the Lord gives us a new heart and a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many of you have been Christians for years, but you have never heard a message telling you that you have a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one told you that at the time of your conversion, the Lord gave you not only a new heart but also a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Loving the Lord with Our Heart</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to realize that there is a difference between the heart and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our heart is an organ of love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once I gave a message in which I pointed out that it is not enough just to have a loving heart toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A particular sister was troubled by this and wanted to know what I meant by saying that we need something more than a loving heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To illustrate, I asked her if she loved a certain Bible which belonged to her husband and if she would like to have it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then I said, The Bible is yours; please take it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When she stretched out her hand to take the Bible, I said, Do not use your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just use your loving heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Take the Bible with your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through this illustration she came to understand that having a loving heart is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She also needed to stretch forth her hand to take the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In like manner, we need both a heart to love the Lord and a spirit to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Receiving the Lord with Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We love the Lord with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The heart is the loving organ, but it is not the receiving organ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to take or receive anything we must use the proper organ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we would contact the Lord, receive the Lord, enjoy the Lord, eat the Lord, and drink the Lord, we need a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whereas we love the Lord with our heart, we contact the Lord and receive the Lord with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, we need to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that we have an appetite for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we have no love for the Lord and no appetite for Him, we will not come to Him or receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before we were saved, we did not love the Lord and we did not have any appetite for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, our taste was for the world and for the things of the world, especially worldly amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When others spoke to us about the Lord Jesus, we did not care to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We had no interest because we had no appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We loved other things, and our heart was set on those things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, one day the Lord granted us His gracious visitation, and immediately our appetite was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We began to love the Lord and the Bible, and we lost our appetite for the worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the Lord s gracious doing, and it caused our heart to turn from the world to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to love the Lord Jesus and have an appetite for Him that will turn us from the appetite for other things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should be able to tell the Lord Jesus that we love Him and that we are hungry and thirsty for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once we have acquired such a loving appetite for the Lord, we need to use our spirit as the organ to contact Him, receive Him, eat Him, drink Him, and breathe Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we can see that we need two organs: a loving heart and a receiving spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The receiving spirit has been greatly neglected by many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In some places messages stir up people s loving heart but give them no help to exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We thank the Lord that He has given us not only a new heart to love Him but also a new spirit to contact Him, receive Him, and contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A Soft Heart</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The new heart which the Lord has given us is very soft.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead of a stiff, hard, and stony heart, we now have a heart of flesh, a heart that is soft toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before we were saved, we could do many sinful things without any feeling of regret.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because our heart was hardened and stiff, we had no inner sense toward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But when we were saved, our heart was changed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now we have a softened heart.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, we may speak only part of a sentence and sense that we are wrong and that we should not have said anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Immediately we stop speaking and perhaps even apologize for what we have spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At other times because our heart is soft, we may be troubled by even a small mistake or by a slight impurity in our motive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This proves that we have been converted and revived, that we have turned to the Lord, and that our heart has become soft and sensitive.</S>
