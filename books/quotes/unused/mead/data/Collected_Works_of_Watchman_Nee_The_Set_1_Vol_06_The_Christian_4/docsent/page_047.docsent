   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPIRITUAL TEACHINGS MESSAGE ONE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION Talks to Young Christians Issue No. 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every time I go to a place to preach God's gospel of grace, I always ask the local Christians one question.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe all those who can answer me with a clear "yes" are joyfully enjoying the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The question is, "Are you already saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, do you really know that you are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among a thousand people, one can only find two or three who know that they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes, among a whole congregation, one cannot find one person who knows that he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then I ask these ones, "You have received the Lord Jesus and have accepted Him as your personal Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have trusted in the blood of His cross to wash away your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why do you still not know that you are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a man falls into the water, and another man pulls him out, after the first man comes to his senses, he will surely know whether he is still in the water or safe on the shore.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You should know whether you are a perishing man or a saved man who has obtained God's grace."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many people would not respond clearly with words, but their answer always seems to be, "I do not know if I have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How can I say that I am saved while I am still living on earth?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I think many of the readers of this message would answer this way!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is exactly where our mistake lies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our belief in the Lord Jesus is not like gambling, winning when we are lucky and losing when we are not lucky.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The salvation that comes through believing in the cross of the Lord Jesus is fully guaranteed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not have to wait until we die before we can know if we are saved or not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can know this now.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the clear teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Please read a few verses:</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Therefore let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you; and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified" Acts 13:38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot obtain justification by God through our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have many sins, which make our heart sad whenever we think about them and cause us to think that we are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But although we can fail, the Lord Jesus is still trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we believe in Him, our sins will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All those who believe in Him will be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How great is the Lord's salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's Word says, "Let it be known to you."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should know what?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should know that once we have believed in the Lord Jesus, our sins are forgiven, and we are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are saved!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When God says, "Let it be known to you," we can know if we are saved or not.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not refuse Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should commit our sins to the Savior and believe in His accomplished salvation for us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will then be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"This is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God" 1 John 5:9-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He who has the Lord Jesus has life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He who does not have Him does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Have you accepted the Lord Jesus as your Savior?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you have, you have life already, and you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus said Himself: "He who believes has eternal life" John 6:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has testified for His Son that He has given to us eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This passage of the Scripture says that if we do not believe in the testimony that we have eternal life, then we are making God a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God says all those who have trusted and accepted the Lord Jesus have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Would God lie?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should believe that we who have been washed by His blood are saved already.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God said, through the apostle John, that He wrote these words that we may know that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The testimony of the Bible is that we can know if we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not something that happens only after we die; we do not have to wait until the coming age before we know.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>While we are living on earth today, we should know if we are saved or not.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are not, we should make haste to believe in Jesus Christ and come to God through trusting in His saving accomplishment for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are saved, we should give much thanks to God's grace and should live on earth like saved persons.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Behold, now is the well-acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation" 2 Cor 6:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God accepts us now and saves us now, rather than after we die.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes, when I ask a person if he is saved, he answers, "I am only trying my best to do good and to serve God, hoping that I can eventually be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Alas, this is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that he does not understand the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do you think that you can be saved in the future by trying your best to do good and to serve God?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to know that none of our merits and works are acceptable before God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>"All our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment" Isa 64:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do you think that merit and work will save you?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No, ten thousand times no!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Bible clearly says, "You have been saved...not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast" Eph 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Salvation comes through trusting in the Lord Jesus, "who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree" 1 Pet 2:24 , "the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God" 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He has accomplished the work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All you have to do is to believe and obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved" Acts 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do not try to be saved by your own work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>No matter how good your works are, they cannot save you, for "you have been saved...not of works" Eph 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you trust in the accomplishment of the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you do not accept the Lord Jesus as the Savior, there will be no hope for your salvation because you cannot save yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you accept the Lord Jesus as the sin offering, you do not have to hope to be saved because you have eternal life already.</S>
