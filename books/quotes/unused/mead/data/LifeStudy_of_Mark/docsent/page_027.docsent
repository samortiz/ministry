   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE NINE THE WAYS THE SLAVE-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CARRIED OUT HIS GOSPEL SERVICE 3 Scripture Reading: Mark 2:18 3:6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Gospel of Mark is not a book of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a biography, this Gospel was written according to the facts of history.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The record of this Gospel, therefore, is according to historical sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>FIVE KEY WORDS Forgiveness</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen that the five incidents recorded in 2:1 3:6 form a group.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These five incidents are the forgiving of the sins of the sick 2:1-12 , feasting with sinners 2:13-17 , causing His followers to be merry without fasting 2:18-22 , caring for His followers hunger rather than for religion s regulation 2:23-28 , and caring for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion 3:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Each of these incidents can be summarized by a particular word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word to summarize the first incident is forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2:1-12 we have a case of the forgiveness of sins by the Son of Man, who was the forgiving God incarnated in the form of a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 2:5 the Lord Jesus said to the paralytic, Child, your sins are forgiven!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the scribes heard this they reasoned in their hearts, He is blaspheming!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Who can forgive sins except one God? v. 7 . Eventually, the Lord said, But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins He says to the paralytic, To you I say, Rise, pick up your bed and go to your house vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Son of Man, even though He was in the form of a Slave, had the authority to forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we have a strong indication that the forgiving God was present in the form of this Man, a man who was a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the first incident in this series of five incidents concerns forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word to describe the second incident is enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this incident, recorded in 2:13-17, the Slave-Savior as a Physician was feasting with sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, here we have the enjoyment of feasting with the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who feasted with Him enjoyed the goodness of the Slave-Savior, who is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, what they actually experienced was the enjoyment of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason, the word enjoyment is a summary of this incident.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Joy</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may use a very simple word to describe the third incident joy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, in the first three incidents we have forgiveness, enjoyment, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to 2:18-22, certain basic factors must exist in order for us to be joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without these factors, we cannot have joy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first basic factor is the Bridegroom: Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast v. 19 . A bridegroom is the most pleasant person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, in chapter two of Mark the basic factor of our joy is the Savior as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Two other factors of joy are the new cloth v. 21 and the new wine v. 22 . The new cloth is for making a garment to cover us and beautify us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unshrunk cloth is cloth that has not yet been treated or worked upon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This new cloth is for making a new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This new garment, which is actually Christ Himself, covers us and beautifies us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The new wine satisfies us and makes us joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Outwardly, we have the new cloth; inwardly, we have the new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, we are with the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now we have these basic factors for us to be joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No philosopher could utter a word like what is spoken by the Lord Jesus in 2:18-22.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In His wisdom the Lord uses ordinary things like cloth and wine to illustrate wonderful points.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord speaks of a bridegroom, new cloth, and new wine to show us how we may be joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can be joyful because we are with the Bridegroom, because we have a new covering to beautify us, and because we have new wine to fill us, satisfy us, and cause us to be beside ourselves with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, in the third incident we have joy.</S>
