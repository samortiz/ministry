   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"O LORD, THOU ART THE SPIRIT"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1963, I began to compile an English hymnal with the help of an American brother, and I wrote a hymn that says, "O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I also wrote another hymn that says, "O Lord, Thou art the Spirit!/How dear and near to me."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1964, I went to New York to lead a conference and training, and this American brother also went.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There was a dissenting brother who, upon seeing this American brother polishing these hymns, said to him, "Don't work on these hymns."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After a few days, I sat down to fellowship with this dissenting brother.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said, "The Bible does say that Christ is the Spirit, but today Christianity cannot accept this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you speak this, you will stir up opposition from Christianity."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then I said, "Brother, my burden today is mainly to speak on Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I do not speak this, I have nothing to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I ask that you and the other brothers give me the liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are afraid of opposition, then what will the Lord's recovery do?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Martin Luther spoke on justification by faith during his time, he was very much opposed by the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Did he stop speaking because he was afraid of people's opposition?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If he did not speak, from where would the Reformation have come?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, the Lord's recovery is still not completed, we cannot stop speaking simply because we are afraid of people's opposition."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE ETERNAL FATHER BEING THE REDEEMER FROM OF OLD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Isaiah 9:6 says, "For a child is born to us,/A son is given to us /And His name will be called/Wonderful Counselor,/Mighty God,/Eternal Father,/Prince of Peace."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These two terms Mighty God and Eternal Father are placed next to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, He is the mighty God; on the other hand, He is the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to read the subsequent portions in Isaiah for an explanation of the term Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To interpret every verse of the Bible, we need the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Isaiah 63:16 says, "For You are our Father, / Since Abraham does not know us,/And Israel does not acknowledge us./You, Jehovah, are our Father;/Our Redeemer from of old is Your name."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here our Father and our Redeemer are put together.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both our Father and our Redeemer are Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jehovah in the Old Testament is Jesus in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Je- refers to Jehovah, and -sus, which was added, means Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jehovah becoming the Savior is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here it says, "You, Jehovah, are our Father;/Our Redeemer from of old is Your name."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This One is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here it does not say, "You, God, are our Father" but "You, Jehovah, are our Father."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This Father is Jehovah our Savior, who is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Could it be that Isaiah was telling us about two Fathers: one Father the eternal Father in 9:6 and another Father Jehovah in 63:16?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is impossible!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Isaiah 64:8 says, "But now, Jehovah, You are our Father."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then 63:16 says, "You, Jehovah, are our Father;/Our Redeemer from of old is Your name."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This implies that Jehovah is our Father from of old.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jehovah being our Father from of old equals His being our eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From of old means from eternity, eternally existing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The eternal Father, the Redeemer, from of old, is the One who is our Father from of old.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then 64:8 says, "But now, Jehovah, You are our Father."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jehovah is our Father from of old, and now He is still our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to what is recorded in the entire book of Isaiah, we can conclude that "Eternal Father" in 9:6 is both Jehovah and Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, 9:6 says that although He is the Son, His name is called Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that He is the Son as well as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a group of opposers near Orange County, California in the United States who studied Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the record of their studies there was a conversation like this: One said, "Isaiah 9:6 surely said that Jesus is the Father!"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Another said, "Yes, but we dare not say so.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we say so, then we contradict the traditional teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These words were all printed in the booklet we wrote in rebuttal.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Up to today, however, at least five or six years have gone by, and they still have not published a book to refute our rebuttal.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is because they have no ground to refute.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The truth is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Isaiah 9:6 there is another proof that the Son is the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This poetic prophecy was written in couplets.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the Hebrew language, couplets are often employed to refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"For a child is born to us, / A son is given to us" is a couplet.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then it goes on to say, "And His name will be called /Mighty God,/Eternal Father."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The child being called Mighty God and the Son being called Eternal Father are also a couplet.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The mighty God is simply Jehovah God; the eternal Father is just another way of saying it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that the mighty God and the eternal Father form a pair poetically.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is to say that the eternal Father is the mighty God, just as the child is the Son and the Son is the child in the previous line.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As to His becoming a man, He is the child who was born of Mary in a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But as to His eternal divinity, He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This One who is the child and the Son is the mighty God and the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since Jesus is the child and the Son, He is the mighty God and the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The infant Jesus who was born in a manger is the mighty God and the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The child and the Son are one; the mighty God and the eternal Father are also one.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whether it be the child, the Son, the mighty God, or the eternal Father, they are all only one Person; they all refer to the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
