   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Choosing the Time or Place</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season 2 Tim 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spirit of the gospel also causes people to preach the gospel in season and out of season without choosing a time or place according to their preference.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>D. L. Moody was in bed one night when he suddenly realized that he had not preached the gospel to anyone that day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He got up, put on his clothes, and went outside to find someone to whom he could preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was no one on the street because it was late at night.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, he looked until he found a night patrolman.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He told the patrolman that he must believe in the Lord Jesus and that if he did not believe, he would go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though the patrolman was very angry after hearing this, he went to find Moody the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moody then preached the gospel to him in more detail, and he believed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moody s willingness to preach the gospel in season and out of season earned him the nickname of Crazy Moody.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not Being Afraid of Sufferings</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God ; Striving together along with the faith of the gospel, and in nothing being frightened by the opposers 2 Tim 1:8; Phil 1:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Preaching the gospel will bring in suffering and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, when we have the spirit of the gospel, the fear of such things will not hinder us from preaching boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Leaving Everything</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel s sake, but that he shall receive Mark 10:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our power in preaching the gospel is based on our ability to leave everything for the Lord and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must do this in order to release the gospel with power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This ability is part of the spirit of the gospel, and it comes from the spirit of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The most important point in preaching the gospel is not how well we can speak; the most important point is whether we have the spirit of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we have the spirit of the gospel, the gospel can be released from us and can enter into others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The spirit of the gospel is the way of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE LIFE OF THE GOSPEL Living Worthily of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ Phil 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition to the spirit of the gospel, we must have a life of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The emphasis of the spirit of the gospel is on power; the emphasis of the life of the gospel is on our living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some have a great measure of the spirit of the gospel, but their life of the gospel is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Their living is not worthy of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our living must be worthy of the gospel that we preach.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If it is not, the gospel will not find a proper outlet in us, even if we have a spirit of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A living that is unworthy of the gospel hinders people from accepting the gospel and from believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Abiding in the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the Lord s word, we must abide in Him if we want to preach the gospel and bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To abide in the Lord is simply to fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we fellowship with the Lord, we can bear much fruit and bring many to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Preaching the gospel does not depend only upon power; it depends also upon life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not fellowship with the Lord and abide in Him, we cannot bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if we bear a little fruit, it will be the fruit of an inferior life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It will not be rich and bountiful, because different kinds of fruit are produced by different kinds life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we have a good life that comes from constant fellowship with the Lord, we will bear good fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Being Pruned</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit John 15:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we want to preach the gospel and bear much fruit, we must be pruned.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This does not refer merely to being pruned of things related to filthiness and sin; it refers even more to being pruned of everything that is not proper before God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God prunes every branch that bears fruit so that it can bear more fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Pruning is not merely a washing but also a cutting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everything that is not proper, everything that hinders the branch from bearing more fruit, must be cut away.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although we need to thoroughly deal with sin in order to eliminate all filthiness, we must also receive God s dealing in order to eliminate everything that hinders us from bearing fruit or from bearing much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Often we cannot bring people to salvation or bring more people to salvation because we have not received enough dealing from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord desires to deal not only with our errors but also with our being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A person who tends trees must prune the tree s branches so that the tree can bear fruit or bear more fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once the branches are pruned, the tree can bear fruit or bear more fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The fact that we have not brought anyone to salvation for a long time or that we have not brought many to salvation proves that we have not allowed the Lord to do a pruning work upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should beseech the Lord to enlighten us and show us the areas that we need to allow Him to prune.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord wants to inwardly enlighten us through the Holy Spirit on the one hand and to outwardly deal with us through our circumstances on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we receive the Lord s enlightenment inwardly and receive His dealing through our circumstances outwardly, we will be able to bring people to salvation or bring more people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A brother who comes to every meeting, reads the Bible, prays, and is irreproachable in his conduct may still not be able to bring anyone to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This does not mean that he has committed some sin; it may mean that he has not allowed the Lord to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since the Lord wants him to bear fruit or more fruit, He may change the brother s circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Perhaps He will cause him to lose his job, become sick, or have difficulties at work or at home.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord will deal with the brother through his circumstances in order to break him so that he can receive the Lord s pruning and cutting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After a new beginning he will be able to bring people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The number of people that we can bring to salvation depends on how much dealing we have received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have fresh power when we receive the Lord s fresh dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we had power last year but not this year, we must receive fresh dealings in order to have fresh power to bear fresh fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to let the Lord prune what needs to be pruned and to break what needs to be broken in order to bear fresh fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must receive the Lord s constant dealing in order to constantly bring people to salvation.</S>
