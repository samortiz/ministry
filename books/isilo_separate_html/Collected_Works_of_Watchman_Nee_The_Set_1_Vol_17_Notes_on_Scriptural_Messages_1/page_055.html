Today I will not speak much about it again. I am not going to cover the whole parable but only point out a few things. I will speak a little here and a little there in a fragmentary way.</P><P>Verses 17 through 19 say, "But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father's hired servants abound in bread, but I am perishing here in famine! I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants." Whenever a sinner becomes repentant through the operation of his environment, he has a certain evaluation concerning his own salvation. If a man does not want to be saved, he will not have any consideration concerning his salvation; he will not care about the matter or be bothered about it. But once he is awakened, he will begin to consider how he can be saved and what are the conditions for one to be saved. If you ask any sinner about the way of salvation, you will find out that he has his own idea of being saved. God has His way of salvation, and a sinner has his way of salvation. I am afraid that with a hundred sinners, there are a hundred different ways of salvation. Everyone has his concept, and everyone has his evaluation. The prodigal son had his way of salvation. He thought that when he saw his father, his father would rebuke him with a stern face, and so he would answer, "The inheritance that you gave me has been spent. I cannot use another penny of yours anymore. But you are a rich man and have many hired servants. Just hire me as you have hired one of your servants." For him, salvation was not to be a son but a slave only!</P><P>A sinner's way of salvation is by giving others what they deserve and receiving back what they deserve. It is by working for others and receiving wages from them. The amount of work one does is the amount of wages one receives. It is by being a slave and not a son.</P><P>Verses 20 through 22 say, "And he rose up and came to his own father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately. And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son. But the father said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet." The prodigal son rose up to come to his father. When he saw the father, he repeated the speech he had planned. He said that he was not worthy to be called his son and was going to say more, "but the father said to his slaves." Hallelujah! "But the father." Salvation is according to God's concept and not according to our concept. No one in the world is saved according to what he thinks but according to what God thinks. The prodigal son's concept was to only be a hired servant. Our thoughts are filled with the law, which is always a question of doing something and receiving something back in return.</P><P>The prodigal son had prepared a speech for his father. But when he saw the father and was touched by his love, the prepared sentence, "Make me like one of your hired servants," did not come out. If we read the whole passage carefully, we will see that he did not say these words because he was interrupted by his father and had no chance; it was not because he did not want to continue speaking. His father had heard enough and did not want to wait for him to finish his words. "But the father said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet."</P><P>Salvation tells us how God wants to treat us, not how we think that God should treat us. According to our concept, we will always be a hired servant. When we remember the Lord, we think of ourselves as sinners, but God considers us as sons. We think that we deserve to perish, but He puts us at the feasting table. We cannot speak enough of God's grace. Even as we repeat it again and again, we are not afraid that it will occupy too much of our mind. We may think that we are not worthy to be called sons, but He has done more than we can imagine. Thank the Lord that salvation is not according to our thoughts or our concepts but according to God's thought.</P><P>While the prodigal was still a long way off, the father saw him and was moved with compassion. The Samaritan saw the man who fell among the robbers on his way to Jericho and was moved with compassion (Luke 10:30-35). What is compassion? Only after a person has fallen into a low estate can compassion be exercised. Compassion is directed downward from above; it is applied in mercy towards someone. If the son had come back in a grand manner, there would have been no way that the father could have shown compassion toward him. How was compassion exercised? When the father saw that the son had degraded into the position of a beggar and actually was a beggar, compassion was exercised. Only a beggar can become a son. Only a beggar standing by the door can sit at the feasting table. Only a beggar far from God can draw nigh to Him. When our condition becomes that of a beggar, God's compassion is moved.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> </body></html>
