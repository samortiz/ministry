Instead, God put man in front of the tree of life and told him to be careful to eat the right thing (Gen. 2:8-9, 16-17). That means that man had to eat the tree of life. Besides the tree of life, there was another tree, the tree of knowledge. Man has to be careful. If he eats the wrong thing, the tree of knowledge, surely he will die (v. 17). It is not a matter of right or wrong, good or bad; it is a matter of life or death. If you eat the right thing, you get life; if you eat the wrong thing, you get death.</P><P>God has no intention to ask you to do something right. The right thing and the wrong thing are in different categories according to our concept. But to God both right and wrong are in the same category. The tree of life is one category and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is another. Thus, God classifies good and evil in the same category. You may think religiously that your good is really good, but God says, "Your good is just as bad as your evil. I never credit your good to your account; I always debit your good to your account just like I debit your evil." Good and evil are not on the credit side, but on the debit side. God has no intention to care for good or evil. God's intention is just to care for life. All that you need is life.</P><P>Let us use a dog as an illustration. Whether this is a good dog or a bad dog, it is still a dog. Whether it is naughty or it behaves, it is still a dog. When it is dirty, it is a dog; when it is clean, it is still a dog. Its life and nature have not changed. In the same way, whether we are good or bad, our life and nature are still the same. This is why we have to give up the religious concept.</P><P>God's intention is that He may come into man as another life to be man's life. God has no intention to ask you to do good, just as He has no intention to ask you to do evil. His intention is just to ask you to take Him in as life. Only He as life within us can express Himself. We cannot express God; only God Himself can express God. We need God as our life. We think that God is someone over us, above us, beside us, or behind us to support, help, and sustain us. In a sense, this is not wrong, but this is not God's central way. God's central way is to get into man to be man's life. This is why God made things so simple by putting man in front of the tree of life.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of God's Purpose by the Growth of Christ in Us &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
