If their speaking is criticism concerning others' failures, it is best to stop it, but we have to exercise our wisdom in doing so. If we tell them to stop speaking about this, we can offend them. We must say something to wisely turn the subject to other matters. However, people sometimes need to come and pour out what is on their hearts. They need to pour out their inward troubles so that they may receive grace. This kind of speaking is healthy. One can sense the repentance in this kind of speaking. After they have opened up their heart to us, we should pray with them. Moreover, we must always stay away from right and wrong. To deal with right and wrong is a temptation which belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P><P>Question: When people come to speak about their problems, is it proper to open the Word and show them how the Lord feels about their situation?</P><P>Answer: In principle this is right, but we still need much discernment. Human beings are not simple. We have to exercise our spirit to sense where the person is and what their intention is. We also must learn the lesson to be fearful and trembling, looking to the Lord whenever someone comes to us with a problem. While we are listening, we have to pray, "Lord, show me what I should receive and what I should not receive, and show me how I can help this person." To speak with people is a difficult and dangerous matter.</P><P>Question: What should we do if someone has been born again and is enjoying the Lord, but has not been touched by the Lord concerning an improper situation in which he is remaining?</P><P>Answer: The elders should contact people in a proper way, always avoiding involvement in their situations. They should try their best to simply minister Christ and the gospel with God's salvation, grace, love, mercy, and light in a pure way. Then we will get the benefit. If we do not contact people, there will be a loss; if we contact people carelessly, this will be a killing; and if we get involved in people's situations, there will be a problem. Therefore, we must try to avoid unhealthy involvement, but do our best to minister something on the positive side.</P><P>We must also realize that whatever we do will not be perfect. We should not expect that what we do will be a great success. Rather, we should admit that we do not know what the result of our contact will be. To do our best is all we can do. Perhaps we will even make some mistakes, but the Lord's mercy is with us. If the elders consider in this way, they will always be able to get people saved and bring them into the church life in a remaining way. We are very concerned for the increase in the church, and we have found that the key to the increase in a local church is the elders' contact with people. Without the elders' contact with people, it is difficult for the church to gain people. The saints may bring in people, but the key to the increase in the church is the elders. If the elders do not have a proper contact with people, those whom the saints bring to the church may not stay. The elders are the key to the church life.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 11: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (3) &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
