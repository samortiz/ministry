When God appeared on Mount Sinai, He said, "If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people" (Exo. 19:5). Immediately after hearing this word, without any objection, the children of Israel "answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do" (v. 8). How straight forward this was! The children of Israel thought that because God had saved them, led them, supplied them, and protected them to such an extent, they would absolutely obey whatever He might require of them and whatever word of command He might speak to them. So when God asked if they would obey His word, they all "answered together" and said they were most willing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE VALUE OF TESTING</H2><P>But what your mouth speaks and promises is not necessarily what your hands do or the way your feet walk. God must test you in practical matters to see if you really desire Him and His will. Although in your heart you think and also feel that you are completely willing to obey God's word, your flesh is nevertheless corrupt, and what you feel and think is hardly reliable. God must test you to see if you will really obey His commandment or not. Moses told us that God wanted to test the children of Israel, that is, to test what was in their heart, whether or not they would keep His commandments as they had promised on Mount Sinai. For this reason, God humbled them and tested them in the wilderness for forty years. Such humbling and testing were not to depress their spirit, but simply to expose their true condition.</P><P>Have we ever considered that the experience of the Israelites in the wilderness is also what we as God's children must pass through? If there had not been the humbling and testing in the wilderness as well as the failure and rebellion that resulted, who would have known that the children of Israel were so exceedingly corrupt? If we only saw the fervent promises made at Mount Sinai, would we not have considered that they were the most obedient and law-abiding people? However, those who promised with swearing at Mount Sinai are the very ones who worshipped the golden calf, murmured and lusted in the wilderness, and were unwilling to enter into Canaan. It was after so many failures that the children of Israel realized how corrupt they were and that there was nothing worth boasting of in their flesh. What they had bragged about, that is, the things in which they thought they were better than other nations, were all false. Actually, they were not one bit better than any other kingdom in this world. Then they knew that God had chosen them, not because they were superior to other nations, but because of His free grace. "`I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.' So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" (Rom. 9:15-16). The way God led the children of Israel in the past is the same way He is leading His children today. The lesson God wants to teach His children today is the same lesson He taught the children of Israel, that is, to know the self. God wants His people to know that their self is corrupt, hopeless, incurable, filthy, and weak. God wants to bring the believers to the end of themselves, to have absolutely no hope in themselves, and to know that they are useless. This is so that they will solely trust in God in helplessness, seek His will, and depend on His power to fulfill His purpose. But how many believers really feel this way? How many really know that the self is absolutely useless and is actually filled with corruption and filth? Are there not many believers who think that the self has something, can do something, or knows something? Does not every believer think he is quite reliable and that he is stronger than others? Who really knows himself thoroughly?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REASON GOD ALLOWS US TO FAIL</H2><P>God has no need to know our failure and falling. Whether we are standing up and overcoming or falling down and stumbling, God knows that the flesh is corrupt all the same. God knows our natural form. God has no hope that we will fulfill His righteousness by our flesh. He knows that we have nothing but sin. When we do good, He knows we are corrupt; when we do evil, He also knows we are corrupt. He does not need to wait until we fail or fall to know we are incurable. But we need failures and falling because, if it were not so, we could not know the self. When everything is going smoothly, when favorable winds are in the sails and we are victorious and filled with happiness, we think we are quite good and have what others do not have. Although we dare not boast in an obvious way, when we have a slight advancement in spiritual life or a slight success in spiritual work, it is hard for us not to think of ourselves and consider that we are indeed holy, able, and far superior to others. At such times, we unavoidably lose our trust in God and become careless. Therefore, God allows us to fall from glory to dust. He allows us to sin, fall, and backslide, in order that we would know that the self is unbearably corrupt, beyond cure, and that we ourselves are the same as the worst and most evil sinner in the world. As a result, we dare not assume anything in ourselves or glory in ourselves or boast in ourselves; rather, in everything we trust God with fear and trembling. Brothers, we need failures and fallings to humble us, to cause us to know the self and to know the flesh.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 08: The Present Testimony (1) &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
