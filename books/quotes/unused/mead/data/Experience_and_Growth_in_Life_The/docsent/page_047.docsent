   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Triune God Processed to Become the Life-giving Spirit in the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament, the veil is taken away and the Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Old Testament, the Lord as the Spirit was not there because the Triune God had not yet passed through any processes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Old Testament, before the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, the Triune God remained the "raw" God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in the New Testament, having passed through all these processes, the Lord became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now He is no longer "raw"; He is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In resurrection the Lord as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, not only with divinity but also with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His being the last Adam indicates His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first Adam was only a created man, but the last Adam is God incarnate, the very God with His humanity who became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE HISTORY OF THE TRIUNE GOD Incarnation, Crucifixion, and Resurrection Consummating in the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God becoming a man and this man becoming the life-giving Spirit are a great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can never fully understand this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Triune God passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection in order to give life to us is the most wonderful story in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This story is a real history.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Triune God Himself became a man of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He then voluntarily went to the cross and was crucified for six hours to accomplish an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He then was buried, and three days later He walked out of death in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When He lived on this earth, walked to the cross, was crucified, buried, and resurrected, He was in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He carried out all these things in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By such a process His humanity was uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was transferred and transformed from flesh into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His being transferred involved transformation, a transformation of humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was the procedure for His being "sonized."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sonizing is a transformation, a transfer, in which the Lord as a person with divinity and humanity became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord being the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 implies all of this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The greatest history among all the histories is the history of God becoming a man and being transferred and transformed to be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit is the consummation of the divine history.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Enlargement, Expansion, and Increase of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We also share in this divine history which has not yet been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The book of Acts is an ongoing history of Jesus through His believers; therefore, it does not have an end or a conclusion because it is still being written today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a history of God Himself in Christ with His believers as His expansion, enlargement, and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We believers are a part of the enlarged Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the revelation Paul received when the Lord spoke to him from the heavens as Paul traveled to Damascus in Acts 9.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Paul persecuted the believers of Jesus, he never thought that he was persecuting Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when the Lord Jesus spoke to him, He said, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?" v. 4 . This word indicates that the followers of Jesus become a part of Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>TRANSFERRED AND TRANSFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 2 Corinthians 3:16-18 there are five items which show us how to be transferred and how to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, the heart turns to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second, the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Third, the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fourth, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Finally, we are transformed by beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord.</S>
