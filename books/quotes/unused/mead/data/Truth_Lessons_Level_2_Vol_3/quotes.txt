[2]  In the divine dispensing we simultaneously experience and enjoy grace, love, and fellowship.
[3]  While we are enjoying the fellowship of the Spirit, we also have the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God.
[4]  The more we live in the fellowship of the Spirit, the more we receive the grace of Christ; the more we receive the grace of Christ, the more we enjoy the love of God.
[5]  Ephesians 4:6 says, "One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
[6]  God the Father receives the worship which the believers render by His Spirit Phil 3:3 here the word serve means "serve in worship" .
[7]  If we worship God the Father by rituals in a religious way, we will not be able to touch Him.
[8]  However, whenever we worship Him by the Spirit, we are able to touch Him and are brought out of ourselves into the realm of the heavens.
[9]  Coming with the Son to us and making an abode with us.
[10]  God the Father not only gives grace to us but also comes with the Son to us and makes an abode with us.
[11]  The Lord shows us here that if we love Him and keep His word, the Father will love us and then the Father with the Son will come to us and make an abode with us.
[12]  Philippians 2:13 says, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."
[13]  According to the context of this verse, God is operating in us both the willing and the working that our salvation may be carried out, brought to its ultimate conclusion.
[14]  It is not that we by ourselves carry it out, but it is the issue of God's operating in us.
[15]  IN THE LOVE OF THE TRIUNE GOD 3 OUTLINE Enabling us to live together with Christ by the power of God.
[16]  Second Corinthians 5:21 says, "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."
[17]  By becoming one with us through being incarnated in the flesh, Christ was made sin on our behalf to be judged by God.
[18]  Through His death Christ was condemned in the flesh as sin for us by God that we might be one with Him in His resurrection and have an organic union with Him.
[19]  Thus, we not only have Christ as our righteousness 1 Cor 1:30 and are made righteous before God, but we are also made the righteousness of God in Him, being reconciled to the righteous God, and are made a new creation living to God for His eternal purpose.
[20]  While the Father is operating in the believers, sanctifying them and dispensing life to them, He reveals His deep things to them through the Spirit.
[21]  Concerning God's wisdom in a mystery, the apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2:9-10, "But as it is written, Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man's heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him.'
[22]  This shows us that to realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared for us requires us not only to believe in Him but also to love Him.
[23]  To love God means to set our entire being spirit, soul, and body, with the heart, soul, mind, and strength Mark 12:30 absolutely on Him, that is, to let our entire being be occupied by Him and lost in Him, so that He becomes everything to us and we are one with Him practically in our daily life.
[24]  The fine and deep work that God the Father is carrying out within us is also to make us, the believers, His poem.
[25]  Ephesians 2:10 says, "For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus."
[26]  IN THE LOVE OF THE TRIUNE GOD 4 OUTLINE Enabling us to enjoy the grace given by Him to announce the riches of Christ and the economy of God's mystery.
[27]  Making us competent to bear the ministry of the new covenant.
[28]  Leading us in the triumphal procession of Christ and manifesting through us the fragrance of Christ.
[29]  When the Father dispenses Himself as grace into us the believers and enables us to announce the all-inclusive Christ and make known to people what is the economy of the mystery hidden in God, He makes us competent to bear the ministry of the new covenant.
[30]  In 2 Corinthians 3:5 Paul says, "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God."
[31]  Paul's experience in Philippians 2 shows us that the Father's having mercy on us is also His dispensing.
[32]  In verse 25 Paul told the Philippians, "But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your apostle and minister to my need."
[33]  God the Father cares for the needs of His children in their living.
[34]  Matthew 6:31-32 says, "Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?
[35]  IN THE LOVE OF THE TRIUNE GOD 5 OUTLINE Guarding us from stumbling and causing us to be without blemish.
[36]  Romans 16:20 says, "Now the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly."
[37]  This word of God's promise is spoken to those who are in the church life, because the preceding verses show the concern between the saints and the fellowship among the churches.
[38]  In 2 Thessalonians 1:11 the apostle Paul prayed for the believers, saying "that our God may count you worthy of your calling and may fulfill in power your every good intention for goodness and your work of faith."
[39]  We, the believers in Christ, have been made a new creation by God for good works, that is, for doing the will of God.
[40]  In 2 Corinthians 5:4-5 Paul said, "For also, we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, in that we do not desire to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
[41]  The final issue of our experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in love is that we believers will be led into glory.
[42]  Hebrews 2:10 tells us that God is "leading many sons into glory."
[43]  Most Christians regard God merely as an object of worship.
[44]  However, from the Bible we see that God is not only an object of worship; He is our portion for us to enjoy.
[45]  We enjoy Christ not only as our Redeemer but also as our Savior Titus 1:4 .
[46]  On the one hand, the Lord Jesus died for us and thus accomplished redemption to be our Redeemer; on the other hand, He was raised from the dead and enters into us to be our Savior in life.
[47]  Romans 5:10 shows us that while we were enemies, through His death, that is, through His redeeming death on the cross, we were reconciled to God; that is, the charge of sins against us before God was settled and we were redeemed.
[48]  Hebrews 2:11 says, "For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One."
[49]  He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God.
[50]  As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is also the freeing and transforming Spirit.
[51]  In addition to being the door and the pasture, Christ is our Shepherd.
[52]  He calls His sheep by name and leads them out of the fold.
[53]  Christ is our abiding place, our home, and we can abide in Him to have fellowship with Him and enjoy all His riches.
[54]  Christ is not only our spiritual food to be our daily life supply; He is also the rock flowing with the spiritual drink to quench our thirst.
[55]  The spiritual drink refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock Exo 17:6 , which typifies the Spirit who flowed out of the crucified and resurrected Christ as our all-inclusive drink John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 12:13 .
[56]  Christ is also the believers' way to the Father.
[57]  In John 14:6 the Lord said, "I am the way...; no one comes to the Father except through Me."
[58]  This clearly indicates that Christ is the way for man to enter into God.
[59]  Ephesians 2:14 says, "He Christ Himself is our peace."
[60]  Christ is not only the believers' peace and joy but also their rest.
[61]  In Matthew 11:28 the Lord Jesus called people, saying, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest."
[62]  Colossians 2:16-17 also indicates that Christ is the new moon.
[63]  As such a new moon to us, Christ affords us a new beginning with light in this dark age.
[64]  Ephesians 6:14 also speaks of the putting on of the breastplate of righteousness.
[65]  The breastplate of righteousness covers our conscience, signified by the breast.
[66]  In Ephesians 6:17 Paul also told us to receive "the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God."
[67]  After we put on the girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, and the shoes of the gospel of peace, and we take up the shield of faith and receive the helmet of salvation, we are entirely protected, and we may then receive the sword of the Spirit.
[68]  IN THE GRACE OF THE TRIUNE GOD 5 OUTLINE As our portion: The One living within us that we may live Him.
[69]  In Galatians 4:19 Paul said, "My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you."
[70]  When the Galatian believers were regenerated through Paul's preaching of the gospel to them the first time, Christ was born into them but not formed in them.
[71]  First, Christ was born into us at the time we repented and believed in Him, then He lives in us in our Christian life, and, finally, He will be formed in us at our maturity.
[72]  In Philippians 4:13 Paul said, "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me."
[73]  First Corinthians 2:10 says, "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God."
[74]  According to the context of this verse, the depths of God refer to the deep things of God, which are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God.
[75]  The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation.
[76]  Hebrews 2:10 says, "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
[77]  The last step of God's great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory.
[78]  In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul said, "For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ."
[79]  Therefore, we should belong only to Him, and we should present ourselves to Him to love Him, to appreciate Him, and to enjoy Him as our life and everything.
[80]  Romans 14:8 says, "For whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord.
[81]  As believers, we also have Christ as our Brother.
[82]  He is the elder Brother, and we are the many brothers.
[83]  The Lord is also a Helper to us, the believers.
[84]  Hebrews 13:5 says that we should let our way of life be without the love of money, being satisfied with the things which are at hand, for the Lord will by no means give us up, neither by any means will He abandon us.
