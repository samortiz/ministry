<p>Furthermore, in order for a board to stand, it cannot depend on only one tenon. If there were only one tenon, the board would spin, but with two tenons, the board could not spin. Hence, in the matter of building, there is the need for two; one cannot work alone. This is coordination. If you stand by yourself, you will turn toward the east today, toward the south tomorrow, and toward the west the next day. After turning a full circle, you will turn toward the south again, and after a few days you will turn again. You will always be turning. A Christian who is always turning cannot be built up with others. When there are two tenons, you have no way to turn. Therefore, you must stand with another. You cannot serve by yourself. When the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, He sent them out two by two (Luke 10:1). The Lord did not want His disciples to go out by themselves.</p>
<p>Our coordination should also be in twos. We cannot be at peace if someone is serving alone, because we are afraid that he will begin to turn. When two persons are in coordination, one cannot turn without the other turning too. There is no way for one to turn if the other refuses to turn. They both must stand firm. Not only so, you must remember that you are only a half. You are only one and a half cubits, not three cubits. You need another person, another one and a half cubits, to be added to you so that you become three cubits. When one sister is added to another sister, the two become three cubits. They become a complete unit. If they are separated, they will each be one and a half cubits. This is a half unit, not a complete unit. For this reason, the Holy Spirit has revealed to us that we must be in coordination.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Gold Overlaying Wood</h2>
<p>In order for us to coordinate, based on the foundation of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, we must be overlaid with gold. This is seen with the boards, which were made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold. This is the only way for us to manifest the proper coordination. Wood denotes the human nature, and gold denotes the divine nature. Gold overlaying wood signifies the mingling of the human nature and the divine nature so that the human nature can express the divine nature. This means that man lives the life of God. In other words, there is a human living that expresses the glory of God. The boards, which were made of acacia wood, needed to be overlaid with gold in order to be joined. Therefore, when we experience the mingling of God and man, that is, the mingling of God&rsquo;s life with our life and God&rsquo;s nature with our nature, we can be coordinated with the other standing boards.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Gold Rings</h2>
<p>The standing boards were also united by gold rings (Exo. 26:29). Gold signifies the divine nature. The uniting rings show that the divine nature is the uniting power among us. We are made of wood. In order to experience the uniting rings in our human nature, we need the divine life and nature to be manifested in us. The more we love the Lord, live before Him, and fellowship with Him, the more He will be manifested in us. Thus, the gold rings, the divine uniting power, are manifested in us and enable us to be united with others.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Bars</h2>
<p>There was also the need for bars. On each side of the tabernacle there were five bars for the boards. The bars were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold (vv. 26-29). The five bars formed three lines, and the middle bar passed through the center of the boards from end to end. The bars were arranged such that two bars formed a line at the top, two bars formed a line below, and one bar passed through the middle. Hence, the numbers three and five are also involved with the bars. Three signifies the three-one God. Five is four plus one, signifying the created man plus the Creator being able to bear spiritual responsibility.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</h2>
<p>The uniting of the boards lies entirely in the gold. The boards were overlaid with gold, and the bars that were overlaid with gold united the boards. The boards were united by means of the gold. Likewise, we can be united to be the church, the house of God, because we have the nature of God. We are &ldquo;wooden boards.&rdquo; If we did not have the divine nature, He could not be expressed in us. If we live according to our human nature, according to the flesh, we will eventually be scattered. When we live in the divine nature, we are overlaid with gold. In this way, we are full of gold, full of the expression of God&rsquo;s glory, His nature. We must remember that we are all united in oneness by the gold of God&rsquo;s divine nature. As a result, not only are we standing, but we are also united.</p>
<p>According to Exodus 27:1-8, the bronze altar in the outer court did not have any silver. The bronze altar had only bronze. Bronze signifies God&rsquo;s judgment. The hangings of fine twined linen in the outer court were held and joined by hooks and connecting rods, both of which were made of silver (vv. 9-17). This means that Christ&rsquo;s redemption, which issues out of God&rsquo;s righteous judgment, links us to God&rsquo;s righteousness, signified by the linen, for God&rsquo;s testimony and expression. In other words, Christ&rsquo;s redemption as our foundation brings us into God&rsquo;s nature and mingles us with God so that we can be overlaid with gold. Then we can have the building. It is not enough for us to be redeemed by the Lord and have a little change in our behavior and our living, because God still does not have His building. We must be overlaid with gold. We must let God mingle Himself with us. As we are overlaid with gold, the divine and human natures are mingled together. On the one hand, we stand on Christ&rsquo;s redemption as our foundation, and on the other hand, we are mingled with the divine nature. This is the way for us to become a structure, God&rsquo;s building, in which there is God&rsquo;s presence and His glory.</p>
<p>If we would express God and be full of His glory and presence, we must be joined to Him. The more we are joined to Him, the more we will have His presence. When we are all joined by the divine nature, we will be filled with the presence and the glory of God. Even though we have the human nature, we will live in the divine nature because we are overlaid with gold. We will be human beings who live by God&rsquo;s life and nature. The more we live in the divine life and nature, the more we will have the atmosphere and element of gold filling our midst. Furthermore, by means of the gold we will be joined into one to become God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Then God&rsquo;s glory will fill our midst. This is the building up of the church, and this is also the presence of God.</p>
<p>Then whoever comes into our midst will sense the glory of Jehovah. When they contact us, they will acknowledge that God is among us and that this is God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
