   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the shell of the Lord s humanity was broken on the cross, the divine life within Him was released in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The release of the divine life and nature from within the Lord as a grain of wheat was His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He prayed for this glorification in John 17:1: Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Lord Jesus was incarnated, He put on humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that no longer was He merely God, for through incarnation He had become the God-man, having both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, it was necessary for His humanity to be brought into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The bringing of the Lord s humanity into divinity was His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the New Testament revelation, when the Lord Jesus rose up from the dead, He rose up with both His divinity and His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means He rose up as the God-man.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hallelujah, now there is a man in the glory!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When some hear that the man Jesus is now in glory, they may understand this to mean that He is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, Luke 24:26 indicates that He entered into glory even before His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While on the way to Emmaus, He said to the disciples, Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This refers to His resurrection, which brought Him into glory 1 Cor 15:43; Acts 3:13a, 15a .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Man-Savior s resurrection was His entering into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, glorification means not only that the Son of God was released from His human shell, but also that the Lord s humanity has been brought into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Have you ever heard a message telling you that your Savior was glorified when His humanity was brought into divinity?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Often Christians are told that Christ has glory mainly because He is great.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the Bible reveals that the Lord became a man of low estate.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He not only has honor, dignity, and glory; His resurrection was His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Birth of God s Firstborn Son</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Man-Savior s glorification was also His birth as God s firstborn Son.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From eternity Christ was God s only begotten Son.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was even prophesied in Psalm 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In resurrection God begot Jesus to be His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word firstborn indicates that there will be other sons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hebrews 2:10 speaks of many sons, and Romans 8:29, of many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In resurrection the Lord came to His brothers, who composed His church, and declared the Father s name to them Heb 2:12 .</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then in resurrection this God-man was born of God to be His Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is important for us to realize that, before incarnation, God s only begotten Son did not have human nature, only the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, in resurrection, God s firstborn Son has a human nature as well as the divine nature.</S>
