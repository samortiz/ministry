   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE SECOND TESTIMONY Given on October 20, 1936</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today I want to testify concerning four things: 1 learning the lesson of the cross, 2 leading in the work, 3 receiving healing to my sickness and experiencing God as my Healer, and 4 four aspects of work entrusted by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>LEARNING THE LESSON OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A believer may read, study, or expound a teaching concerning the cross, while at the same time not necessarily receive the lesson of the cross or know the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was being tempered together in the service with my co-workers, the Lord ordered many crosses for me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times I felt embarrassed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would not accept the dealing of the cross and found it difficult to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Inwardly, however, I knew that if the cross were ordered by the Lord, it would be the right thing, though it would still be difficult to obey and accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While the Lord was on the earth, He learned obedience by the cross which He suffered Heb 5:8; Phil 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How could I be an exception?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the first eight or nine months, when the lesson of the cross began to come, I would not obey.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I knew that I should yield without resistance to the cross ordered by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I would make up my mind to obey, my determination would last only a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When some event would arise where I should obey, I found it difficult to obey and was full of rebellious thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This made me very uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once I recognized the cross which the Lord had ordered for me, I found it very beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among my co-workers, five had been my schoolmates since childhood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Another one came from a different city and was five years older than I. The five always sided with him and opposed me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No matter what I did, they would invariably condemn me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They received the credit for many things I did.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes when they rejected my views, I went to a lonely hill to cry before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At these times I wrote some hymns on bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the first time I experienced the significance of "the fellowship of His sufferings" Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I could not have fellowship with the world, I could enjoy heavenly fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first two years after my salvation, I did not know what the cross was.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But at this time I was beginning to learn its lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was always ranked first in my class as well as in my school.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I also wanted to be first in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this reason, when I was made second, I disobeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I told God repeatedly that it was too much for me to bear; I was receiving too little honor and authority, and everyone sided with my elder co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But today I worship God and thank Him from the depths of my heart that this all happened to me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It has been the best training.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God wished me to learn obedience, so He arranged for me to encounter many difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, I told Him I was willing to be placed second.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I became willing to yield, the joy I experienced differed from the joy I experienced at the time of my salvation; it was not a broad joy but a deep one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After another eight or nine months, on many occasions I was willing to be broken and did not do what I wished.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On my spiritual path I was filled with joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord submitted to the hand of God, and I was willing to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself Phil 2:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How dare I rank myself above the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I first began to learn obedience it was difficult, but as time went on I found it easier and easier.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, I told God that I would choose the cross, accept its breaking, and put aside my own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>LEADING IN THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When God's work started in several places in China in 1921, some truths were not clearly distinguished.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For instance, grace and law were not clearly defined; nor were the kingdom of heaven and eternal life, grace and reward, or salvation and victory clearly differentiated.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The understanding of truths in the Lord was neither deep nor rich enough.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, the understanding of the gospel of grace was comparatively clear, and it was being quite clearly preached at that time when Mr. Wang Ming Tao was in Tehchow, Sister Pearl Wang and Ruth Lee were in Nanking, and some other workers and I were in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Publishing The Present Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By the end of 1922 I had a burden to publish a magazine, because a number had been saved in Foochow, and the number was increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time, Brother Leland Wang was away in the Yangtze region doing evangelistic work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only his wife and children were at home.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He asked me to move into his house to help take care of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Daily, Sister Wang and I prayed for the magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I was at that time extremely pressed financially.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After praying for more than a month, there was not a single dollar on hand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One morning I arose and said, "There is no need to pray further that would be a lack of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What I must do is start writing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God need not put the money into our hands before we begin to write!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Henceforth, I will no longer pray for this matter, but will proceed with the preparation of drafts."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When everything was ready and the last word had been written, I said, "Now the money will come."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Eventually, I knelt down to pray again, saying, "O God, the draft is ready for printing, but there is still no money."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After praying thus, I felt wonderfully confident that God would certainly give the money.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We began to praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The amazing thing was that we had no more risen to our feet than there was a knock at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I thought someone was coming with the money.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>That house being Sister Wang's, I let her answer the door.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To my surprise, the one who came was a wealthy yet stingy sister.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"Oh, since it is she," I thought, "there could be no money."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But she said to me, "I have something extremely important to see you about."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"Please tell me," I replied.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then she asked, "How should a Christian donate?"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I replied that we should not adopt the Old Testament way of paying tithes, but follow the word in 2 Corinthians 9:7, which says that each person should give according to the order of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He may donate a half, a third, a tenth, or a twentieth of his income.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>She then asked, "Where should the donation be made?"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I answered, "Do not give it to a church which opposes the Lord, nor to those who do not believe the Bible or the redemption of the Lord's shed blood.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If no one contributes to them, they will not be able to carry on their preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Pray before each donation; then give it either to the poor or to some work, but never to an improper organization."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>She said, "The Lord has been speaking to me for many days concerning my excessive devotion to money.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At first I could not reconcile myself to this, but now I can do so.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When I was praying this morning, the Lord said to me, There is no need for you to pray anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Just start giving away your money.'</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I was rather disconcerted, but now I am here with thirty dollars for you to use for the Lord's work."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This money was just sufficient for the printing of fourteen hundred copies of The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Later, another person gave an additional thirty dollars, which was sufficient for the postage and incidental expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is how the first issue of The Present Testimony was published.</S>
