<p>Another item is the children&rsquo;s gospel work. We should assign at least ten full-time serving ones to concentrate on the children. It would be best for most of them to be sisters. At present, no more than five hundred children come to the meetings. We hope that we can increase this number to one thousand. The children&rsquo;s meetings should be carried out in the homes. There should not be more than twelve children in a class, and they can have three high school sisters or brothers as their teachers. The full-time co-workers should promote this work, prepare the teaching materials, and take care of all the other matters.</p>
<p>Every children&rsquo;s home meeting should frequently preach the gospel and invite their relatives and the children of their neighbors. Even though some parents will not come, they will allow their children to come. We believe that many people will be brought in through the children&rsquo;s gospel work. I hope that we will have two thousand children by next spring, three thousand by the summer, and four thousand by next fall. There is a great future in this work. If we take this way, there will be ten thousand children in the church in Taipei within two to three years. At least two to three thousand children out of the ten thousand will not be the children of the saints. The children&rsquo;s meetings will open up a way to gain people, especially the parents of the other children.

<p>In the future the full-time co-workers will encourage preaching the gospel on the campuses, in the homes, to the children, and in the community. Full-timers are needed for the gospel on the campuses and in the schools; otherwise, it will be difficult to maintain the gospel work. With regard to the children&rsquo;s work, even though the junior high and high school students can teach in the children&rsquo;s meetings, the children&rsquo;s work will be carried forward by the full-timers, because they will prepare teaching materials and make a schedule. The number of children in the church in Taipei has dropped to five hundred because there is a lack of co-workers to carry the work forward. If the children&rsquo;s work is to spread, we must preach the gospel. We should not limit our work to the children of the saints who are in our meetings; we also need to invite the children of our neighbors and friends. Furthermore, we hope that every home will be open for the gospel. This requires that the co-workers visit the saints in order to encourage them to open their homes and that the co-workers help the saints who are willing to open their homes to speak. Initially, the co-workers will have to take the lead in the homes, but after a few gospel times, the saints will be able to take care of the meeting. We need to be flexible in our practice. On the one hand, the co-workers need to go out and encourage the saints, and on the other hand, the saints should not depend on the elders and co-workers; they must learn to do things themselves. (<em>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service,</em> p. 160)</p>

<p>We must realize that the children&rsquo;s work is a crucial burden. Every locality must be aggressive in the children&rsquo;s work, because there is a greater future in the children&rsquo;s work than in the campus work. Generally speaking, it is easier to bring in children, and once they come in, they usually remain. Our history confirms this fact. The church in Manila is an example. Most of the saints in the church in Manila were gained by the children&rsquo;s work. Ninety percent of the churches in the Philippines are maintained by saints in their thirties, and most of these saints grew up in the church and attended the children&rsquo;s meeting.</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we frequently have to go out to gain people; we even go to the campuses to gain people. These people are along the roads and hedges (Luke 14:23). There is only one group of people who are not along the roads: the children in our own homes. Why do we not work on our own children? The people along the roads might come today or tomorrow, but the people in our own homes will always be there. Furthermore, our children can bring other children. Therefore, they should be a crucial focus of our work. This work is long-lasting and remaining. A child who is six years old today will be thirteen in seven years. That is a good age to enter the church life. When they enter the church life, they are our young brothers and sisters. When they enter junior high school, they will be gospel seeds. Through them, it will be easier for us to work in the junior high schools. (<em>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service,</em> pp. 218-219)</p>

<p>Even in our neighborhood there must be a children&rsquo;s meeting that should not be considered as the children&rsquo;s meeting of the church. This is a children&rsquo;s meeting work in the saints&rsquo; neighborhood. It is easy for us to set up two children&rsquo;s meetings. Every week one sister can take care of two children&rsquo;s meetings with four helpers. On one day, two sisters can assist this one to take care of twenty children. Maybe on another afternoon two more sisters may help to take care of another children&rsquo;s meeting of fifteen to twenty children. We can collect a number of children out of our neighborhood into our home. We can ask the children to sit down on the carpet. We do not even need a piano. There is no need for materials or textbooks, but one living person. She can even sing a song to the children. Within two months we can build up two children&rsquo;s meetings. Then after six months we will have six children&rsquo;s meetings. One sister will not need to take care of all the meetings directly because other sisters will follow her example and have their own meetings. There may be ten children&rsquo;s meetings under the direction of one sister. This would expand to over a thousand children. All of these children are linked to their parents. So through the children many homes will be opened for the church to evangelize. This is the community work. These are the <em>warm doors</em> and the parents will welcome us. Although people today are occupied by many things and it seems as if they are not open to the gospel, the best way to overcome this is to have a children&rsquo;s meeting in our own home. The responsibility for this community work lies with the elders. (<em>Talks concerning the Church Services, Part 2,</em> pp. 39-40)</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO THE CHILDREN</h2>
<p>The third way of gospel preaching is to preach the gospel to the children. This requires the sisters to pick up the burden. It is not necessary to use the meeting hall as the place for the gospel meeting. Rather, it is best to meet at the saints&rsquo; homes. Use the weekends to gather the children from your neighborhood and to invite the children of your relatives and friends to your home. Many times parents are saved through their children, so do not overlook the children&rsquo;s work. If, starting from now, we use our effort to work on the gospel for children whose ages range from six to twelve, then after ten or twelve years, they will be those who will rise up to bear the responsibility of the church service. This way may seem slow, but it is actually very fast. This way is also profitable. (<em>Truth, Life, the Church, and the Gospel&mdash;The Four Great Pillars of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery,</em> p. 130)</p>

<p>In the past the children&rsquo;s meeting was always held in the meeting hall and was mostly led by the young people. Now the gospel work on the college campuses and at the junior high and high schools is very active, and the young people all have specific services in this work. Thus, they cannot take care of the children anymore. Hence, we need to rely on the elderly saints to spend the time and effort to teach the children...The elderly saints may use their homes. After the children get off from school, the elderly saints may open their homes and prepare some snacks to welcome them. Then they may sing with the children, tell them stories, and lead them to know God.</p>
<p>Every one of us should be able to do these three things&mdash;pray every day, join the small group meetings, and go door-knocking and have home meetings every week. The fourth matter is taking care of the children. I hope that more people will receive the burden to open their homes to take care of the children. Twenty years ago I said that we should have ten thousand children in Taipei, and then ten years later we would have ten thousand young brothers and sisters. If the saints had taken this word and practiced it, we would have twenty to thirty thousand young people today. Moreover, gaining people in this way is very safe, because they are taught by us and receive the gospel from us from their youth. Thus, they should be very solid. If this were the case, many young saints would not need to put aside their gospel work at school to do the children&rsquo;s work. I hope that from now on the elderly saints would pick up the burden and take the lead to do this in their homes. The effect will be very promising in the long run.
