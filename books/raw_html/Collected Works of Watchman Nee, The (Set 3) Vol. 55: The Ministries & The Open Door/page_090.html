<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Condition of<br />the Church in Wanxian</h2><p>HISTORY: In the spring of 1949, Brother Chen Fa-guang and his wife returned from Shanghai to Szechuan after the church laid hands on them and prayed. They brought the fire of the gospel with them and scattered the seeds of the gospel all over Wanxian. After approximately one year of preaching the gospel once a week on the street corners and in buildings, the number of those who had signed their names as believers had reached more than three hundred. Beginning the third day of the Chinese New Year, gospel meetings were held every day for seven days, and fruit was gained officially. Thirty to forty people were raised up at once. A regular meeting place was found through the Lord's marvelous arrangement, and meetings officially began.</p><p>MEETING HALL ADDRESS: 274 Huan Cheng Road, Wanxian (Brother Lee Guang-min's house). It is in a good location.</p><p>CAPACITY: The room at the back can accommodate eighty or ninety people. The front room can also be used. In total there is capacity for more than one hundred people with appropriate ventilation and light.</p><p>CURRENT MEETINGS: Wednesday Prayer Meeting, Saturday Fellowship Meeting, Lord's Day Gospel Meetings</p><p>NUMBER IN THE MEETINGS: Usually around forty or fifty.</p><p>NUMBER BAPTIZED: The first baptism meeting was held outside the city on June 18, and twenty-one brothers and sisters were baptized.</p><p>THE LORD'S TABLE: We have not officially started breaking bread together.</p><p>NEARBY CHURCHES: Chungking is upstream. Hankow is downstream.</p><p>OTHER DENOMINATIONAL CHURCHES: Episcopalian Church (including China Inland Mission), Gospel Church, Lutheran Church, Seventh-day Adventist Church, and Catholic Church.</p><p>LOCATION OF WANXIAN: Wanxian is located on the north bank of the Yangtze River in the eastern region of Szechuan province. It is the largest city in eastern Szechuan and is one of Szechuan's three largest cities: Ch'eng-tu, Chungking, and Wanxian. It is a large port for river traffic on the Yangtze and is the unloading point for goods destined for eastern Szechuan and western Hupeh. Szechuan province covers a large area, and if eastern Szechuan were a separate province, it would be larger than Chekiang province. For this reason, Wanxian can be considered the center of eastern Szechuan for the sake of the gospel.</p><p>POPULATION OF WANXIAN: The entire county has a population of 800,000, and 200,000 of them live in the city of Wanxian.</p><p>COMMUNICATION AND TRANSPORTATION: River Traffic: It takes two days traveling upstream to reach Chungking and one day traveling downstream to reach Yichang. Passing steamers regularly make stops here. Land Traffic: The Wanxian-Chungking Highway passes through Liangshan, Dazhu, and Daxian. An express bus can reach it in one day. The Wan-Kai (County) Highway is not open yet.</p><p>PRODUCTION: This area produces rice, tung-oil, hog's bristles, cow and sheep skins, tangerines, and oranges, but tung-oil is the largest industry. Presently, there is a large spinning factory and three small flour factories. The rest are all small industries. (For example: rice husking, machine repairs, tanning leather, and dying cloth.)</p>
