   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING UNABLE TO CARE FOR GOD S HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND CARE FOR OUR HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some Western missionaries once confronted me, saying that the brothers who are responsible for the group meetings should take proper care of their own households and not be in so many meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although these brothers had a good intention, we should ask, Whose house is more important, God s house or ours?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a matter of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We cannot say Amen to the attitude that the Western missionaries have toward their families.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead of sacrificing their households for the Lord s household, they sacrifice the Lord s household for theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot say Amen to this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Perhaps their families are wonderful, but what is the condition of the church they lead?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Almost all the saints who serve the Lord have families.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If they would spend all their time with their families, producing families that are like happy gardens and children who are like angels, God s house would be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a matter of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If our consecration is absolute, even our children may rise up to oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>None of the children of the Western missionaries oppose their parents, because the missionaries care too much for their families.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some of them did not have servants in their own countries, but when they come to China, they hire someone to cook, someone to take care of the children, someone to do the laundry and cleaning, and a gardener, a driver, and even a guard.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are truly consecrated, the first ones to oppose us will be our children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason, I question the consecration of the missionaries who speak irresponsibly and sarcastically.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even though they are God s servants, we should not learn from their way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is undeniable that we should do our best to care for our families.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, we also need to be clear concerning consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A certain responsible brother has five children, and the group meeting he is responsible for has over a hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If he only takes care of his family, he cannot take care of the one hundred brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he only takes care of the one hundred brothers and sisters, he would not be able to take adequate care of his family.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is difficult to know how to take care of the group meeting properly while adequately caring for his family.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Taking care of the group meeting requires one s whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We even need to consider the group meeting in our dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we imitate the Western missionaries in how they care for their families, the result of our labor in the church will match theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At critical moments they say, Brothers, I can no longer do this work because I must be with my children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We, however, cannot do this because of our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May God bless us so that our families will receive mercy and care.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, we must be warned that the way of some missionaries is not our way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not take the way of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BEING UNABLE TO SERVE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>BOTH THE LORD AND MAMMON</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother T. Austin-Sparks once said that there are some problems with the Western missionaries in organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We acknowledge that they traveled to a distant land for Christ s sake, but this does not mean that all the missionaries who came to China sacrificed and consecrated themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have no intention to condemn their lifestyle, but we must know that the way of consecration results in many sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before we consecrate ourselves, we do not have many problems with our studies, jobs, or families.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But once we consecrate ourselves, there are many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before we consecrated ourselves, we may have been good teachers, doctors, civil servants, parents, or children, but the more we consecrate ourselves, the less capable we become and the more problems we encounter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a sense, the One who troubles people the most is Jesus; He has wrecked innumerable people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many talented ones have been wrecked by Him; many good students, good professors, good fathers, and good mothers have all been wrecked by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I was in Manila a group of young brothers and sisters asked me to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My first sentence was, Jesus wrecks people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The young people in Manila need to be wrecked by Jesus, and the Christian families of the overseas Chinese in Manila need to be wrecked by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not think that our work in Southeast Asia is welcomed by people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Over the past few years we have been fighting the battle every day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I was in Manila in 1955, on one hand, the brothers there respected me, regarded me highly, and treated me well, but on the other hand, I was in a battle with them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I was fighting the battle concerning heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I wanted to eradicate the concept of heaven from the core of their being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I told them that as Christians we should not think that being a Christian is a matter of asking for blessings, longevity, peace, of fearing the Lord, and of not sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Neither is it a matter of going to heaven to enjoy eternal blessings when we die.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such a gospel may seem very attractive, but this is altogether a religious concept that considers Jesus to be a person who is more trustworthy than a Buddha.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, I was strong in fighting the battle concerning going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I showed them the Lord s word in the Gospels: If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, even his own soul-life, he cannot be My disciple Luke 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This strong word touched the heart of those who love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In a love feast I fellowshipped about how to read the Bible and pray, to receive grace and an answer to our prayers, and to be shown mercy by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A brother asked why I did not speak this way to all the saints but rather spoke of forsaking everything for the Lord and consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I immediately responded, Dear brother, do you need me to give messages that even you can give?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After the meal I said to the elderly brothers that they needed to consider their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They should not simply say that the young people love the world and have no reality; rather, they need to consider their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When they saw me later, they were ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who love the world should be ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, whoever believes in Jesus will be wrecked.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Everyone who has genuinely believed in Jesus is wrecked by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is not corrupted by Him but wrecked by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the young people want to follow Jesus, they will have problems at their schools.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If one is a doctor, he should not expect to prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Most of those who live a smooth and prosperous life have problems with their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A person who is able to prosper as a doctor, make money as a businessman, become famous as a professor, be recognized as a top student, or be an excellent father must have problems with his consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A person can serve only one master.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If he is occupied with his studies, he will not have room for Jesus, and if he is occupied with Jesus, he will not have room for his studies.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Similarly, if he is occupied with his children, he will not have room for Jesus, and if he is occupied by Jesus, he will not have room for his children.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, it is impossible for a person to serve the Lord properly and also be a good doctor or a good father in the eyes of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is not difficult for a person to be well respected as long as he does not consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, this does not mean that those who serve the Lord and preach the word should behave unbecomingly.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to conduct ourselves in a manner that is respectable and worthy of man s praise when we serve the Lord and preach the word.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we want to be absolute in our consecration, we must be prepared to live a life of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This price is set before us, and we must count the cost.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In these days the enemy is not only doing a dissenting work among us, but he is also leading many to weaken their consecration and be compromising Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We cannot serve the Lord on one hand and belong to the world on the other; we cannot be successful in both.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If all the serving ones would take good care of their careers and families, they would be more successful in their careers and they could take better care of their families.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This can be compared to taking care of a garden by weeding and watering it every day.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Such a garden surely will be beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If a person manages a hospital and labors diligently every day, that hospital will surely be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is similar to the matter of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we devote ourselves to care for our careers, studies, and families, we should not expect the church to flourish.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Instead, the church will be desolate and deserted.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we give our careers and families priority and put the Lord and the church in second place, the church will have no increase.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Meeting every day may cause us to suffer certain personal losses.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But we must ask ourselves concerning the purpose of our existence.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Are we here for our house or for God s house?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>A Western missionary in Manila testified that his oldest daughter and second son wanted to be preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He rejoiced that many of his children were preachers and that his family was a family of missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we live a comfortable and easy life and do not pay a price to follow the Lord, our children will want to follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Such preachers can travel around the world, have servants, suffer no lack, and be highly regarded by others.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>How many people can live the kind of life they do?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If they took the way of a Nazarite, it is unlikely that their children would still want to be preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Because those who serve the Lord in China have taken the way of consecration, none of their children have desired to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we want to do a work of consecration and to take the narrow way in the Lord s recovery, we should not expect that there will be a comfortable life ahead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We cannot trust the way of the Western missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we take their way, we will do a work of Christianity, not the work of building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When we do the work of building up the church, our fame, reputation, family, energy, and natural man will be wrecked.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Our reputation and what we are will be wrecked.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Those who desire to serve the Lord and maintain respectability in their family, career, and studies have taken the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>There is no way for us to be successful in both.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If we want to allow the Lord to build and gain something, our consecration must be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is not merely a matter of following our parents or husbands because we have a desire to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This is a matter of being wrecked by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He will wreck our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This is a matter of genuine consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>However, this does not mean that we do not need to study, have a career, or take care of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We should not abandon everything.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We should and must do our best in our studies, in taking care of our family, and in working.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>However, when there is a conflict between the two, we should ask which side should win.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Should the Lord Jesus win the victory, or should our own benefit win the victory?</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We should also ask which side has the highest priority within us.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>What is our primary occupation?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We should all have a definite answer before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Do we regard the Lord Jesus and His work as primary or secondary?</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If we want to do a work of Christianity, we can regard what pertains to us as primary and what pertains to the Lord as secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If we want to build up the church, we need to give the Lord priority.</S>
