   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Building of Sodom</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While Abraham lived in the tent, his nephew fell into the city of Sodom which was another counterfeit building of Satan Gen 13:12-13; 18:20; 19:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to history, Babel was a city of idols, and Sodom was a city of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Building in Jacob s Dream Bethel</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With Babel and Sodom as the background, God, according to His selection, visited Jacob, a supplanter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jacob knew nothing of God s selection; he only knew how to be crafty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, God was sovereign, forcing him to leave his parents home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While he was wandering, he slept one night in the open air.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That night he had a dream in which he saw a ladder set up from the earth to the heavens Gen 28:10-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The angels of God were ascending and descending upon this ladder.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Jacob awoke from his sleep he said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we have already pointed out, Bethel means the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Genesis 28:18-19 says that Jacob took the stone that he had put for his pillow, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And he called the name of that place Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Scripturally speaking, a stone symbolizes a transformed person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the Bible, the oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit, the third Person of the Godhead, reaching human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever the Triune God reaches a human being through the Person of the Holy Spirit, that man will become a part of Bethel, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all are stones which have been anointed with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, we are the Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although I do not know where Jacob acquired the oil, he nevertheless anointed the stone with it and called it Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Building</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>of Pharaoh s Treasure Cities</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, Jacob s descendants did not stay in the promised land, but went down into Egypt where they were forced to build Pharaoh s treasure cities Exo 1:11-14 , which were further counterfeits of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Have you noticed the alternation between the positive and the negative, between God s building and Satan s counterfeit?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This resembles the alternation of night and day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After each night we have a day, and after each day we have a night.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After Jacob s positive dream, we have the building of Pharaoh s treasure cities, cities of worldly enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Building of the Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the night of Pharaoh s treasure cities, we have the day of the building of the tabernacle Exo 25:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the midst of all the cities on the negative side we have the building of God s tabernacle on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jacob s descendants were rescued from Egypt and brought to Mt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After they were released from the bondage of Pharaoh, they became God s freed people, being made by God s mercy and grace a kingdom of priests Exo 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then God charged them to build a tabernacle as His dwelling place among them on earth, and He showed them the heavenly pattern that they might build it according to God s plan and design.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And they did accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From that time there was a real and practical building of God as His habitation on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That tabernacle with the altar was the enlargement of Noah s and Abraham s tents and altars.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was not only God s dwelling place, but also a place for God s priests to stay with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was not only a full type of Christ, but also a prefigure of the church as the enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the utensils within it were types of the different aspects of Christ as the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It fulfilled God s plan in the way of type, expressed the heart s desire of God, and satisfied Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, after it was builded and erected, God s glory filled it Exo 40:17, 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Building of the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the tabernacle was built, it was carried through the wilderness and was brought into God s promised land, remaining there as God s habitation on earth until the temple was built 1 Kings 6:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Its history lasted for about five hundred years, from approximately 1500 to approximately 1000 B.C., and is recorded from Exodus to 1 Kings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The temple was bigger and more solid than the tabernacle, but its purpose and function were the same.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was the type of both Christ and the church in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With the building of the temple, Jacob s dream, at least to some extent, was fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There was, on earth, a house of God built with stones on a solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was much more solid in form than was the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Its history lasted for about four hundred years, from about 1000 B.C. until it was destroyed by the Babylonians in approximately 600 B.C., and is recorded from 1 Kings to Ezra</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Building of Babylon</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In opposition to the temple with its city, Jerusalem, Satan built the city of Babylon Dan 4:28-30 , which was a bigger counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, with his army destroyed the temple of God and brought its utensils to Babylon, putting them in his temple of idols 2 Chron 36:7, 18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By this we can see how Satan has been constantly frustrating and damaging God s building as His habitation on earth.</S>
