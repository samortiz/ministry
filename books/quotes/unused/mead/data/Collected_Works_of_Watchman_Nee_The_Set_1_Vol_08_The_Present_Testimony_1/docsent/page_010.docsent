   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN'S FIRST SIN Issue No. 2 Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9, 16-17; 3:4-8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we want to see how mankind sinned the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This will serve as a warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the first sin was, so also are all the sins to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As Adam sinned, so we likewise sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sin that Adam committed is the same sin that we commit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we understand how the first sin was committed, we can understand how all the sins are committed in the world because, according to the Bible, there is only one principle concerning sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE ONE PRINCIPLE CONCERNING SIN</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With all sins, the word self is always connected to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today men divide sins into many, many categories.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is difficult to say how many millions of categories there are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in summary, there is only one sin all thought and conduct which have something to do with "self" are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, all the sins in the world, though many in number, are based on just one principle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sinning is being for the self.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the sins are due to self.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there were no self, there would be no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is pride?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Pride is nothing but the exalting of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is envy?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Envy is nothing but the intolerance of others being over the self.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why does one strive?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Striving is for the self.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why does one become angry?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is because the self has been hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is fornication?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is nothing but acting according to the self's lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is cowardice?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is nothing but caring for the self's weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are millions of other kinds of sins that we cannot enumerate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we examine each one of them, we will see that the underlying principle is always the same: every sin always has something to do with the "self."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is not a single sin that is not associated with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Where there is sin, the self must be acting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Where there is the self's activity, there is sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we examine the fruit of the Spirit, which is the virtues of the believers, we will see that they are the behavior that is apart from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is love?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Love is not caring for the self but loving others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is joy?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Joy is not looking at the self but hoping in God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Patience is ignoring the self's afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peace is not caring for the self's losses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Kindness is not remembering the self's right.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Meekness is not thinking of the self's merits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Self-control is controlling the self.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Faithfulness is to be self-regulating.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we look at all the virtues of the believers one by one, we will see that there is no virtue in a believer except what is apart from the self and not caring for the self.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is only one principle to the fruit of the Spirit complete renunciation of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have only mentioned a few sins and virtues, and we have already seen that sin is simply the pursuit of the self, while virtue is the forgetting of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have more time, we can examine the differences between all the sins and virtues in our daily living to see if their differences actually lie in their relationship with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brothers, let me tell you truly: other than "selflessness," there is no other virtue; while other than the "self," there are no other sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our self is the root of all sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE SIN COMMITTED BY ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The verses we just read tell us that there were two trees in the midst of the garden and that Adam brought sin into the world by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we want to take a look at these two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I want to use one word to represent each tree.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies independence, while the tree of life signifies dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Let us first take a look at the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The first thing we should understand is that eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil does not just involve heinous sins.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Adam did not fornicate, neither did he murder, nor did he commit many dirty sins.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He merely ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What Adam did was not a horrible sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But just by eating once of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he brought about his own fall, his descendants' fall, and caused the whole world to be filled with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although the sin committed by him was not the most defiling one, nevertheless, the most defiling sins came out of this "not-so-defiling" sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to our concept, the first sin committed by mankind, which was the mother of all the sins to follow in the world, must have been extremely defiling.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, what we see is simply a man who ate a fruit which he should not have!</S>
