<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE BELIEVERS' GROWTH IN LIFE<br>UNVEILED IN THE WRITINGS OF PAUL</H2><P>The believers' growth in life is unveiled more in the writings of Paul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Its Base</H2><P>In the writings of the three main writers of the New Testament concerning our growth in the divine life, the base unveiled in Paul's writings is the fullest and the strongest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Righteousness of God</H2><P>The gospel preached by the apostle Paul is based upon the righteousness of God (Rom. 1:17) for God's full salvation in Christ. Hence, the righteousness of God becomes the first base for the growth in the divine life of the believers, who have participated in Christ's salvation based upon God's righteousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Redemption of Christ</H2><P>Christ's complete redemption (Rom. 3:24b) is accomplished according to the requirements of God's righteousness in full and has fulfilled those requirements up to the full satisfaction of God. Hence, it becomes the most solid base for Christ's redeemed people to grow in the divine life. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Justification by God</H2><P>Based upon the complete and full redemption of Christ, God has justified all the believers in Christ (Rom. 3:24a; 8:30b) and reconciled them all to Himself in the next item. These are also solid bases for the believers in Christ to grow in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Reconciliation to God</H2><P>God has reconciled to Himself those whom He has justified in Christ based upon the redemption of Christ (Rom. 5:10a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Washing of Regeneration</H2><P>God has regenerated us following His reconciling of us to Himself to wash away the old creation from us (Titus 3:5). Both this item and the next item are vital bases for us to grow in the divine life.</P>
