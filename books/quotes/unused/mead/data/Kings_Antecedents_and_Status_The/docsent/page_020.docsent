   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. Jeconiah Begetting Salathiel,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Salathiel Begetting Zerubbabel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 1:12 says, "Jeconiah begot Salathiel; and Salathiel begot Zerubbabel."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Compare this record with that in 1 Chronicles 3:17-19, "the sons of Jeconiah...Salathiel...and Pedaiah...and the sons of Pedaiah were Zerubbabel...," showing that Zerubbabel was the son of Pedaiah, Salathiel's brother.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Zerubbabel was not Salathiel's son, but his nephew, who became his heir.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Perhaps this was a case in accordance with Deuteronomy 25:5 and 6, which say that if a man dies without a son as his heir, his brother must marry his wife in order to produce a son to be his heir.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without this case, we cannot understand why there is such a regulation in Deuteronomy 25.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even that word in Deuteronomy is related to the genealogy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Y. Zerubbabel</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ezra 5:1 and 2 say that Zerubbabel was one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from the captivity at Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that he was a leader in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was also a leader in the rebuilding of God's temple Zech 4:7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without this return from captivity, it would have been impossible for Christ to be born at Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Old Testament definitely predicted that Christ, as the descendant of David, would be born in Bethlehem Matt 2:4-6; Micah 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose none of the people of Israel had returned to Judah, and the time came for Christ to be born at Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No one would have been there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we can understand why God commanded the captives to return.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's commandment that the captives return was not only for the rebuilding of the temple but also the preparation for Christ to be born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is exactly the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some may ask, "What is the difference between remaining at Babylon and returning to Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Isn't it the same, as long as we worship God and walk in the spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It may be all right with you, but it is not all right with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ needs some people to bring Him to Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may worship God and you may walk in the spirit in Babylon, but be assured that Christ could never be born into humanity through you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This requires a specific place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must return from Babylon to Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the time came for the Lord Jesus to be born, some Israelites, descendants of the returned captives, were waiting in Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time, Joseph and Mary were not in Babylon; they were in Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For Christ to come to earth, some of His captured people had to return.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For His second coming, Christ also needs some of His captured people to return from their captivity to the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Z. Jacob Begetting Joseph</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The genealogy here says, "Jacob begot Joseph" Matt 1:16 , but Luke 3:23 says, "Joseph, which was the son of Heli."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whose son was Joseph?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Luke's record says "as to the law" literal translation of "as was supposed" in Luke 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that Joseph was not actually the son of Heli, but was reckoned as his son according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Joseph was the son-in-law of Heli, Mary's father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This might have been a case according to Numbers 27:1-8 and 36:1-12, in which a regulation was made by God that if any parents had only daughters as heirs, their inheritance should go to the daughters; the daughters then must marry a man of their own tribe in order to keep their inheritance within that tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we did not have Matthew chapter one we may wonder why such a record exists.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we see that this is not merely the record of a certain regulation; it is a matter related to Christ, because the virgin daughter who brought forth Christ was such a case.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We believe that Mary's parents had no sons and that she inherited her parents' heritage and married Joseph, a man of the same tribe, the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even the regulation in Numbers 27 and 36 is related to the genealogy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Either directly or indirectly the whole Bible is a record of Christ.</S>
