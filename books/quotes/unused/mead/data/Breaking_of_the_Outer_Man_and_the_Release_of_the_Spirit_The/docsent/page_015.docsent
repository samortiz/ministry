   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT USING AN OUTER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT IS BROKEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As soon as our outer man is bound, our spirit becomes bound as well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spirit cannot bypass the outer man to operate in others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God never bypasses man's spirit when His Spirit works in man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nor does God allow our spirit to bypass our outer man when it operates in others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a very important principle, and we must be clear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Holy Spirit never works on man apart from man, and our spirit can never work on man apart from our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our spirit must pass through our outer man before it can operate in others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever our outer man is occupied by "things in the hands" and has exhausted its strength, we cannot participate in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If our spirit does not have a way to go on, the Holy Spirit does not have a way to go on either.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The outer man can block the way of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The outer man can frustrate the inner man and prevent it from coming out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason that we repeatedly emphasize the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once the outer man has things in its hands, the inner man has no way to break out, and God's work is frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Things in the hands refer to things which are present before God's work comes into view.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, things in the hands are things that are unrelated to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These things are perpetuated without God's command, power, or ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are not under God's hand; rather, they are independent entities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has to break the outer man before He can use the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has to break our love before He can use our love to love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the outer man is not broken, we are still doing our own things, taking our own way, and loving our own preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God must first break our outer man before He can use our "broken" love to love the brothers and before our love can be expanded.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once the outer man is broken, the inner man is released.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The inner man must love, but it must love through the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the outer man has things in its hands, the inner man will have nothing to work through.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our will is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not only strong; it is also stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When our inner man needs the will, it cannot find it, because our will has been moving too independently and has too many things in its hands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has to give us a heavy blow; He has to smash our will and humble us so much that we are forced to say, with our face in the dust, "Lord, I dare not think.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I dare not ask.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I dare not decide.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I need You in everything."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be so smitten that our will can no longer act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only then can the inner man take hold of the will and use it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the outer man is not available, the inner man will be unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Can we preach God's word if we do not have a physical body?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can we preach without a mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is true that one needs the spirit to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But preaching also requires one's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What can a person do if he only has a spirit but not a mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At Pentecost there was the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But at Pentecost there was also the dispensing of the gift of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without utterance one does not have the word to release and explain God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If man does not speak, God has no speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man's word certainly is not God's word, but God's word is conveyed through man's word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If man does not speak, there will be no word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There must be man's word before there can be God's word.</S>
