   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ONES CHOSEN AND CALLED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>NEEDING TO BELIEVE INTO JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ones who have been chosen and called by God need to believe into Jesus Christ, who is the incarnated God, who died, resurrected, and ascended for us and with us, and who became the life-giving Spirit as the pneumatic Christ to us, that He may be our salvation, life, and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is revealed in the New Testament, in the books from Matthew through Romans.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TO BE THE NEW MAN AS GOD'S NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As believers in Christ, we need to grow in the divine life of Christ that we may be transformed into what Christ is through the life-dispensing Spirit, that we may be built up with the saints to be the Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God in Christ, and to be the new man as God's new creation to carry out God's eternal economy in the consummation of the New Jerusalem as the mingling of the processed Triune God with the glorified tripartite man, to be the corporate God-man's manifestation in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is revealed in the New Testament, from 1 Corinthians through Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>VIII.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>WITH THE NATURAL HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such a regenerated, transformed, and glorified saint in Christ has nothing to do with the natural man and does not need to build up himself with the natural human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If Job and his friends had lived at the time to know this, they would have been saved from their time-wasting, pain-increasing, and vain debates in thirty-five chapters as a record of a group of blind persons groping in darkness.</S>
