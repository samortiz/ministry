<p>As long as we are willing to practice according to this fellowship, we will overcome. Every morning we need to call, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; It is not difficult to call on the name of the Lord. The Lord has done all the difficult work; He was crucified, bore our sins, and accomplished redemption for us. He was buried in the tomb, entered into Hades, and walked out of Hades for us. He also resurrected and ascended into heaven for us. He has accomplished this for us. He is the processed Triune God consummated as the life-giving Spirit. The God who created the heavens and the earth in Genesis 1:1 became breath in John 20. The Lord Jesus breathed into the disciples and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). This indicates that the Lord is the Spirit. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; As the last Adam, the Lord became a life-giving Spirit through the processes of incarnation, death, and resurrection. This life-giving Spirit is just like air. Hence, we can call on Him and breathe Him in, that is, receive Him. Romans 10:13 says, &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved,&rdquo; and verse 12 says that the Lord is &ldquo;rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; When we call on Him, we are saved, and we enjoy Him.</p>
<p>If we would practice calling on the Lord in our daily living, we would live an overcoming life, and we would walk according to the spirit in all things, whether great or small. Our being happy because our spouse is rejoicing should be according to the spirit, and our being unhappy because our spouse is not rejoicing should also be according to the spirit. This is an overcoming life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living a Fruit-bearing Life</h2>
<p>The Lord has appointed us to bear fruit, and our destiny is to bear fruit. Living an overcoming life is the means for us to bear fruit. Our living must be to go forth to bear fruit. If we do not visit our neighbors and preach the gospel to them, we are indebted to them (1 Cor. 9:16; Rom. 1:14). We do not have any excuse. We also need to spread the gospel gradually to surrounding areas. This is a long-term matter. We cannot depend on so-called Christian revivals.</p>
<p>None of the revivals in Christianity has lasted for a long period. The most famous revival was the great Welsh Revival, which began around 1905. This revival was so prevailing that there was hardly an unsaved person in Wales during this time. However, that revival did not last longer than fifteen years. Today Wales is like any other heathen country. So-called revivals do not last. The revival that I am referring to in this fellowship is the revival that comes from fellowship with the Lord daily by drawing near to Him, walking according to the spirit daily, and living an overcoming life daily. Such a revival will last.</p>
<p>We need to be specific and set apart two to three hours every week to go out door-to-door to visit people. If we are willing to practice this, I can guarantee that we will gain four people in one year, and they will be reliable. According to the principle in Matthew 13, even if only one out of four persons is reliable, the church will increase onefold yearly. Because some saints are elderly, some are sick, and some have other situations, only half the saints in a locality might be able to go out and knock on doors to visit people. Or perhaps only one-fourth of the saints can go out. We cannot increase if no one is willing to go out. However, if we are willing to take this way, the church will have a fifty-percent rate of increase. This means that if there are one hundred people meeting today, next year there will be one hundred fifty, and the third year there will be two hundred twenty-five. In this way, the whole world can be saved in twenty-five to thirty years.</p>
<p>The problem is not on the Lord&rsquo;s side but on our side. It depends on whether or not we are willing. The truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is very clear, and our way is also clear. The question is whether or not we would cooperate with the Lord. This is not a short-term revival or a gospel festival. The human life does not depend on festivals. Although festivals are good and are an encouragement, for the long run we need to live a normal life. Our practice must not depend on festivals, because when the feasts are over, everything ends. We must continue steadfastly, just as we live our daily life.</p>
<p>Recently during the gospel festival in the churches in the San Gabriel Valley, over one hundred thirty people came from the church in San Francisco and were revived. I hope that such a revival will continue. However, after we are revived, we should not try to go out to knock on doors and gain twenty people in one day. It is more than enough if we gain one person per week. There are fifty-two weeks in a year. If we go out weekly to knock on doors, we will gain people, and we should begin to take care of them every week. This is the way for the church to have at least a fifty-percent rate of increase. Moreover, those who are added to the church will not be unreliable; rather, they will stand firm. After two years these new ones will also be able to go out and knock on doors to lead others to be saved. This is the definite way to practice preaching the gospel.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Proper Way for Believers to Meet and to Serve &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
