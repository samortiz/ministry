How good it is that You have gathered us together to meet You not only with the Word but as the Word, to meet You as the Spirit, to meet You as all the saints, and to meet You as the church, the Body of Christ. Lord, we believe that You have something on Your heart. We look unto You, Lord. Open up Yourself to us. You are ready. By Your mercy we are also ready. We come here to meet You, to touch Your heart, and to see what is on Your heart. Lord, we look unto You for You to visit us. We are open to You, Lord. We open up our heart. We open up our spirit. We open up our entire being to You. We want to gain You. Lord, do grant us Yourself. Cleanse us with Your precious blood and defeat Your enemy. Lord, chase him away from here. Bind him and destroy him. Strengthen us. We need You. Amen.</P><P>Since we have released the high peak of God's divine revelation, my burden is that we need to see the practicality and the reality of living a life according to this high peak. We do not just want to have a so-called seeing of the high peak, without taking care of touching it and entering into it. This is my burden today.</P><P>The burden of these messages can be expressed in the following four statements:</P><P>1. To be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection&#151;Phil. 3:10.<br>2. To live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&#151;Phil. 1:19b-21a.<br>3. To be conformed to the image of God's Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers&#151;Rom. 8:29.<br>4. To build up the Body of Christ by growing into Him, the Head, in all things&#151;Eph. 4:15-16.</P><P>The general subject is: "The Practical Way to Live a Life according to the High Peak of the Divine Revelation in the Holy Scriptures." This general subject contains a number of crucial points, and we need to get into them. The title of this first message is: "To Have a Clear View concerning the Accomplishments of the Processed and Consummated Triune God (A Crystallization-study of the Holy Scriptures)." Over the past twenty-one years, we have had the life-study of the Scriptures. But since the beginning of this year, I have had the burden to go on to have another category of the study of the holy Scriptures. This category is the crystallization-study of the Scriptures.</P><P>In the outline of this message, there are altogether forty points: nine main points and thirty-one subpoints. I am presenting all these points to give us a clear view of what our God, the processed and consummated Triune God, has done and is still doing in the universe. I am presenting these points with all the Scripture references in a crystallization way for you to get into them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. HEAVENLY, SPIRITUAL, MYSTERIOUS,<br>MARVELOUS, EXCELLENT, DIVINE<br>AND HUMAN AS WELL</H2><P>The accomplishments of the processed and consummated Triune God, everything He has done and is doing for us, are heavenly, spiritual, mysterious, marvelous, excellent, divine and human as well.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. FOR THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST<br>IN THE NEW CREATION OF GOD</H2><P>Whatever God has done and is doing is all for the organic Body of Christ in God's new creation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. FOR THE CARRYING OUT<br>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT<br>ECONOMY OF GOD</H2><P>All the accomplishments of the processed and consummated Triune God are for the carrying out of His New Testament economy. The first major thing God accomplished for the carrying out of His economy was incarnation. Then He passed through human living, He accomplished an all-inclusive death, He carried out an all-conquering resurrection, and He entered into an all-transcending ascension. These are the five categories, or five steps, of God's move: incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. INCARNATION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Bring God into Man<br>by Having God Incarnated to Be<br>a Man in the Flesh</H2><P>God's incarnation (John 1:14) was clearly promised and prophesied in the Old Testament, but regretfully, most of the Jews never saw it. In Genesis 3:15 God promised the fallen Adam that a seed of the woman would come to bruise the head of the evil serpent, who seduced Adam to fall. No doubt, Adam by that time hated that serpent. So God told him that one day a seed of the woman would come to bruise that serpent's head. We know this seed of the woman is Christ. One day He was born of a virgin. He destroyed Satan. He bruised the head of Satan.</P><P>In Genesis 22:18 God promised Abraham that his seed would be the blessing to all the nations on earth. Abraham's seed is Christ (Gal. 3:16). In 2 Samuel 7:12-14 God promised David that his seed, a human being, would be the Son of God to build God's temple and to sit on the throne in God's kingdom. This seed is also Christ.</P><P>Thus, we see three seeds&#151;the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David. The seed of the woman would bruise the head of Satan, the seed of Abraham would become a blessing to all the nations on the earth, and the seed of David would be the Son of God to build up the temple and to rule in God's kingdom.</P><P>Isaiah prophesies that a virgin would be with child and bear a son. Isaiah 7:14 says that this virgin's child would be called Emmanuel, God with us. Isaiah 9:6 says that unto us a child is born and a son is given, yet His name shall be called the Mighty God, the Eternal Father. Micah 5:2 prophesies that a ruler would come forth from Bethlehem whose goings forth are from of old, from the days of eternity.</P><P>These are the prophecies concerning Christ. In total, all these promises and prophecies indicated that one day God would come to be a man, to bring Himself into man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Mingle Divinity with Humanity</H2><P>God's becoming a man means that God mingles divinity with humanity, making God and man, divinity and humanity, one entity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Be Born of the Divine Spirit<br>and of a Human Virgin</H2><P>Christ was conceived of the divine Spirit and was born of a human virgin (Matt. 1:20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To Produce a God-man</H2><P>The birth of Christ produced a God-man&#151;Emmanuel (Matt. 1:23)&#151;as the prototype for the mass reproduction of many God-men. God became Jesus. That means God became a God-man. This God-man is a prototype to reproduce millions of God-men. If you realize that you are a God-man, you will conduct yourself in your daily life in a way of dignity. When you go shopping to buy food or in anything you do in your practical affairs, you should consider yourself a God-man. Then your attitude and the way that you talk will be full of dignity. Even a mayor of a small city does things with his dignity. Today you are a God-man, who should live a life fully dignified, with the highest standard of human virtues expressing the most excellent divine attributes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. PASSING THROUGH HUMAN LIVING<br>FOR THIRTY-THREE AND A HALF YEARS</H2><P>The second great accomplishment of the processed and consummated Triune God was His passing through human living for thirty-three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Living a Human Life to Express<br>the Divine Attributes as Human Virtues</H2><P>One day God became a man on this earth. Then this God-man lived a human life on earth to express not anything human but the divine attributes as human virtues, thus expressing God in humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By Living a Crucified Human Life</H2><P>Christ passed through human living by living a crucified human life to express the divine life. Today we are the reproduction of this prototype. We are the God-men. We need to realize that our living must be a crucified living. We should always put our human life to death. This is to crucify our human life. This is for the purpose of expressing the divine life. Our human life has to be crucified so that the divine life, which is ours also, can be expressed. In this way we are dying to live, that is, we are dying to ourselves to live to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Set Up a Model for the Many<br>Upcoming God-men</H2><P>The processed and consummated Triune God passed through human living to set up a model for the many upcoming God-men&#151;being crucified to live that God might be expressed through humanity. This is clearly unveiled in 1 Peter 2:21, which tells us that Christ in His human living left us a model, an example, for us to copy. Christ Jesus, while He was on this earth, set up a copy for spiritual xeroxing. He was the model, the copy, for xeroxing, to produce millions of copies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Crucifying the Flesh of Sin</H2><P>On the cross Christ died an all-inclusive death. The first thing He dealt with in His death was our flesh. He crucified the flesh of sin (Gal. 5:24; Rom. 8:3b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Condemning Sin</H2><P>Christ condemned sin (sin is in the flesh [Rom. 7:18] and Christ was made sin by becoming the flesh of sin in its likeness [2 Cor. 5:21a]) and took away sin (including sins) by shedding His blood (Rom. 8:3b; John 1:29; Heb. 9:26b, 28a; John 19:34b). God as righteousness is embodied in Christ; Satan as sin is embodied in the flesh. God is in Christ, and Satan is in the flesh. On the cross Christ dealt with both the flesh and sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Destroying the Devil</H2><P>In His all-inclusive death Christ destroyed the devil, who has the might of death and who is related to the flesh of sin (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Judging the World and Casting Out<br>Its Ruler, the Devil</H2><P>Four things are related to one another: the flesh, sin, Satan, and the world. Christ in His death judged the world and cast out its ruler, the devil (John 12:31; Gal. 6:14b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Crucifying the Old Man</H2><P>Christ also crucified the old man (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20a; 6:14b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Terminating the Old Creation</H2><P>Christ terminated the old creation by the crucifixion of the old man (Rom. 6:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Abolishing the Law<br>of the Commandments in Ordinances</H2><P>On the cross Christ abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances (Eph. 2:15a). The ordinances are the human forms or ways of living and worship. These ordinances divide people, so Christ abolished them in His death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Releasing the Divine Life</H2><P>In Christ's death He dealt with seven negative points: the flesh, sin, Satan, the world, the old man, the old creation, and the ordinances in the law. There is a positive point to His death. In His death He also released the divine life from the one grain into many grains, signified by the flowing of water at the death of Christ (John 12:24; 19:34b). When He was crucified, His side was pierced and out flowed blood and water. Blood is for redemption to deal with sins for the purchasing of the church (Acts 20:28). Water is for imparting life to deal with death for the producing of the church (Eph. 5:29-30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE ALL-CONQUERING RESURRECTION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Producing the Firstborn Son of God</H2><P>In the all-conquering resurrection the firstborn Son of God was produced. God had only one Son, the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18; 3:16). But in resurrection another kind of Son of God was produced, the firstborn Son of God. This took place in resurrection by uplifting the humanity of Christ into His divinity and by having Christ born of God (Acts 13:33; Psa. 2:7), that is, by designating the seed of David by the divinity (the Spirit of holiness) of Christ in the power of resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 1:4; 8:29; Heb. 1:3-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Regenerating All God's Chosen People<br>to Be the Many Sons of God</H2><P>In Christ's all-conquering resurrection all of God's chosen people were regenerated to be the many sons of God and the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God&#151;the resurrected God-man, Christ (1 Pet. 1:3; Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Consummating the Spirit of God<br>to Be the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>Christ first became a man, and that man was born to be God's firstborn Son. Also, millions of God's chosen people were born with Him to be God's many sons. In the same resurrection, this wonderful Christ also became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The life-giving Spirit is the Spirit of Christ&#151;the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatized Christ (Rom. 8:9). The life-giving Spirit is also the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, who is embodied in the pneumatized Christ realized as the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is the reality of resurrection, which is Christ Himself and the processed and consummated Triune God (John 11:25; 1 John 5:6). The resurrection is Christ and the consummated Triune God. And this resurrection is the Spirit.</P><P>We need to see that in the all-conquering resurrection of Christ, three major things transpired. First, the man Jesus was born to be the firstborn Son of God. Second, all His believers were born in that birth with Him to be the many sons of God. One delivery produced the firstborn Son and millions of "twins." We are the "twins" of Christ. We are His "twin" brothers, born by one delivery. Of course, He took the lead to come out, and we followed Him. First Peter 1:3 says that all the believers in Christ were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ. Third, at the time when Christ in His humanity was born to be the firstborn Son of God, He became the life-giving Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE ALL-TRANSCENDING ASCENSION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Transcending Four Layers of Opposition</H2><P>Christ in His ascension transcended Hades (where the dead people are being held), the earth (where the fallen men are moving against God), the air (where Satan and his power of darkness are acting against God), and all the heavens (where Satan can go). Christ transcended these four layers (Eph. 1:20-21; 4:8-10; Heb. 4:14; 7:26). Hades is the first layer, below the earth where the dead people are held. The earth is where the fallen men are moving against God. The air is where Satan and his power of darkness are struggling against God. The third heaven is a good place, but Satan even has a way to go to that good place (Job 1:6-12a; 2:1-6). In Christ's ascension He transcended these four layers. Today He is not only above Hades, the earth, and the air, but also above the third heaven. He is higher than all the heavens.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Be Transmitted into the Church</H2><P>Such a transcending Christ is to be transmitted into the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Be the Head of the Body, the Church</H2><P>In His ascension He is the Head of the Body, the church, having the first place in all things (Col. 1:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To Be Made Lord, Christ, Leader, and Savior</H2><P>In His ascension this One was made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36) and the Leader (of all the kings) and Savior (5:31). If He were not the Ruler, the Leader, of all the kings, He could not be the Savior. He is the Ruler of all the kings, so He can manage the environment for all of God's chosen people to be saved. I was saved in China. If in history God had not managed the world affairs to have some saints from the West go to the Far East to preach the gospel, I could never have been saved. For the British and Americans to go to my country to preach the gospel needed much work by God. That was a great management. Sometimes the management is small, but only God can carry this out to create the proper environment for people to be saved. Thus, He is the Ruler of all the kings so that He can be the Savior to save God's chosen people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. To Be Our High Priest<br>in God's New Testament Economy</H2><P>Christ is our High Priest in God's New Testament economy to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs (Heb. 4:14; 7:26; 9:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. To Be the Mediator of the New Covenant</H2><P>In His ascension Christ has become the Mediator, the Executor, of the new covenant, the new testament, which He bequeathed to us by His death (Heb. 8:6; 9:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. To Be the Surety of the Better Covenant</H2><P>Christ is also the surety, the pledge that everything in the new covenant will be fulfilled (Heb. 7:22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. To Be the Minister<br>in the Heavenly Holy of Holies</H2><P>Christ is the Minister in the heavenly Holy of Holies to minister heaven (which is not only a place but also a condition of life) into us that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth, as He did when He was here (Heb. 8:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. To Be the Paraclete (Advocate)<br>of the New Testament Believers</H2><P>In His ascension Christ is the Paraclete (Advocate) of the New Testament believers (1 John 2:1; John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. To Be the New Testament Believers'<br>Intercessor at the Right Hand of God<br>and within Them As Well</H2><P>Christ is the New Testament believers' Intercessor at the right hand of God and within them as well (Rom. 8:34, 26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. ALL THESE EXCELLENT, DIVINE, AND HUMAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS BEING FOR THE PRODUCING AND BUILDING UP OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>All these excellent, divine, and human accomplishments are for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as the expansion and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in humanity for eternity (Eph. 1:23; 4:12, 16; Rev. 21:1&#151;22:5).</P><P>The outline and the fellowship in this chapter are worthy of our study. We need to get into the accomplishments of the Triune God from His incarnation through His human living, His death, and His resurrection to His ascension. The accomplishments of the processed and consummated Triune God are the real content of the Bible. They are for the purpose of making God man so that the many men chosen by God can be made God in His life and in His nature but not in His Godhead, so that God and man can be constituted together as one entity. This one entity is the organic Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TO BE CONFORMED TO THE DEATH<br>OF CHRIST BY THE POWER<br>OF HIS RESURRECTION</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Phil. 3:10</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The life of Christ, the first God-man, on the earth:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Being both God and man, having the divine life and the human life.</li>	<li>Living a life of humanity, not by His human life, but by His divine life.</li>	<li>Dying to Himself but living to the Father&#151;John 5:19, 30; 8:28.</li>	<li>Dying to live out the divine attributes as His human virtues.</li>	<li>Expressing not Himself but the Father under the cross all the time in His life on the earth.</li>	<li>Until being practically crucified on the cross to accomplish His all-inclusive death for God's eternal redemption of His chosen people.</li>	<li>Making Himself, the first God-man, a prototype for the mass reproduction of many brothers&#151;many God-men&#151;Rom. 8:29.</li>	</ol></li><li>The believers in Christ as His brothers the many God-men needing to live:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>A life as a copy of the life of Christ the first God-man&#151;1 Pet. 2:21a.</li>	<li>Bearing the cross in the steps of Christ&#151;Matt. 16:24; 1 Pet. 2:21b.</li>	<li>Dying to themselves and living to God&#151;2 Cor. 5:15; Gal. 2:19.</li>	<li>Crucified with Christ to be conformed to His death by the power of His resurrection&#151;Gal. 2:20; Phil. 3:10.</li>	<li>Putting to death the practices of the body by the Spirit in resurrection&#151;Rom. 8:13.</li>	<li>For Christ, the first God-man, to be formed in His many brothers&#151;the many God-men&#151;for the building up of His organic Body that the eternal economy of God might be carried out.</li>	<li>Thus, a number of His brothers, the many God-men, through His death and in His resurrection may be constituted to be His overcomers to close this age and bring in His kingdom age.</li>	</ol></li></ol><P>Philippians 3:10 says, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death." This verse unveils three items which Paul wanted to know. First, Paul wanted to know Him. Second, he wanted to know the power of His resurrection. Third, he wanted to know the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</P><P>We want to see the practical way to live a life according to the high peak of the divine revelation, which is not out of man's imagination but in the Holy Scriptures. This high peak is that God became man that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. The eternal, infinite, self-existing, ever-existing, and almighty God one day became a man, like you and me. The human race has a history of about six thousand years, from the creation of Adam to our time. God became a man only about two thousand years ago.</P><P>About four thousand years before God became a man, He created man in His image and after His likeness (Gen. 1:26). Man is in the image of God and after the likeness of God. Suppose a little boy made a clay toy in the image and likeness of a lion. When the little boy's friend saw it, he would say, "You have made a lion." Surely that is a real toy, but it is in the image of a lion. God made a real man according to His kind, not according to man's kind. Actually, man in himself has no kind. Mankind is "Godkind." One day God shaped some clay in His own image and after His own likeness. That man was according to God's kind. We human beings are in God's kind.</P><P>After His creation of man He did not do anything to mingle Himself with man for four thousand years. But He did promise mankind that a threefold seed would come: the seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15), the seed of Abraham (22:18), and the seed of David (2 Sam. 7:12-14). The seed of the woman would bruise the head of Satan, the seed of Abraham would be a blessing to all the nations on earth, and the seed of David would build up God's temple and set up God's kingdom. In the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 these three seeds are one person, Christ.</P><P>There is also a prophecy in the Old Testament saying that a virgin would be with child and bear a son (Isa. 7:14). This is the fulfillment of the promise of the seed of the woman. Isaiah said that this human son, this human child, is called the Mighty God and the Eternal Father (9:6). That is God Himself. Thus, the threefold seed is God Himself. God is divine, and the threefold seed is human. This indicates that the divine God would become a human seed, a man. Micah 5:2 says that out of Bethlehem would come forth a ruler, whose goings forth are of old, from the days of eternity. We can see such a record in the Old Testament, but after God created man in His kind, He did not do anything for His New Testament economy for four thousand years. Within these four thousand years, He promised and prophesied that He would come to be a man.</P><P>In the whole universe there was God, there were the angels, there were men, but there had never been a God-man. One day an extraordinary event took place. Jesus was born. He is both God and man, the God-man. God became a man by the name of Jesus. This God-man became the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29), and the firstborn Son indicates, no doubt, that many brothers will follow. In eternity before God created man, He had chosen millions of men to be His many sons (Eph. 1:4-5). Today our being the many sons of God is not based upon creation, but based upon God's selection, God's choosing.</P><P>He chose us in eternity past, and one day He regenerated us. He regenerated us on the same day Jesus was born to be the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). In His resurrection we were born to be the many sons of God. This indicates that the firstborn Son is a prototype, and the many sons are the mass reproduction. What should we as the reproduction of the firstborn Son of God be? We should be the God-men. He was the first God-man, the prototype. He was the original copy for xeroxing, and we are the following copies. We should be exactly the same as He is. He is a God-man, and we should be the God-men.</P><P>God desired to become a man, and one day He became a man, living on earth as a God-man. Yet when He lived on earth as the God-man, He did not live by His human life, but by His divine life. He was divine. He wanted to become human, and He was human. Yet He lived a human life not by His humanity, but by His divinity. He was a human being that came with divinity. He lived on this earth not only as God but also as man. He lived as a God-man, yet not by the life of man but by the life of God. So His human living was not lived out by the human life but by the divine life. Yet within the divine life, there was the element of humanity, and within the human life, there was the element of divinity. The divine attributes became the human virtues.</P><P>Caesar Augustus (Luke 2:1) was the first formal Caesar of the Roman Empire, who took possession of the land where this God-man lived. This God-man's living under the Roman Empire is a part of human history. He lived by always rejecting His human life, by always putting His human life under the cross. From the first day He lived on earth, He was crucified. He lived a crucified human life, not by His human life, but by His divine life. His human living did not express humanity but divinity in the divine attributes becoming the human virtues. This is what Paul meant in 1 Timothy 3 when he spoke of Christ as God manifested in the flesh (v. 16).</P><P>Many Christians know that one day God was incarnated to be a man by the name of Jesus. They know this just in black and white, but sorry to say, they do not know the intrinsic fact of this incarnation. This incarnation produced a God-man, who lived on the earth not by His human life but by His divine life. All the days when He was on earth, He put Himself on the cross. He remained on the cross to die that He might live by God, not to express man but to express God in His divine attributes becoming man's virtues. This was the life of the first God-man as a prototype. Today we are His reproduction, His many copies, so we should live the same kind of life.</P><P>I was born in Christianity. From my youth I was taught that we have to follow Jesus. What they meant, however, was this: "Jesus loves people, so we have to follow Him in loving people. Jesus was meek and patient, so we have to follow Jesus in meekness and in patience." Apparently, this teaching is right, but intrinsically, it is absolutely off. Intrinsically speaking, to follow Jesus is to be a xerox copy of that first God-man. To follow Jesus is to live the life of a God-man, not by the human life but by the divine life, so that God may be expressed or manifested in the flesh in all His divine attributes becoming the human virtues. This is the intrinsic significance of what it is to follow Christ. So the practical way to live a life according to the high peak of the divine revelation is that you must be a God-man. As a God-man you need to live a life not by yourself but by another One, not by your human life but by His divine life, not to express yourself but to express His divinity in His divine attributes which all become your human virtues.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE LIFE OF CHRIST, THE FIRST GOD-MAN,<br>ON THE EARTH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being Both God and Man,<br>Having the Divine Life and the Human Life</H2><P>First, we need to be clear about the life of Christ, the first God-man, on the earth. He was both God and man, having the divine life and the human life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Living a Life of Humanity,<br>Not by His Human Life, but by His Divine Life</H2><P>Christ lived a life of humanity, not by His human life, but by His divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Dying to Himself but Living to the Father</H2><P>He died to live. He was dying every day during His whole life of thirty-three and a half years. He died to Himself that He might live to the Father (John 5:19, 30; 8:28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Dying to Live Out the Divine Attributes<br>as His Human Virtues</H2><P>I like this phrase dying to live. Christ died to Himself in order to live out the divine attributes as His human virtues.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Expressing Not Himself but the Father under the Cross All the Time in His Life on the Earth</H2><P>Christ was under the cross all the time on the earth, expressing not Himself but the Father. One day Philip asked Him, "Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us" (John 14:8). The Lord responded, "Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?" (v. 9). The disciples saw the Lord Jesus, but when they saw Him, they saw the Father. This shows that He was the expression of the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Until Being Practically Crucified on the Cross</H2><P>Christ lived a life under the cross all the time until He was practically crucified on the cross to accomplish His all-inclusive death for God's eternal redemption of His chosen people. God's chosen people became fallen and lost, but He redeemed them back through the wonderful death of that wonderful Person, Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Making Himself, the First God-man,<br>a Prototype for the Mass Reproduction<br>of Many Brothers&#151;Many God-men</H2><P>Christ made Himself, the first God-man, a prototype for the mass reproduction of many brothers&#151;the many God-men (Rom. 8:29). I have been a Christian for about sixty-nine years. After so many years, I have been made by God to know only one thing&#151;God became man so that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. This is my unique burden, my unique message. God and man will become one entity, and that one entity is the mingling of divinity with humanity. This mingling will consummate in the New Jerusalem, which is the conclusion of the entire Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE BELIEVERS IN CHRIST AS HIS BROTHERS<br>THE MANY GOD-MEN NEEDING TO LIVE:</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Life as a Copy of the Life of Christ<br>the First God-man</H2><P>First Peter 2:21 says that Christ as the first God-man was a model for us. We need to live a life which is a copy, a reproduction, of the life of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Bearing the Cross in the Steps of Christ</H2><P>In Matthew 16:24 the Lord said, "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me." This is to live a life of bearing the cross in the steps of Christ (1 Pet. 2:21b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Dying to Themselves and Living to God</H2><P>Both 2 Corinthians 5:15 and Galatians 2:19 show that the believers in Christ should die to themselves and live to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Crucified with Christ to Be Conformed<br>to His Death by the Power of His Resurrection</H2><P>Paul said that he was crucified with Christ (Gal. 2:20) to be conformed to His death by the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Putting to Death the Practices of the Body<br>by the Spirit in Resurrection</H2><P>Romans 8:13 says, "For if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live." You have to put to death by the Spirit in His resurrection whatever your body does. This is to be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection. No one in his natural life can put everything that his body does to death. But we, the God-men, who are the reproduction of the prototype, can. We can know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. For Christ, the First God-man,<br>to Be Formed in His Many Brothers</H2><P>Such a life of dying to ourselves and living to God is for Christ, the first God-man, to be formed in His many brothers, the many God-men, for the building up of His organic Body that the eternal economy of God might be carried out. The Christian life is not a matter of outwardly loving people or of being meek or patient in our human ethics. We need to die every day (1 Cor. 15:31). The married saints need to die to their spouse. The students need to die to their classmates and teachers. We need to die to live so that the many God-men can become the building material for the building up of the Body of Christ to carry out God's eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Constituted to Be His Overcomers</H2><P>Thus, a number (not all) of His brothers, the many God-men, through His death and in His resurrection may be constituted to be His overcomers to close this age and to bring in His kingdom age. This is the real meaning of our being a Christian. It is a life of dying every day. We must admit that we have not been that absolute or faithful in practicing this dying-to-live life. God has opened up to us the high peak of His divine revelation. He also puts us in an environment of sufferings to force us to die to live. I hope we all would be brought into the reality of Philippians 3:10: "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE UNVEILED TRUTH OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION FOR THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF GOD'S ECONOMY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3; 1 Cor. 15:45b</H1><P>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that we have been caught by Your mercy and grace to be Your seekers pursuing You according to what the Scripture reveals to us. Lord, save us, rescue us, and deliver us from our natural concept, from any kind of philosophical idea, and even the more from the blinding, the covering, the veil, we have received from the teachings of today's Christianity. This morning we are here looking unto You for Your mercy to take the veils, layer by layer, away from us. Lord, bring us into the intrinsic revelation of Your holy Word. We do not want to skate on the surface of the ice any longer. We want to get into the depths of Your revelation so that we may see all the intrinsic significances of Your heart unveiled in Your holy Word. O Lord, be merciful to us. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE LAYERS OF VEILS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING<br>OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</H2><P>Before we come to the third and fourth outlines for this conference, I have a deep feeling that I need to fellowship with you intimately concerning the understanding of the holy Scriptures.</P><P>According to my experience and observations, nearly all of us Christians today understand the Bible according to three things. The first thing is our natural concept. God has created us as very thoughtful people. We all have a wonderful mind. Out from this wonderful mind, we all have our natural concept. The first time you read the Bible, you understood it according to your natural concept. You imagined that was what the Bible meant, but actually it was not. That was what you understood according to your natural concept.</P><P>The second thing according to which people understand the Bible is their human philosophy. Human history has produced many philosophies. The Chinese, the Greeks, the Jews, the Arabs, the Indians from India, and the Japanese all have their particular philosophies. The Americans are the most modern people, and they have their kind of modern American philosophy. England, Germany, and France are close geographically, but the difference is great among their particular philosophies. It is very difficult for anyone to understand the Bible without unconsciously being under a philosophy.</P><P>The third thing that affects our understanding of the Bible is the teaching of today's Christianity. I am not referring to the heretical teachings, but to the fundamental, scriptural, right teachings. I was under that kind of teaching for years. Even today, I still say there was nothing wrong with that teaching, but the understanding from that kind of fundamental teaching covered me, veiled me, from seeing the intrinsic significances of the Bible.</P><P>Through the years, by the Lord's mercy, we have been rescued from these three layers of veils. When I come to the Word of God today, my realization is absolutely different from my realization sixty years ago. This is because sixty years ago I understood the holy Word according to the fundamental teachings I heard from the Brethren. But through many years, the Lord has been merciful to me. Gradually, year by year, through over sixty years, the Lord has brought me to a state of understanding and interpreting His Word according to the leading of the Holy Spirit to see the intrinsic significances of all the verses concerning the items of God's eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INTRINSIC SIGNIFICANCE<br>OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</H2><P>Let us consider the truth of the resurrection of Christ as an illustration. This is very common among Christians. Every Christian can say that resurrection is to be raised up or to rise up from the dead. But we need to see that resurrection implies three big things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Birth of the Firstborn Son of God</H2><P>First, in resurrection, Christ was born to be the firstborn Son of God. How many have ever heard that resurrection was a birth to Christ? Who has ever thought that besides the incarnation, Christ had another birth in His resurrection?</P><P>Acts 13:33 says, "That God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, `You are My Son; today I have begotten You.'" Today in this verse was the day of resurrection. Christ was begotten by God in resurrection to be God's firstborn Son. How many Christians have heard this truth? But this truth is in the Bible. Christ was the only begotten Son of God even before His incarnation (John 1:18). His incarnation was the coming of the only begotten Son of God (3:16). This Son of God was incarnated to be a man. But Acts 13:33 unveils that in resurrection God begot Christ to be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers (Rom. 8:29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Regeneration of the Many Sons of God</H2><P>Also, the Bible tells us that we, the God-chosen people, were regenerated in Christ's resurrection. First Peter 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ. In resurrection God begot a Son, Jesus Christ, and in resurrection God regenerated many sons. This shows us that the resurrection of Christ was a great delivery. In that same delivery, the Firstborn was Christ, and this firstborn Brother had many "twins" to follow Him. In the unique resurrection Christ was born and we were regenerated, so we were His "twins" in the same delivery.</P><P>Although this is in the Bible, who has seen it or even heard it? I can never deny this truth. This is like saying that I can never deny America because I am here in America. According to our natural idea, we were regenerated on a specific date in time after Christ's resurrection. But the Bible tells us that we were regenerated when Christ was resurrected. What a difference there is between the natural understanding and the unveiled truth!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Last Adam Becoming a Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>Now we come to the third great thing accomplished in Christ's resurrection. We have seen that in the same resurrection, Christ was born to be the firstborn Son of God, and we the God-chosen people were born to be the many sons of God, who are the "twins" of Christ. Also, in this same resurrection, Christ became a life-giving Spirit. The holy Scripture says in 1 Corinthians 15:45b, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</P><P>If you ask someone what has been accomplished by God in Christ's resurrection, he may simply say that God raised up Christ from the dead. Surely this is fundamental and according to the Scripture. But in the same Bible there are three marvelous verses which show us the intrinsic significance of Christ's resurrection. First, Acts 13:33 tells us that in resurrection God accomplished a birth. In resurrection God begot Christ to be His firstborn Son. Then 1 Peter 1:3 tells us that through resurrection God regenerated us, the millions of God-chosen people. There was such a great delivery, a great begetting, in resurrection. Third, 1 Corinthians 15:45b tells us that in resurrection the last Adam, the man Jesus, became a life-giving Spirit. These three great things took place and were accomplished in the resurrection of Christ.</P><P>The shallow teaching of Christianity tells us things mostly according to the black and white. But we have realized more by our further and deeper study. I have been studying this Book further and further for over sixty-nine years. Gradually my study of the Bible has been getting deeper and deeper and higher and higher. Today my study of the Bible concerning resurrection has become a crystallization. This crystallization is that Christ's resurrection is not merely God's raising Him from the dead. God's raising up Jesus Christ from the dead was God's act. In this one divine act, God accomplished three big things. He begot not His only Son, but His firstborn Son; He begot His many sons in this one delivery; and He made this Jesus Christ, who had just been begotten of God, the life-giving Spirit. Three great accomplishments took place in one act.</P><P>Christianity teaches people mostly to behave according to the printed pages of the Bible. There is nothing wrong with this. It is absolutely right. But they have never seen that in the raising up of Christ, in this divine act, God accomplished three big things. He produced the firstborn Son, the many sons, and the life-giving Spirit. The entire economy of God is carried out by these three items. If you were to delete Acts 13:33, 1 Peter 1:3, and 1 Corinthians 15:45b from the Bible, the firstborn Son of God, the many sons of God, and the life-giving Spirit would be absent from the divine revelation. Even though these items concerning the resurrection of Christ are in the Bible, they are mostly absent from the fundamental teaching of today's Christianity. Without these major items of the Lord's resurrection, there would be no church, no Body of Christ. If there were nothing in the Bible revealing the firstborn Son of God, the many sons of God, and the life-giving Spirit, there would be no economy of God. These items are new to many Christians, but they are not new to the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF GOD'S ECONOMY</H2><P>Since I came to the United States in 1962, I have put out many messages teaching one thing. We have gone higher and higher to reach the peak of the divine revelation, to see that the ultimate goal of God's economy is that He became a man that many of His chosen people might become God in the divine life and the divine nature, but not in the Godhead. Only God, no one else, is the unique object of our worship. We are His many sons. If the Father is God, how can you say that the many sons are not God? The New Jerusalem is a flock of God-men. God is a man. If you say that God has never been a man and is still not a man, you do not know the Bible. God has been God from eternity to eternity, without beginning or ending, but God as a man is only about two thousand years old. Jesus Christ, who was God becoming a man, was born about two thousand years ago.</P><P>God put on humanity in His incarnation. Some think that after He resurrected and ascended, He put off humanity. They think that Jesus is no longer a man. This is wrong. The Lord Jesus is still a man. He did not put off His humanity when He resurrected and ascended. In Matthew 26 the Lord Jesus was judged by the high priest who said to Him, "I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God" (v. 63). The Lord Jesus answered by saying, "You have said rightly. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven" (v. 64). The high priest asked the Lord if He was the Son of God, but He answered with "the Son of Man." The Lord has been the Son of Man in the heavens at the right hand of God since His resurrection and will be the Son of Man even at His coming back on the clouds. When Stephen was being martyred, he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God" (Acts 7:56). Stephen said this after the Lord had ascended to the heavens.</P><P>Hymns, #132, concerning the Lord's exaltation in His ascension, shows us this intrinsic revelation:</P><blockquote>Lo! in heaven Jesus sitting,<br>Christ the Lord is there enthroned;<br>As the man by God exalted,<br>With God's glory He is crowned.<br><br>He hath put on human nature,<br>Died according to God's plan,<br>Resurrected with a body,<br>And ascended as a man.<br><br>God in Him on earth was humbled,<br>God with man was domiciled;<br>Man in Him in heav'n exalted,<br>Man with God is reconciled.<br><br>He as God with man is mingled,<br>God in man is testified;<br>He as man with God is blended,<br>Man in God is glorified.<br><br>From the Glorified in heaven<br>The inclusive Spirit came;<br>All of Jesus' work and Person<br>Doth this Spirit here proclaim.<br><br>With the Glorified in heaven<br>Is the Church identified;<br>By the Spirit of this Jesus<br>Are His members edified.<br><br>Lo! a man is now in heaven<br>As the Lord of all enthroned;<br>This is Jesus Christ our Savior,<br>With God's glory ever crowned!</blockquote><P>After I came to the United States in 1962, I realized that we needed a hymnal. We selected about eight hundred hymns from other hymnals, and then we added over two hundred hymns of our own. One of these new hymns which we added is Hymns, #132.</P><P>Our God was merely God up to two thousand years ago. Then He became a man. Of course, He did not drop His divinity. He was still God. Thus, the man Jesus was a God-man. He went through human living, death, and resurrection and entered into ascension. After His ascension He is still the God-man, and through His death and resurrection, many God-men were reproduced.</P><P>The New Jerusalem is the aggregate, the totality, of many God-men. Among these many God-men, the sons of God, is the Father. Christ is the firstborn Son and we are His many "twins." The New Jerusalem is God the Father with many "God the sons." At certain times of the year, families have a reunion. Such a reunion makes the fathers of these families very happy. I believe that in the New Jerusalem, God the Father will look at "God the sons," and He will be very happy. We will be there as the many God-men. In the New Jerusalem, the Father will be the unique One, and all the others will be the sons.</P><P>I have tried my best in this message to help us understand and interpret God's holy Word in an intrinsic way so that we can see the intrinsic significances of this holy Book.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TO LIVE CHRIST FOR HIS MAGNIFICATION<br>BY THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY<br>OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:19b-21a</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>To live Christ&#151;Phil. 1:21a:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Not by our natural human life, but by the divine life of Christ in resurrection (Col. 3:4), including:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To pursue and gain Christ&#151;Phil. 3:8, 12-14.</li>		<li>To taste Christ for growing in Him&#151;1 Pet. 2:2-3.</li>		<li>To enjoy Christ as the God-allotted portion and participate in His riches in the fellowship of God&#151;Col. 1:12; 1 Cor. 1:9.</li>		<li>To abide in Christ and have Him abide in us for the growth with His life in fruit-bearing&#151;John 15:4-5.</li>		<li>To have Christ grow in us that we may be formed inwardly and even conformed to the image of Christ as the Firstborn of God among many brothers&#151;Gal. 4:19; Rom. 8:29b.</li>		<li>To grow into Christ in everything that we may mature in the measure of the stature of Christ&#151;Col. 1:28b; Eph. 4:15, 13b.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>For the magnification of Christ&#151;Phil. 1:20:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>That Christ may be seen by others in the reality of His resurrection.</li>		<li>That Christ may be ministered to others in the reality of His Spirit.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>To live Christ for His magnification is to participate in Christ's salvation in life&#151;Rom. 5:10:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To be saved from the failure of not living Christ.</li>		<li>To be saved from the defeat of not magnifying Christ.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>By the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&#151;Phil. 1:19b:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is not merely the Spirit of God as He was before the resurrection of Christ, but the Spirit of God after passing, along with Christ, through His incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, becoming the processed and consummated Spirit:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Of Jesus in His incarnation, human living, and death&#151;Acts. 16:7b.</li>		<li>And of Christ in His resurrection&#151;Rom. 8:9.</li>		<li>To be the life-giving Spirit&#151;1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>		<li>To be the Spirit, who is particularly unveiled in John 7:38-39 and who becomes the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God to be the aggregate of the consummated Triune God and marry the church, the organic Body of Christ, as the bride (Rev. 22:17).</li>		<li>To be the all-inclusive, compound Spirit compounded with Christ's divinity, His humanity, His death, the effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection, as typified by the anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-28.</li>		<li>And to be the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God's move in the degradation of the church&#151;Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The all-inclusive supply provided with whatever the processed and consummated Triune God, embodied in the all-inclusive Christ and realized in the all-inclusive Spirit, is, has, has accomplished, obtained, and attained, and will do, which is considered as the unsearchable riches of Christ to meet, in time, the need of the Christ-seekers.</li>		<li>It is by such a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ that the seekers of Christ, as His overcomers in the consummation of this age, live Him for His magnification in the New Testament economy of God for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ as the counterpart of the consummated Triune God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as His eternal enlargement and expression for eternity.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><P>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You are both the Word and the Spirit. The Word which is so solid and which is in our hand is touchable, understandable. But we need Your Spirit to give us the wisdom and revelation that we may see the intrinsic contents of Your Word and that we may understand to interpret the divine revelation according to Your desire in Your economy. Lord, this is what we need, not only now but also for our whole life in dealing with You as the Word and the Spirit. Lord, meet our need again and again from now until we see You.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INTRINSIC CONTENTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</H2><P>In my heart I have a burden to tell you the intrinsic contents of the New Testament. In order to see these intrinsic contents, we need to be unveiled again and again. Layers and layers of veils need to be taken away from us. The New Testament presents to us four acts of God and three products of these four acts. These three products issue in one ultimate goal and consummation. The four acts of God are His incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. The three products are the firstborn Son of God, the many sons of God, and the life-giving Spirit. The unique, ultimate consummation is the New Jerusalem. We need to see these four acts, three products, and one goal.</P><P>The outline of chapter one shows us the intrinsic contents of the four acts of God&#151;the incarnation, death, human living, and resurrection of Christ. The act of God in resurrection produced three great items. Before the resurrection, there was no firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33). He was produced in God's action in resurrection. Also, before the resurrection, there were no men becoming sons of God in this universe. But we were all produced as the sons of God in His act in resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). John 7:39 says that "the Spirit was not yet" before Jesus was glorified in His resurrection. First Corinthians 15:45b reveals that in resurrection, the last Adam, Christ, became a life-giving Spirit.</P><P>This life-giving Spirit is "the Spirit" in John 7:39. The life-giving Spirit, even at the Lord Jesus' time on earth, was still "not yet." Then Christ became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and this life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. Before the resurrection there was not such a God; in other words, before the resurrection the Triune God had not yet been processed and consummated. Before the resurrection of Christ, God was eternal, triune, self-existing, ever-existing, and divine, but He had only one element, the element of divinity. He did not have the elements of humanity, incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. Christ was the last Adam, the last man. The last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, and this last Adam was the embodiment of the Triune God. So the embodiment of the Triune God became the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, the life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</P><P>Before the resurrection of Christ, there was not the firstborn Son of God. Before the resurrection of Christ, there were not the many sons of God who were men regenerated to be God's sons. Before the resurrection of Christ, there was not the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. All these items of the high peak of the divine revelation are in the holy Scriptures. I am not speaking of something in the ethical or philosophical realm. I am teaching something from the intrinsic contents of the holy Word, the Word of God, which we all love.</P><P>The firstborn Son, the many sons of God, and the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God issue in one thing. That is the unique closing of the entire Bible, the New Jerusalem. It is superstitious to say that the New Jerusalem is a heavenly mansion. It is not even logical to say that the Bible tells us that our God in His economy, His oikonomia, produced a heavenly mansion as the goal of His purpose. If we could enter such a heavenly mansion, what would we do there? This is a nonsensical teaching. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated God with Himself as the firstborn Son and with the many chosen ones as His many sons. These are the intrinsic contents of the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TO LIVE CHRIST</H2><P>We need to live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19b-21a). The Spirit of Jesus Christ was not in the Old Testament, nor was He there before the resurrection of Christ. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is "the Spirit" spoken of in John 7:39. This is the Spirit after the Lord's resurrection, compounded with the Lord's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. The Spirit of God has been consummated to be the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Greek word for bountiful supply is a rich word implying provision in full. The Spirit has a rich provision to supply us in full to live Christ for His magnification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Not by Our Natural Human Life,<br>but by the Divine Life of Christ in Resurrection</H2><P>Paul said in Philippians 1:21a, "For to me, to live is Christ." Paul said this when he was in prison at Rome. In that prison he was living Christ. If someone had asked Paul what he was doing, he could have said, "I am living Christ."</P><P>Christ is our life. We, the God-men, live a human life to express God, not by our own life, our natural life, but by the divine life of Christ in resurrection (Col. 3:4). This living of Christ includes pursuing and gaining Christ (Phil. 3:8, 12-14). If we have not gained Christ, how can we live Him? If I am wearing a jacket, that means I have gained it. Without gaining it, I could not wear it. In like manner, if we have not gained Christ, we cannot live Christ.</P><P>Living Christ also includes tasting Christ for growing in Him (1 Pet. 2:2-3) and enjoying Christ as the God-allotted portion and participating in His riches in the fellowship of God (Col. 1:12; 1 Cor. 1:9). If we do not gain Him or taste Him, we cannot enjoy Him. First Corinthians 1:9 says that God has called us into the fellowship of Christ, the enjoyment of Christ.</P><P>Abiding in Christ and having Him abide in us for the growth with His life in fruit-bearing is also a part of living Christ (John 15:4-5). To live Christ by the divine life of Christ in resurrection is to have Christ grow in us that we may be formed inwardly and even conformed to the image of Christ as the Firstborn of God among many brothers (Gal. 4:19; Rom. 8:29b). Also, to live Christ includes growing into Christ in everything that we may mature in the measure of the stature of Christ (Col. 1:28b; Eph. 4:15, 13b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. For the Magnification of Christ</H2><P>We live Christ for His magnification (Phil. 1:20). If a Roman soldier had asked Paul what he was doing, Paul would have been able to say, "I am living Christ for His magnification. I am not really a prisoner. I am Christ here. I am here to show you Christ and to minister Christ to you." Christ's being magnified is so that He may be seen by others in the reality of His resurrection. In prison the apostle Paul, a human being, was Christ. He was living in the resurrection of Christ.</P><P>Christ's being magnified is also for Christ to be ministered to others in the reality of His Spirit. This happened when Paul was in prison. At the end of the book of Philippians he said, "All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household" (4:22). It should be that some of Caesar's household became believers in Christ through Paul. Through their contact with Paul, they saw Christ, so they believed and received Christ. This means that Paul ministered Christ to them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Live Christ for His Magnification<br>Being to Participate in Christ's Salvation in Life</H2><P>If Paul had wept in prison about his pitiful situation, that would have been a shame to him. No doubt, he was saved from eternal perdition by Christ, but he still needed to be saved from the shame of not living Christ. Paul's earnest expectation and hope was that he would live Christ for His magnification to participate in Christ's salvation in life (Rom. 5:10). This is to be saved from the failure of not living Christ and to be saved from the defeat of not magnifying Christ.</P><P>If others had seen Paul overwhelmed with sorrow, with anxiety, with sadness, and with despair, that would have been a shame and a defeat to him. But instead of this, the Romans saw a person in prison singing, praising, and rejoicing. This is God's dynamic salvation. This is God's victory. If others see you at your office singing and rejoicing happily day by day, they will be surprised. They will ask you why you are so happy all the time. You may tell them, "This is because I am living and magnifying Christ."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BY THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY<br>OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Spirit of Jesus Christ</H2><P>The Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19b) is not merely the Spirit of God as He was before the resurrection of Christ, but the Spirit of God after passing, along with Christ, through His incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, becoming the processed and consummated Spirit. This Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus in His incarnation, human living, and death (Acts 16:7b) and the Spirit of Christ in His resurrection (Rom. 8:9). He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) and the Spirit, who is particularly unveiled in John 7:38-39 and who becomes the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God to be the aggregate of the consummated Triune God and marry the church, the organic Body of Christ, as the bride. So at the end, the closing, of the Bible, Revelation 22:17 says, "The Spirit and the bride...." The Spirit is the consummated Triune God, and the bride is the transformed tripartite man. They form a couple in eternity.</P><P>The Spirit is also the all-inclusive, compound Spirit compounded with Christ's divinity, His humanity, His death, the effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection, as typified by the anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-28. Such a Spirit is eventually the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God's move in the degradation of the church (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Bountiful Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</H2><P>The all-inclusive supply, provided with whatever the processed and consummated Triune God, embodied in the all-inclusive Christ and realized in the all-inclusive Spirit, is, has, has accomplished, obtained, attained, and will do, is considered as the unsearchable riches of Christ to meet, in time, the need of the Christ-seekers. When we mean business to seek after Christ, we will receive this bountiful supply. It is by such a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ that the seekers of Christ, as His overcomers in the consummation of this age, live Him for His magnification in the New Testament economy of God for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ as the counterpart of the consummated Triune God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as His eternal enlargement and expression for eternity.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TO BE CONFORMED<br>TO THE IMAGE OF GOD'S SON<br>THAT HE MIGHT BE THE FIRSTBORN AMONG MANY BROTHERS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:29</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The image of God's Son:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The image of the Lord Jesus Christ&#151;Rom. 1:3-4:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The Lord Jesus Christ being God and man.</li>		<li>His image is the image of One who is both God and man.</li>		<li>Having lived a life of man for the expression of God:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>A man whose living is not by his human life but by God's divine life.</li>			<li>God's divine attributes becoming his human virtues.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>Such an image being the image of the first God-man in the universe, who is Christ.</li>	</ol></li><li>The predestination of God:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The believers in Christ, who have been called and justified by God, being predestinated to be conformed to the image of the first God-man, Jesus Christ&#151;Rom. 8:29-30.</li>	<li>They becoming the many God-men as the many brothers (the mass reproduction) of the first God-man (the prototype).</li>	<li>Thus, Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18) becoming the firstborn Son of God&#151;Rom. 8:29-30:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Christ, as the Son of God, putting humanity upon Himself in His incarnation.</li>		<li>Although He being the Son of God possessing divinity, His human part not being divine, not being the Son of God.</li>		<li>Christ's human part, as the seed of David, being designated, uplifted into His divinity by the Spirit of holiness (the essence of His divinity) in resurrection to become a part of His divine sonship.</li>		<li>Thus, as the only begotten Son of God without humanity, Christ becoming the firstborn Son of God with both divinity and humanity.</li>		<li>All the God-men, the believers in Christ, needing to be conformed to the image of such a firstborn Son of God, living a life crucified in the human life to live by the divine life that they may be the real God-men to be the expression of God in humanity with the divine attributes lived out from humanity, to be the reality of the church as the organic Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem, as revealed in details from the following chapters of Romans to the end of Revelation, for the carrying out of the eternal economy of God.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><P>Now we must see that we need to be conformed to the image of God's Son that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). We can illustrate what this means by considering a group of eight brothers. The first brother is a very big, husky, strong American, but the other seven are weak and sickly. If this big, husky American man would say that the other seven are his brothers, no one would believe him. On the other hand, if all of his brothers were the same as he is, everyone would say that they are his "twins," because they all look the same.</P><P>The situation among today's Christians is a sad story. Today, in a sense, Satan can "clap his hands," and say to the Lord, "You are the Firstborn among many brothers, but look at Your millions of believers. Who is the same as You?" This is why Romans 8:29 says that God predestinated those whom He has justified to be conformed to the image of His Son. This is like saying that all of the weak and sickly brothers have to be conformed to the image of their husky brother. When we are conformed to the image of Christ, then He can be the Firstborn among His many brothers. What a shame it is to Christ that His brothers, His "twins," are so poor and do not match Him!</P><P>In the new man Christ is all and in all. There is no room for any natural person. In the new man there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free man. All are Christ. Christ is all the members and in all the members (Col. 3:10-11). He is everything in the new man. Actually, He is the new man, His Body (1 Cor. 12:12). There is no such thing as a Japanese church, a Chinese church, a Puerto Rican church, or a Taiwanese church. In the new man there is room only for Christ. We all should be conformed to the image of Christ, the Son of God, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers. If we would not be conformed to the first God-man, the prototype, then this God-man would not have "twins." Then He could not be the Firstborn. This is what Paul means in Romans 8:29.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE IMAGE OF GOD'S SON</H2><P>The image of God's Son is the image of the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 1:3-4). The Lord Jesus Christ is God and man. Thus, His image is the image of One who is both God and man. He lived a life of man for the expression of God. He was a man whose living was not by His human life but by God's divine life. Thus, God's divine attributes became His human virtues. The image of God's Son is the image of the first God-man in the universe, who is Christ. All of His believers as His many "twins" should be conformed to His image.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE PREDESTINATION OF GOD</H2><P>The believers in Christ, who have been called and justified by God, were predestinated to be conformed to the image of the first God-man, Jesus Christ (Rom. 8:29-30). They become the many God-men as the many brothers (the mass reproduction) of the first God-man (the prototype).</P><P>Thus, Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18) becomes the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29-30). Without us, He cannot be the Firstborn. For someone to be the firstborn, he needs "twins." If he is the only son, he is not the firstborn. He is the only begotten. For Christ, the first God-man, to be the firstborn Son of God, He needs us, the "twins," to be conformed to His image.</P><P>Christ, as the Son of God, put humanity upon Himself in His incarnation. Although He was the Son of God possessing divinity, His human part was not divine, that is, it was not the Son of God. Christ's human part, as the seed of David, was designated, uplifted into His divinity by the Spirit of holiness (the essence of His divinity) in Christ to become a part of His divine sonship. Thus, as the only begotten Son of God without humanity, Christ became the firstborn Son of God with both divinity and humanity. All the God-men, the believers in Christ, need to be conformed to the image of such a firstborn Son of God, living a life crucified in the human life to live by the divine life that they may be the real God-men to be the expression of God in humanity with the divine attributes lived out from humanity, to be the reality of the church as the organic Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem, as revealed in details from the following chapters of Romans (chapters 9&#151;16) to the end of Revelation, for the carrying out of the eternal economy of God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TO BUILD UP THE BODY OF CHRIST<br>BY GROWING INTO HIM,<br>THE HEAD, IN ALL THINGS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:15-16</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Body of Christ is:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The center, reality, and goal of the eternal economy of God, consummating in the New Jerusalem&#151;Rev. 21:1&#151;22:5.</li>	<li>The church:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The congregation of God's called-out ones.</li>		<li>Appearing in many cities to be the local churches as the many local expressions of the one church on the earth, without any division of nationalities, races, and social ranks&#151;Acts 8:1;

THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>In this chapter we want to see that we need to grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things to build up the Body of Christ. To build up the Body of Christ, we first have to know what the Body of Christ is. Today it is difficult to see the reality of the building up of the Body of Christ. Today even the term the Body of Christ is very rarely used, and when it is used, it is not used properly.</P><P>I would like to say an intimate word in fellowship, especially to the co-workers and elders among us. Do not forget that whatever you do in your locality or universally for other countries should be done in a full realization that you are building up the Body of Christ. You may have a real burden to take care of the church in your locality, yet you should always realize that you are not doing a work just for the building up of the work. When you are working to take care of the church, always keep a view of the Body. You should say, "Lord, what I am doing here is not for this, but for Your Body. I am under Your sovereign assignment, or arrangement, to work in this locality. It seems that I am doing a work to build up the local church here. But, Lord, actually I am not doing things to just build up the local church here in my locality. What I am doing, Lord, is altogether for the building up of Your Body."</P><P>Now I would like to present to you nine points of what the Body of Christ is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Center, Reality, and Goal<br>of the Eternal Economy of God,<br>Consummating in the New Jerusalem</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the center, the reality, and the ultimate goal of God's eternal economy, consummating in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:1&#151;22:5). Dear co-workers and dear elders, do you have the assurance that what you are doing in your locality is building up the center and reality of the economy of God and is building up something that can attain to the final goal of God's eternal economy? For years I have realized that even among us, some have considered that the place where they work is a district of their work. There was such a fact among us about ten years ago. A co-worker checked with some brothers, saying that when they came to his district to work, they should have notified him. This illustration is a real fact. If you have such a feeling, you are off. You are not building up the center, the reality, and the goal of God's economy. You are building up your little empire. In 1948, after Brother Nee had been working among us for twenty-six years, he was forced to give a message in Shanghai, in which he told a number of the workers that they were building up their little monarchy, or empire. Then he said that the churches which they built up were their own "native monarchies." You must have the assurance that, wherever you are and whatever you do, you are building up the center, the reality, and the goal of the eternal economy of God, which will attain the New Jerusalem. If you do not have such assurance, it is better to stop; it is better not to do anything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Church</H2><P>The Body of Christ is first the church, the congregation, the gathering, the assembly, of the called-out ones. This is the meaning of the Greek word ekklesia. The church appears in many cities to be the local churches as the many local expressions of the one church on the earth, without any division of nationalities, races, and social ranks (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11). When I came to the United States and saw that there were so-called white churches and black churches, I was shocked. When I was a young man, I wondered how the Church of England could be in my hometown in mainland China. On the other hand, in the Chinese community in Southern California there is a Taiwanese church. What a shame it is for Christians to be divided in such ways! The Body of Christ has no nationality, no race, and no social rank.</P><P>Although the local churches are the many local expressions, they still remain "the [one] church" (Eph. 1:22-23), "the [unique] church of God" (1 Cor. 10:32; Acts 20:28) universally in its unique unity, unique oneness. Paul said that we should not become a stumbling block to the Jews, the Greeks, or the church of God. The church of God means all the churches on earth. Do not think that you can build a church that is separated from the other churches. If you have this kind of thought, you are off. The church's unity, oneness, is universal. The church is not divided and should not be divisive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Organism of the Processed<br>and Consummated Triune God</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God constituted with the believers in Christ, the many God-men, as the outward human framework; the life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, as the divine essence; the all-inclusive Christ, the unlimited Christ, as the divine element; and God the Father, who is over all and through all and in all, as the divine source (Eph. 4:4-6). In other words, this organism of God is constituted with the believing human beings as the outward framework and the Triune God&#151;the Spirit, the Son, and the Father. The Spirit is the essence, the Son is the element, and the Father is the source. The essence is within the element.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Wife of the Processed<br>and Consummated Christ</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the wife of the processed and consummated Christ. She is Christ's counterpart, typified by Eve as the counterpart to Adam (Gen. 2:21b-24; Eph. 5:29-33; Rev. 21:2, 9; 22:17a). Eve was produced out of Adam, typifying that the church is produced out of Christ through His death and resurrection. When Adam was sleeping, God opened up his side, took out a rib, and built that rib into a woman. When Adam awoke, his wife Eve was presented to him. This signifies death and resurrection. Eve came out of Adam and was joined back to Adam to be one flesh with Adam. This shows that the church was produced out of Christ through His death and resurrection and joined back to Christ to be one entity with Him in life and in nature.</P><P>Christ is God Himself. The processed and consummated God, not the original God, has a wife. In eternity God was merely divine; He had not yet been processed and consummated. He did not yet have a wife. But when the very eternal God was processed and consummated through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, something came out of His pierced side (John 19:34). The Lord's pierced side was prefigured by Adam's opened side, out from which Eve was produced. Christ's death released the divine life from within Him, and His resurrection life produces the wife of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The New Man</H2><P>The Body of Christ is also the new man (Col. 3:10-11; Eph. 2:15; 4:24). How could the church be both a wife and a man? This is not according to our human logic, but in the biblical logic, Christ's wife is the new man.</P><P>The new man is the corporate God-man. The first God-man, the firstborn Son of God, is the Head of this corporate God-man&#151;the new man. The many God-men, the many sons of God, are the Body of this corporate God-man&#151;the new man.</P><P>Both the Head and the Body of this new man are in resurrection: The first God-man, Christ, became the Head of the corporate new man in resurrection, in which He became the Firstborn from the dead (Col. 1:18). The many God-men, the believers in Christ, became the Body of the corporate new man in resurrection, in which they, the natural men in race, in religion, in culture, and in social rank, became the regenerated sons of God (1 Pet. 1:3a).</P><P>In the natural life we belong to different races, such as Chinese, American, and Japanese. But all the believing Chinese, Americans, and Japanese were regenerated to be something new, and this is the new man. In the new man there is no more race. Christ is not only the Head but also every member of this new man. Colossians 3:10 and 11 say that in the new man Christ is all and in all. In other words, Christ is everyone and is in everyone. He is not only the Head but also all the members of the new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The New Creation of God</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the new creation of God (Gal. 6:15). This new creation is the believers in Christ, the corporate new man, the aggregate of the many God-men. They all are in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17). In the old creation, they were in Adam. But they have been transferred from Adam into Christ by regeneration. They are also in the resurrection of Christ. The new creation of God was produced out of the old creation of God in the resurrection of Christ through the death of Christ (Eph. 2:15). Ephesians 2:15 reveals that Christ on His cross put the old creation to an end and created in Himself in resurrection a new creation. The processed and consummated Triune God consummated a new creation, out of His old creation, with Himself as the creating element. We must keep in mind the difference between the old creation and the new creation. The old creation has no element of God in it. But the new creation is full of the element of God. God has constituted Himself as the element into the new creation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Household of God</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the household of God (Eph. 2:19b). This is the household of the faith&#151;the universal family of God (Gal. 6:10), composed of God as the Father and the believers in Christ, the many sons of God. God the Father has a great family of many sons. The Father is God and the sons are "small gods" in life and nature but not in the Godhead. If a father is a man, are not his sons men? Since the father is a man, the sons all must be men. In the divine family, the Father is God, so all the sons are gods, the many God-men, in life and nature but not in the Godhead. First Timothy 3:15-16 reveals that the church is the manifestation of God in the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Mingling of Divinity with Humanity</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the mingling of divinity with humanity. The processed and consummated Triune God is mingled with the regenerated and transformed tripartite men. God abides in man and man abides in God, coinhering and living as one person (John 15:4-5). This is a mingling. Some in the early history of the church heretically taught that the mingling of God and man produced a third nature. But in the mingling of God and man, the two entities become one, with their own respective natures remaining distinct and without a third nature being produced. This is the truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. The Masterpiece of God</H2><P>Paul said in Ephesians 2:10 that we are the masterpiece of God. The Greek word for masterpiece is poiema, a poem. The Body of Christ as the new creation, as the organism of God, is the poem of God. This masterpiece of God was created in Christ through His death and resurrection with His divine element in its all-inclusiveness. This is why this masterpiece is a poem. As God's masterpiece we should walk in the things prepared by God for the accomplishment of His eternal economy.</P><P>We need a vision of the above nine items of the Body of Christ. This is what we are working on and building up. When we see this vision, our seeing will revolutionize us. It will change us, change our concept, change our attitude, and change our realization of God's work.</P><P>The tenth item of the Body of Christ is in Ephesians 6, which reveals that the church is the warrior, fighting against God's enemy, Satan, for the establishment of God's kingdom (vv. 10-20). The nine items listed above speak of the nature, the element, and essence of what the Body of Christ should be. The church as the warrior is not in this category, so I purposely did not include it in the outline.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TO BUILD UP SUCH A BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>Our work must be a work that builds up such a Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12, 16). This will change our idea. This will change our view. If you have such a view, you cannot carry out any piece of work that is not a part of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Growing in Life</H2><P>We build up the Body of Christ by growing in life (Eph. 4:15). How much a co-worker can build up the church depends upon how much he grows in Christ. Actually our work to build up the Body of Christ is not a kind of work. It has to be a growth in the life of Christ. In other words, our building-up work should be the increase of the measure of Christ in us. We must grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things. Today in many things, we are not in Christ but outside of Him. We need to grow up into Christ in everything, small or great.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Living of a Life<br>Conformed to the Death of Christ</H2><P>This growing is the living of a life conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection and by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 3:10; 1:19b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. A Corporate Building</H2><P>Such a growing affords a corporate building to the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:16). When we all grow together in everything into Christ, this is a corporate growing, so it affords a corporate building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>Then all the members of the Body of Christ are joined together through every joint of the rich supply. The joints are the gifted members&#151;the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers (v. 11). Without their joining the members together, there can be no building. Let us consider the illustration of a big building. This building is strongly joined together by steel beams, which are a steel frame. In the Body of Christ we are joined together through every joint of the rich supply.</P><P>The Body is also knit together through the operation in the measure of each one part. Once the frame of a building is in place, there is the need of an interweaving, a compacting together, of material to fill in the gaps. The material is knit together by being compacted together in a solid way. In the Body of Christ, to be knit together is to be built together through the operation in the measure of each one part. This includes every member of the Body of Christ. Each one part refers to each member of the Body. Through the growth in life and the development of gifts, each member of the Body of Christ has its own measure, which operates for the growth of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INTRINSIC VIEW OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE</H2><P>I would now like to intimately share what is on my heart. I want to fellowship concerning what the entire Bible shows us. The Bible has sixty-six books with many chapters, but what does such a book show us? I want to present a very intrinsic view of what the Bible tells us.</P><P>In an intrinsic way, the Bible unveils to us that the eternal God, who is divine, triune, holy, self-existing, and ever- existing, had a good pleasure (Eph. 1:5, 9). One day according to the good pleasure of His desire, He came out of eternity and into time. That was only about two thousand years ago. He came into time to become a man and to live as a man on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. He passed through such a human living. Eventually, for the need, He entered into a death, which I would call the all-problem-solving death, the all-inclusive death which solves all problems. He entered into that death, He traveled through that death, and He had a good "sightseeing" in that death.</P><P>On the third day, He came out of that death and entered into resurrection, the all-conquering resurrection. In this resurrection, His human part was born into divinity to produce the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33). At the same time, in that big birth, He regenerated all His chosen, fallen, redeemed, and justified people to be the many sons of God (1 Pet. 1:3). So, in this resurrection the firstborn Son and the many sons of God were produced. Also, in resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), who is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</P><P>Then He ascended far above all the heavens. This was an all-transcending ascension. In this transcending ascension, He was made the Head of the Body, the church, even the Head of all things, having the first place in all things (Col. 1:18). He was also made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36) and the Leader of all the kings and the Savior (5:31) to be our High Priest in the New Testament economy (Heb. 4:14; 7:26; 9:11), the Mediator of a new covenant (9:15), the surety of a better covenant (7:22), the Minister in the heavenly Holy of Holies (8:2), the Paraclete (Advocate) of the New Testament believers (1 John 2:1; John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7), and the New Testament believers' Intercessor at the right hand of God and within them as well (Rom. 8:34, 26).</P><P>In the first step of the process He went through, the first God-man was produced. At the conclusion of His process in resurrection, the firstborn Son of God was produced, the many sons of God were regenerated, and He Himself became the life-giving Spirit. He did all of this within thirty-three and a half years on earth. He is the embodiment of the Triune God (the Father, the Son, and the Spirit) who became the first God-man and then the firstborn Son of God and the life-giving Spirit. As such a One, He transcended to a place above all the heavens. He transcended above four layers: Hades, the earth, the air, and the third heaven (Eph. 1:20-21; 4:8-10; Heb. 4:14; 7:26). He ascended there with all the many sons (Eph. 2:6).</P><P>From the day of His ascension, He began as the consummated Spirit, as the consummation of the processed consummated Triune God, to sanctify the many sons regenerated by Him (Heb. 2:10-11). They were regenerated, but not grown up yet. So He still works as the all-inclusive consummated Spirit to sanctify them, making them holy unto God. He also renews them from the old creation into the new (Titus 3:5), transforms them to change their constitution from the constitution of the old creation to the constitution of the new creation to have a constitution of the redeemed and regenerated human beings with the divine element (2 Cor. 3:18). Following transformation, He conforms them to the image of the firstborn Son of God to make them the real God-men, the real sons of God, and the real brothers of the first God-man, the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). Eventually, He will bring all of them into glory, to glorify them in the glory of the processed and consummated Triune God (Phil. 3:21). This will consummate in the New Jerusalem, which will be the mingling of divinity with humanity to be the very expansion, enlargement, increase, and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in humanity forever. This is all that the Bible tells us. We all need to see this. This will become a very controlling vision, directing our life, our move, and our action on this earth so that we can be a real son of God, a real brother of Christ, and a real God-man that we may overcome as He has overcome (John 16:33; Rev. 3:21) to bring in the kingdom age.</P></body></html>
