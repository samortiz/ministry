Now let us consider our positive union with the Lord.</p><p>In verse 2 the word "mind" in Greek is nous. The word "bodies" in verse 1 is soma in Greek. When the outward body is presented as a sacrifice, there is one positive result: the renewing and transformation of the mind. Verse 2 points out a matter on the negative side: "Do not be fashioned according to this age." In the Bible the world refers to the world organization and the world spirit. It does not necessarily refer to the outward things of the world. A Christian can shun all the things in the world, but the spirit of the world can still be in him. The Israelites left Egypt in their bodies, but their minds were still craving Egypt. Who can give up the love of the world? Only those who are consecrated and whose minds have been renewed and transformed can give up the love of the world. Many Christians act and live the same way as the people in the world. Their minds and thoughts are the same as the people in the world. We often say that a person is very political or that he is very smart or business-minded. When God delivers us, He delivers us out of all kinds of worldly minds. A perplexing thing among God's children is that their guidance concerning God's will is often based on their mind. They discern God's will according to their political and business-like mind. But when the cross touches our whole being, it touches our mind as well. Only those whose minds are renewed can have a transformed mind.</p><p>In Romans 12:1-2 there are things that we should do and things that we should not do. We should not be fashioned according to this age. This means that we should not walk according to the manner of this world; instead, we should be renewed and transformed. Renewal is on our side, and transformation is on God's side. This means being changed from the world image and our self image to the image of the Lord. This is transformation. Not only does our mind have to be renewed in regard to sinful things, but in regard to our total walk and spiritual life as well. In this renewal we experience resurrection. Originally, the sacrifices are dead. But when Christ lives in us, we have the mind, the thoughts, and the understanding of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD'S WILL</h2><p>Not everyone can know God's will. Only those whose bodies are presented as living sacrifices and whose minds are renewed and transformed can know His will. Then the knowledge of His will comes effortlessly and spontaneously.</p><p>God's will is the manifestation of His life. His life is clean and pure; it enables men to discern the flesh and the natural man and delivering men from carnality and worldliness. Only those who are delivered from these things can know God's will and prove what the will of the Lord is. When we present our bodies and are renewed and transformed in our mind, we can know God's will. There is no easier or lighter way than the cross.</p><p>The easiest and quickest way to know God's will is through the cross. Only the stripping and smiting of the cross will expose the natural life, the flesh, the lusts, the world, and the human mind. Only through the stripping will we know the power of the cross. It is useless to lecture, teach, or exhort others. They may be very eager to learn. But if they have not consecrated themselves, they will not receive any help at all. However, when the cross operates in them, their mind will be renewed and transformed. The natural life must be dealt with before one can see any result in the spiritual life.</p><p>It is easy to criticize, but it is hard to have a vision of the spiritual things. It is easy to slander, but it is hard to discern and to judge. There is a difference between proper discernment and criticism. Those who are in the light will discern without criticism or slander.</p><p>What do we know about God's will? Romans 12:2 says that God's will is good. Because something is good does not necessarily make it God's will, but all that is of God's will is good. If a believer's mind is renewed before God, this mind surely will be good. Many people can talk about God's will with their mouth, but only those who know the cross can say that God's will is good. God's will is also perfect. This means that it is flawless and irreproachable. God's will is also well pleasing. When we present our bodies as a living sacrifice, we are doing something well pleasing to God, and God's will also becomes well pleasing to us. At this point all murmurings cease, and there are no complaints against heaven or against man. God's will is not in man's mind, wavering and fluctuating like the waves. It is something that is manifested before men. Only those who rest in the Lord can know God's will. If a man is in a state of turmoil, confusion, grievance, and unrest, it means that he does not have the mark of the cross. Such a one cannot know God's will. If we criticize, complain, or are dissatisfied with God's will, it means that we have never consecrated ourselves to the Lord. If a man thinks that his means are better and his ways are higher, it shows that he is void of light and has not seen the cross.</p><p>In order to know God's will, we have to present our bodies as a living sacrifice. We should not be fashioned according to this age, and our minds must be renewed and transformed. These three things are the conditions for knowing God's will. God's will is a great thing. When we have these three facts with us, we will have no problem in knowing God's will. Otherwise, we will never know it in a genuine way.</p><p>Prayer: Lord! May these words not be words that just come out of our mouth. May they be the cries from our heart. Be merciful to us. We do not want to be dealt with in a fragmentary way. Deal with us once and for all in a fundamental way. May we not murmur, and may our only fear be of not knowing Your will. We look to You for Your mercy and shining so that we can know God's will thoroughly and clearly. In Your name we pray, amen.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 45: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (5) &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
