   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TYPIFYING CHRIST A. As the Embodiment of God s Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ark, the incense altar, the showbread table, and the lampstand are all types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ has many aspects, and these four items show forth different aspects of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a type of Christ, the ark typifies Christ as the embodiment of God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ark as the embodiment of God s testimony typifies Christ as the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All that God is, is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Colossians 2:9 says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our use of the word embodiment is based on this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because God is embodied in Christ, He is portrayed, defined, and explained by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is God s definition, His explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As God s testimony, Christ is typified by the ark of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Colossians 2:9 we have a clear statement saying that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With the ark of the testimony we have a picture, a type, which corresponds to this direct statement.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In teaching children to read, a teacher often shows a picture of an object with the word identifying it underneath.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, there may be a picture of an airplane, and underneath the picture the word airplane.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Bible we have both pictures and words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning Christ as the embodiment of God s testimony, we have the word in Colossians 2:9 and the picture of the ark in the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. For God s Redeemed People</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>to Contact Him and Enjoy Him</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Apart from Christ we cannot meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only is God in Christ, but Christ Himself actually is God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John 1:1 says that the Word, which is Christ, was with God and was God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Romans 9:5 Paul says that Christ is God blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jesus, a carpenter from Nazareth, was the very God over all and blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The only way for us to contact God and enjoy Him is through Christ and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ark as a type of Christ indicates that God s redeemed people can contact God and enjoy God in Christ and through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because the Jews do not contact God in Christ, they do not have genuine contact with God, and they certainly do not enjoy God, even though they may worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is doubtful that today s Jews even have the concept of enjoying God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, they emphasize fearing God, worshipping God, exalting God, and adoring God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They may wonder how we can speak of contacting God and enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the New Testament reveals that God has come in Christ that we may contact Him, receive Him, and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the ark of the testimony, Christ is for us to contact God and enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE CENTER OF THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>OF TESTIMONY A. Signifying the Center</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>of God s Dwelling Place</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we look at a diagram of the tabernacle, we may wonder how it is possible to say that the ark of the testimony is the center of the tabernacle of testimony 38:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But in the Bible it is the inmost part of something which is regarded as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, although our heart is not located at the exact center of our body, we nonetheless regard it as being in the center.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, because the Holy of Holies is in the inmost part of the tabernacle, it is the center of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is the focus of the tabernacle and signifies the center of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God dwelt in the tabernacle, but not in the outer court or in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He dwelt in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The ark in the Holy of Holies signifies the center of God s dwelling place, the church Eph 2:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The cover of the ark is equal to the throne of grace in Hebrews 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was upon the cover of the ark, the throne of grace, that God dwelt.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was the exact place where God was.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Old Testament this place was in the tabernacle of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But in the New Testament this place is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church today is God s tabernacle, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>B. Signifying the Contents of the House of God</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The ark also signifies the contents of the church as the house of God 1 Tim 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Just as the ark as the embodiment of God s testimony was the content of the tabernacle, so Christ as the embodiment of God is the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many Christians argue over who is the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some may ask, Why do you say that you are the church?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Are we not the church also?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When this question is raised, our inward feeling may be, You claim to be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But what is your content?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do you have Christ as the embodiment of God s testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Inwardly the church must have Christ as the content in reality and not merely in terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Outwardly the church must be on the proper ground, the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This ground is also the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Any ground other than the ground of locality is not the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church in Jerusalem was built on the ground of the locality of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, it was established on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Among Christians today there are so-called churches built on many different grounds, such as the ground of presbytery, immersion, or certain teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All these grounds are divisive, the basis for division.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They are not the unique and genuine ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we would be the church, we must comply with both the outward prerequisite and the inward prerequisite.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The outward prerequisite is the ground of oneness, and the inward prerequisite is Christ as the contents, as the embodiment of God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we claim to be the church, we must have Christ not merely in terminology, but in reality as the embodiment of God s living testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Certain groups of Christians are actually societies, not churches, because their content is something other than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The church is the Body of Christ with Christ as life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The content of the church is Christ as the embodiment of God s testimony.</S>
