<h2 class="head1">THE FRUIT BORNE BY THE BRANCHES</h2>
<p>Some teach that the fruit borne by the branches is ethical virtues such as love, longsuffering, kindness, etc., as mentioned in Galatians 5:22-23. But the fruit in John 15 is not our good conduct, or behavior. The fruit borne by the branches does not denote moral virtues as in Galatians 5:22-23, but denotes the saved persons regenerated with the divine life through the dispensing of the branches (John 15:16b). This is proved by the requirement that the bearer of this kind of fruit should &ldquo;go forth.&rdquo; To bear ethical and moral virtues as fruit does not require us to go forth. We do not need to go forth to bear the fruit of love, longsuffering, kindness, etc. But to bear fruit as persons regenerated through our dispensing of the divine life requires us to go forth. We need to go forth to contact and reach the people who will become our fruit.</p>
<p>The fact that this kind of fruit should &ldquo;remain&rdquo; also proves that the fruit in John 15 denotes saved persons. If the fruit that we bear are virtues, there would be no need to mention that these virtues should remain. But the Lord Jesus clearly says that we should go forth to bear fruit and that our fruit should remain. This proves that the fruit here is not moral virtues but persons. In the past we may have borne some fruit, but they did not remain. Immediately after a new child is delivered, he needs to be properly taken care of. Otherwise, he will not remain. Thus, immediately after we baptize people, we need to set up a home meeting with them; this meeting will be the very channel, instrument, or means for us to keep these new ones as remaining fruit. Now we have a way to keep our fruit. The home meeting is a way to keep them, to hold them, that they could remain. This requires much labor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PATHWAY FOR FRUIT-BEARING</h2>
<p>The pathway for fruit-bearing is to abide in the vine (John 15:5), that is, to remain in the very organic union with Christ, receiving the Father&rsquo;s pruning (v. 2b). We have to remain in this union as persons always living Him. We have seen that the Father&rsquo;s pruning implies His exposing through His divine shining. When we confess our defects, shortcomings, and wrongdoings to Him in His light, we are cooperating with Him to get this pruning completed, finished, accomplished.</p>
<p>This pathway also includes having the words of the Lord abiding within us (John 15:7). &ldquo;Words&rdquo; in verse 7 in Greek is <em>rhema</em> which refers to the Lord&rsquo;s instant words, not the constant word. When we are in the divine fellowship, enjoying the divine exposing, and we cooperate with this divine exposing by our confessing, we are receiving the very Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God and as the instant word. When we are in this kind of fellowship, we have the sensation of a speaking, an oracle, going on within us. When we are cut off from the enjoyment of Christ, we do not have this speaking in us. We are empty within. But when we are in the divine fellowship under the divine shining and are confessing to cooperate with this shining, something in us begins to speak all the time. In big things, in small things, and in everything, there is a speaking in us. That speaking is the divine <em>rhema,</em> which is Christ Himself. If we have the speaking word, we have Christ.</p>
<p>When we take two verses in the morning to have a good time with the Lord and enter into the enjoyment of Him through the Word, the whole day we will have Someone speaking in us. This Someone is Christ as the instant word, and this instant word, this oracle, is the very presence of the Triune God. The Triune God is a Person, and He is not only the spoken word but also the speaking word in us. This speaking One bothers us when we go against Him. We may like to go somewhere, but within us there is a &ldquo;no.&rdquo; This speaking, this word, is the living One, the presence of the Triune God, warning us not to go. We have to renew this speaking in us every day by picking up two verses early in the morning to enjoy the Lord. We must have the divine speaking in us all day and every day in our Christian life. This speaking is the oracle; this oracle is the word; this word is Christ; this Christ is the Triune God; and this Triune God is the very presence of the divine Person.</p>
<p>The pathway to fruit-bearing also includes praying for fruit-bearing (John 15:7b). If we practice the principles in this chapter, we will be very fruitful. We will bear cluster after cluster of &ldquo;grapes.&rdquo; We need to aspire to be a part of the building up of such a practice in our local church. We need to reconsecrate ourselves to the Lord in a thorough way, presenting ourselves to Him as His branches to build up the practice of fruit-bearing in the local churches.</p>
<p>In the universe, the Son of the Trinity is the organism of the Triune God, and this organism is the expression of the Triune God. The way for this organism to express the Triune God is through its many branches. We are the branches of the organism of the Triune God. The function and the purpose of the branches is to bear fruit. Fruit-bearing is the multiplication of the divine organism. The multiplication is the glorification of the source of the divine Trinity, the Father, and this glorification is the very expression of the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Life and fruit-bearing both need to be emphasized. Some stress life to the uttermost, but life without fruit-bearing is empty. Life operates, lives, moves, acts, and works to produce fruit. Life is for the reproduction, for the multiplication, for the glorification, for the expression of the source of life, the Father. This is why there is the need of fruit-bearing. Others stress work and activity such as going to the mission field with not much life. Thus, what is done is mostly activity alone and not fruit-bearing. We need both life and fruit-bearing.</p>
