ACCORDING TO THE GOSPEL REVEALED IN ROMANS</h2>
<p>The Reformation began in the late fifteenth century. Martin Luther recovered the truth of justification by faith and unlocked the Bible. Hence, the Bible became an open book. After the Reformation some who cherished the truth discovered many truths in the Bible and were willing to practice what they saw. Hence, many groups established independent gatherings. These gatherings were the beginning of today&rsquo;s denominations. For example, some saw that baptism in the Bible was by immersion in water, not by sprinkling. According to this light, they practiced baptism by immersion in water. This resulted in the Baptist Church. Others saw the truth of church governance by a body of elders, so they preached this truth, which resulted in the Presbyterian Church. The Wesleyan Church, or the Methodist Church, resulted from the teachings of John Wesley. The term <em>Methodist</em> comes from the word <em>method</em> and refers to following methods and rules. The believers who formed the Methodist Church had a high regard for discipline, and they lived strictly by the rules of a holy life. However, they lacked genuine knowledge and vision related to Christ and the church.</p>
<p>The Reformation did not revive the church. It was not until the early nineteenth century that the Lord raised up the Brethren in England, who further unlocked the truth in the Bible and recovered the church life. Initially, the Brethren paid much attention to Christ. But later they were distracted and turned their attention to doctrines and different practices, which brought in divisions. As a result, in less than five decades they became dry and dead. Although the Brethren practiced the church life, they were too much on the line of knowledge. It was common for believers to pay no attention to the Holy Spirit. Some believers, however, reacted to this condition, and as a result the Pentecostal movement began. The Pentecostal movement emphasizes speaking in tongues, interpreting tongues, prophesying to foretell, healing, and casting out demons. This movement was a reaction to the dead doctrines of the Brethren. However, even though the believers in the Pentecostal movement are not dead, they do not teach the truth, nor do they have much Christ.</p>
<p>There were people in church history who had a deep knowledge and experience of the inner life. These people are called the inner-life group. The inner-life movement began in the seventeenth century with Catholic mystics, such as Father Fenelon and Madame Guyon. These believers were strong in the matter of the inner life and emphasized denying the self and bearing the cross. However, they lacked the knowledge of Christ being the Spirit to be man&rsquo;s life and to make man His Body, which is expressed in localities.</p>
<p>William Law was raised up in the eighteenth century. He improved upon the writings of the mystics and helped many people. Later, Andrew Murray developed William Law&rsquo;s writings. Andrew Murray is an important figure because he recovered the truth concerning Christ as the inner life and experience of the believers. His masterpiece is the book <em>The Spirit of Christ.</em> He knew Christ as the Spirit, Christ as life, and Christ in resurrection. However, he lacked knowledge of the Body of Christ and did not see the local expression of the Body of Christ. Hence, his revelation did not go past Romans 8.</p>
<p>The last renowned teacher of the inner life, Brother T. Austin-Sparks, knew the resurrection of Christ and the Body of Christ in principle. However, he did not see how the Body of Christ could be expressed practically in a locality. Furthermore, he opposed and condemned the practice of the local church. Therefore, the revelation that he received went only as far as Romans 12.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE LOCAL CHURCH<br />
AS A GOLDEN LAMPSTAND MANIFESTED IN A LOCALITY</h2>
<p>Eventually, the Lord could go no further in the West and was forced to come to China, a pagan and Gentile land. The people of China did not know Christ; thus, it was virgin soil that had not been touched by the confusion of Christianity. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in China for sixty years. During this time the Lord has gradually revealed to us that the first section of Romans is concerning justification, the second section of Romans is concerning sanctification, the third section of Romans is concerning the Body of Christ, and the fourth section of Romans is concerning the local churches. The spiritual publications that we have published over the past sixty years can also be categorized into the four sections of justification, sanctification, the Body of Christ, and the local churches. However, we must not be proud and think that we have arrived at the final station. In some respects we have not yet arrived at the final station. Even if we have arrived, we must be careful, because if we do not stand firm, we will fall from the overcoming condition of the church in Philadelphia to the degraded condition of the church in Laodicea (Rev. 3:7-22). Therefore, the local churches must examine their spiritual condition in order to know whether they have arrived at the final station and in order to be careful and watchful lest they fall.</p>
<p>The Lord has also led us from the local churches in Romans 16 to the seven local churches in Revelation 1. The seven local churches in Revelation 1 are seven golden lampstands intensified by the seven Spirits (vv. 12, 4). Hence, we must pay close attention to the seven Spirits, which are the sevenfold intensified Spirit. The sevenfold intensified Spirit is Christ, who is making His home in us (Eph. 3:17).</p>
<p>The seven Spirits do not refer to seven different Spirits but to the one Spirit who is intensified sevenfold. A floor lamp with seven lamps can be used as an example. When bright light is not needed, it is sufficient to turn on only one lamp. If brighter light is needed, more lamps can be turned on until all seven lamps are on. At this point the light is intensified sevenfold. There are not seven lampstands but one lampstand with seven lamps, which result in a sevenfold intensified light. The seven Spirits are in us; hence, our spirit is intensified sevenfold.</p>
<p>Our urgent need is to let Christ make His home in us and occupy our whole being. In order for there to be a bright local expression of the church, the shining of the golden lampstand must be intensified sevenfold. If every saint lets Christ make home in him, the churches will shine as golden lampstands in each locality. Then the people in Tokyo, Osaka, and Tokushima will see one golden lampstand as the expression of the universal church, the unique lampstand.</p>
<p>We must not stop with experiencing the mingling of the Triune God with man; we must also let Christ grow and increase in us. Furthermore, we must daily experience renewing, transformation, the putting off of the old man, and the putting on of the new man (Eph. 4:22-24); we must let Christ be our person so that we may be one new man in Him (2:15). Hence, we must receive the Lord&rsquo;s word, because Christ with His riches are in His word. In addition, the ability to grow, to be renewed, and to be transformed are also in the Lord&rsquo;s word. The Lord&rsquo;s word in us can wash away the old creation and bring in the new creation, doing this until we are transformed into the same image as Christ to be His glorious and holy church that is without spot or wrinkle (2 Cor. 3:18; Eph. 5:27). This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR VISION BEING CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Our vision is Christ and the church. This vision will save us from many mistakes and from focusing on trivial matters, such as healing, casting out demons, baptism by immersion or sprinkling, and church governance by elders. We must ask ourselves: How much has Christ made His home in us? How much have we grown in life? How much have we been renewed? How much do we experience the mingling of the Triune God? Do we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s Word daily? Does His Word supply us as our food and drink? Are we being renewed and transformed by the Word? We must pay attention to these matters so that the glorious church will come forth.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Great Mystery-Christ and the Church &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
