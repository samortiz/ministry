   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING TO SPEAK WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT OTHERS CAN UNDERSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Tonight we want to say that, when we speak God s word in the meetings, we must learn a basic skill, that is, to coordinate with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our meeting is an assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not a meeting of one person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we must learn to coordinate with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just as in basketball or soccer, there is no way for you to play by yourself, keeping the ball for a long time before you pass it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then the other player politely says thank you as he receives the ball, and he plays until the others doze off, still not passing the ball.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He does not care if others are bored, sighing, or dragging their feet; he fully enjoys playing by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please remember, we have come to a meeting, and in the meeting there is only one ball the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ball we are playing is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We move according to this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not keep the ball too long in your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who know how to play receive it quickly and also pass it quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After dribbling two or three times, they make a basket.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our meeting we have to learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not dribble the ball too long.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If there is such a player, surely the coach would not like to spoil the game by using him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I want to point out a few mistakes made in the last few days.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some people just love to speak in the meetings, and whenever they do so, they get off the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course, we treasure a person who is willing to stand up to speak in the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, he should be sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When others are not responding, he should quickly stop speaking and not be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then there are those who not only get off the subject when they speak, but also go around in circles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They do not care a bit for others ears, nor are they concerned whether others are listening.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They speak with their old tone and accent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Out of ten words people can only understand three, yet they still continue to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You all know that I am from Shantung.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even today, I still carry the Shantung accent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praise the Lord, having practiced for fifty years, I have nearly gotten rid of half of my native accent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1933, when I first went to Shanghai, after the first week the brothers arranged a conference, asking me to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By that time, I had already realized that the old Shantung way of speaking could no longer be used.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I tried my best to speak Mandarin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although my pronunciation was a little poor, I kept one principle: I must speak words that others can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I must not use the native slang of my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My reason for mentioning this is not to discourage those who do not speak perfect Mandarin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What I mean is that you must try your best to practice speaking clearly, to raise your voice so that everyone can hear and understand what you are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must learn to care for others ears.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In principle, we must learn to coordinate with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>SPEAKING TO ONE ANOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>AND CARING FOR OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first verse in the Bible which proves that we need to coordinate with each other in speaking in the meetings is Ephesians 5:19, Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here it does not say, All speaking in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It says, Speaking to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that when you speak you must care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since it is to one another, there is a mutual relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When there is such a mutual caring there will be harmony and not confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>LEARNING TO UPLIFT THE SPIRIT IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The second verse in the Bible which proves that we need to coordinate with each other in speaking in the meetings is Colossians 3:16, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here the thought of speaking to one another is most precious.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It does not refer to ordinary speaking, but to teaching and admonishing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It continues, ...singing with grace in your hearts to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suddenly it turns from speaking to men to singing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we speak, we speak to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is man to man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then at a certain point, it is no longer man to man, but man to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The speaking up to such a point will surely produce hymns for singing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The word to in singing...to God is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the meeting, you speak and I listen, I speak and you listen.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everyone is speaking to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As our speaking becomes joyful and exciting, our words are changed into praises.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then everyone s speaking will change direction, and we will all be praising God together.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who have even a little experience of the meetings know that if for a period of time after the start of the meeting everyone speaks, then the spirit of that meeting will issue in everyone praising.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At this time, you and I should stop our speaking to one another, and our whole direction should turn to God and to praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all must learn to follow the flow of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must not stand up to speak after everyone has already turned to praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we do, the spirit in the meeting will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The more we speak, the more the brothers and sisters will feel suffocated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All our speaking and prayer in the meeting are for cultivating the spirit, uplifting the spirit, supporting the spirit, and causing the spirit to rise.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They should not kill the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is a fine work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those of us who attend the meetings regularly have no choice but to learn this fine work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Otherwise our meetings will not have a fresh flavor and, meeting after meeting, will cause people to lose interest.</S>
