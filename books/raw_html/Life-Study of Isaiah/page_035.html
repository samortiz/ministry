<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SALVATION OF JEHOVAH<br>TO HIS BELOVED PEOPLE AND THE NATIONS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGN OF CHRIST'S INCARNATION<br>GIVEN IN GOD'S DEALING WITH<br>THE UNBELIEF OF AHAZ, KING OF JUDAH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 7&#151;8</H1><P>In this message we will cover chapters seven and eight. Here we have the sign of Christ's incarnation given in God's dealing with the unbelief of Ahaz, king of Judah, who was under the dread of Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, king of Israel, who were defeated by the king of Assyria, who invaded the land of Judah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. GOD'S DEALING WITH THE UNBELIEF<br>OF AHAZ, KING OF JUDAH</H2><P>In 7:1&#151;8:8 we see God's dealing with the unbelief of Ahaz, king of Judah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Rezin, King of Aram,<br>and Pekah, King of Israel, Going Up<br>to Attack Ahaz, and the Heart of Ahaz Quivering</H2><P>Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, king of Israel, went up to attack Ahaz at Jerusalem, and the heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people quivered as the trees of the forest quiver in the face of the wind (7:1-2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah Sending Isaiah to Ahaz</H2><P>Jehovah sent Isaiah to say to Ahaz, "Be careful and be quiet; do not fear, and do not be fainthearted because of these two smoking firebrand stubs, at the burning anger of Rezin and Aram, and the son of Remaliah" (v. 4). The son of Remaliah was Pekah, king of Israel. Isaiah went on to say that their evil plan against him would not stand and that it would not happen (vv. 5-7). Then Isaiah said that Rezin and Damascus of Aram, and the son of Remaliah and Samaria of Ephraim would be shattered (vv. 8-9a). Finally, Isaiah said to Ahaz, "If you do not believe, surely you will not remain standing" (v. 9b). Here we see the principle that it is by believing that we are able to stand.</P>
