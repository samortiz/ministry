   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Sojourners and Pilgrims in this World</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must realize that we are sojourners and pilgrims in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As far as the moral world is concerned, we have come out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It wants to keep us, but if we stay, we will not be able to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The world wants to be closer to us, but if we allow it to come too close to us, it will be impossible for us to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The world wants to keep our people and our treasure, but if these things are kept in the world, we will not be able to serve our God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have been separated from Egypt, and our faces are toward the promised land.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The basis of that separation is the blood, the blood that has bought us back.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Egyptians have not been bought by the blood; the worldly ones have not been redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As redeemed ones, we have been transferred to another world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we must leave this world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose you go to a watch shop to buy a watch.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What do you do after you have bought it?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once the purchase has been made, you take the watch away.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I should not buy the watch and leave it behind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I should not tell the proprietor, "Here, you use it!"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Buying means taking away.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever there is a purchase, there is a taking away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I buy a sack of rice, the rice is taken away from the shop.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After one buys something, the purchased item is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Please remember that since the blood has bought us, we must be taken away from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once a person is bought by the Lord's blood, he should leave for the promised land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As soon as one is bought, he should leave.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who are not bought can stay behind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But as soon as a person is bought, he should leave.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once a person is bought, he has no choice but to go with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If I have been bought by the Lord, I must leave the world and go with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AREAS THAT REQUIRE SEPARATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>FROM THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may ask what we should separate ourselves from.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What things are considered the world?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What areas should we be separated from?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before we touch any specific item, we should realize that our heart and spirit are the first things that need separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a person's heart is set towards the world, it becomes futile to speak to him about anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is useless to try to be delivered from a hundred things if the person himself still remains in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, there must be a deliverance of the person, a deliverance of the spirit, and a deliverance of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Deliverance from matters comes later.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man must be separated completely from Egypt; he must be separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He should not be afraid that others will criticize him as being peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then there is the need to take care of some principles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In some areas we should be separated from the world, while in other areas we should maintain peace with it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have no intention to be contentious.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the family, in the office, and everywhere, we do not want to arouse controversy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Let us consider five specific things that need to be dealt with:</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A. Things Which the World Considers</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Improper for Christians to Do</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should refrain from anything that the world considers improper for Christians to do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our Christian life at the minimum should meet the standard of the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everyone in the world has set up a yardstick and a standard for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you do not meet this standard, you have failed them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When you do something, you should not give the Gentiles any ground to ask, "Do Christians do this?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If others say this, you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As soon as you are rebuked, you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Suppose you are caught visiting certain places.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Gentiles may say, "Do Christians come to places such as this?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are many places Gentiles like to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you tell them that it is wrong to visit those places, they may insist and argue with you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if you visit those places yourself, they will ask, "How can you also go to these places?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some matters are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the Gentiles do them, they keep quiet about it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if you do the same things, they will speak up.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, we must refrain from things that the Gentiles consider improper.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a minimum requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When a Gentile says, "Christians should not do such a thing," we should turn away from it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some young people are saved, but their parents are still unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sometimes these children ask for something from the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The parents may say, "Do you Christians want these things as well?"</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is most shameful for a Christian to find himself adjusted by the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Abraham lied and was rebuked by Abimelech.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is a most shameful thing in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must refrain from things that are considered improper by the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must stay away from things that the worldly people, the Egyptians, consider inappropriate for Christians to do.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must be separated from them.</S>
