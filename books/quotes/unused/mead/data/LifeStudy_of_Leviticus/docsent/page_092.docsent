   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE LAW OF THE TRESPASS OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 7:1-10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In my study of biographies and history, I have received much help from the living and practices of two persons, George M ller and Hudson Taylor.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>George M ller, a leading one among the British Brethren, rose up every morning to walk in the open air and to read the Bible and pray as he walked.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As he read, he prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He testified that from this practice he received the best nourishment, edification, knowledge, and building up in his Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The practice of Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, was very similar.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He also rose up in the morning to spend time with the Lord in the Word, and he testified of the nourishment he received.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I mention the practice of George M ller and Hudson Taylor because I am concerned for the Christian life of the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Christian life, spiritual birth is only the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a human being is to be raised properly and to grow adequately in every phase of life, he must be raised in a good home and attend school from kindergarten through high school.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the law according to the physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The principle is the same in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need a spiritual home where we can grow and a spiritual school where we can receive a proper education.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition, we need to behave ourselves, cooperating with both the home and the school.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the law according to the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we were regenerated, we received another life the divine life, the life of God which is different from our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether our natural life is good or bad, we need to forget that life and go along with the second life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this second life there is a law that corresponds to the five laws in Leviticus 6 and 7 concerning the enjoyment of Christ in five aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today, we need to go along strictly with this second life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do this, we will receive much spiritual benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every life has its own law and its own sense.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The divine life, therefore, has a law and also a sense.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To us today, this life is not objective but is altogether subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The divine life is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This life within us is subjective to such an extent that often we find it difficult to distinguish our original, natural life from our second, divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, it is a fact that the divine life is within us, and this life has a particular sense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some illustrations will help you understand what I mean by the sense of the divine life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before you were saved, you may have enjoyed a certain kind of worldly entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you wanted to participate in that kind of entertainment, you simply did so.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after being saved and regenerated, quite often you would have a sense or feeling within that would not agree with your participating in that worldly amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may then have felt that it was better to use the time to pray, and something within you the sense of the divine life would agree.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes the inner sense may not agree with your intention to spend a certain available time in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After further consideration, you may have the desire to visit your cousin to preach the gospel, and the inner sense may agree.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Praying and preaching the gospel are both good and holy things; however, the inner sense may agree with the latter and not with the former.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, you do not have the peace to stay home and pray, but you do have the peace to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such an experience tells you that now you have something which you did not have before you were saved the divine life with its law and its sense or feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you take care of this inner sense, the sense of the divine life, you will keep the law of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I would like to help you to make a decision, to make up your mind, to live and walk according to the law of the new life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You need to decide not to live any longer according to the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You are not what you were before you were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You are a new creation, a regenerated person, a member of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Immediately after their regeneration, some believers have not only the desire and the aspiration but even the ambition to be new, holy, heavenly persons.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But perhaps some of you have not yet made such a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am concerned that you will continue to live, act, and behave in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, I would urge you, even beg you, to make a decision that you will not be as you were in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because we are regenerated persons, we should be different in everything from what we were in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We were generated through our parents to receive the natural, human life, but we were regenerated by God to receive the divine life and thereby to become God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we need to live like children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you were adopted by the president, surely you would decide spontaneously to live and act like a child of the president.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to realize that we are children of the Lord of the whole universe, the One who is much higher than the president.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since we are children of such a God, we should behave as His children.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although we are the children of God, we may come to the meetings of the church in either a proper or an improper way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some may come to the meeting on the Lord's Day sloppily dressed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They may also come late and take a seat according to their preference.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Of course, the meeting is full of grace, and some grace may rain on them, but it is questionable how much grace they will receive and how much they will treasure it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Others may come to the meeting on the Lord's Day properly washed and dressed, and prepared not only in their spirit but also in their whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They may even come early, take an appropriate seat, and pray for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Surely they will receive more grace, and they will treasure what they receive.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They will receive spiritual benefit, and they will in turn be a benefit to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need all kinds of regulations in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some may feel that this is too legal, but here in the type we do have the laws, the regulations, for the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Let us now consider the various aspects of the law of the trespass offering.</S>
