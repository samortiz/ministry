(July 31)</p><p>When Dr. Stearns discussed the matter of leaving the denominations with Mr. Sparks, he was asked, "If you are truly under the headship of Christ, would you come under the Presbyterians?" This made Dr. Stearns clear about the matter of leaving the denominations.</p><p>We should speak to students about the church. We should let them know that we fellowship with all the saints and that we take care of the Body life. (August 2)</p><h2 class="head2">Among the Workers (August 2)</h2><p>If a worker cannot work together with another worker, there must be something wrong with his spiritual life.
