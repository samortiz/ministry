<p>(4) Does this mean then that we should segregate the children of God or decide which believer can have fellowship with us and which cannot? Who then could judge which one is an overcomer? Can we reject, therefore, the fellowship of those whom we deem unspiritual and unworthy of our fellowship?</p><p>The Bible has revealed the basis upon which we "receive one another." We must receive one another as "Christ also received" us (Rom. 15:7). Therefore, we can say that we receive a person because "God has received him" (14:3). For this reason God commands, "Him who is weak in faith receive" (v. 1). This command is clear, unequivocal, and draws a very clear boundary. To reject one whom God has received is sin, even though such a one is in weakness and darkness.</p><p>This does not mean that those who are defeated can have fellowship with God's children. Not only will worldliness, flesh, and sin cause the church to be loose in its character and fellowship, but even a little departure from His will and from the leading of the Holy Spirit will cause man to lose touch with God. An overcomer must not only be correct in outward position but also live a life in the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Who then is worthy among God children to choose or decide who can come into fellowship? According to our knowledge of the Bible, our duty is to examine only those who have moral corruption (1 Cor. 5:10) or who hold heresy regarding the person of Christ (2 John). Any difference regarding the explanation of the truth should never be the cause for division. Apart from these two reasons, we must receive all whom God has received in Christ.</p><p>(5) We must differentiate between the "sin" which hinders fellowship with God (moral or doctrinal) and the "sin" which cannot hinder fellowship with God. Unquestionably, adultery as well as the denial of the Lord Jesus Christ as the One coming in the flesh are sins which hinder fellowship. However, the "sectarian companion" or a wrong interpretation of prophecy are sins which do not hinder fellowship with God. This is a fact which you cannot deny. It is quite evident that many who do not separate themselves from what you call "evil companions" and who have a different interpretation of prophecy definitely have a very close fellowship with the Lord&mdash;even closer than we do. This clearly proves that "evil companions" and "evil doctrines" are not "sins" which hinder fellowship. It also proves, on the other hand, that even if one stands in a correct position regarding the church or the truth, it does not necessarily mean that he has an intimate touch with the Lord. There is one thing that is more important than an outward position or truth that is received through the mind&mdash;that is, to live in the Holy Spirit and not to yield to the flesh.</p><p>The fellowship among God's children is the fellowship with the Son of God. It is also a fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, regardless who it may be, one must live in the Holy Spirit in order to have fellowship. No place is ever found for the flesh in the Holy Spirit. It is excusable for beginners to be babes, but none should be babes for a long time. Actually, whether people are received or not can neither bring them into the fellowship of Christ nor drive them out of Christ. In fact, if one is in the reality of fellowship, he remains in fellowship; if one is not in fellowship, he simply is not in fellowship. The outward form does not count, only the reality. The Holy Spirit alone knows who is not rebelling against His authority, who is not grieving Him, and who is living by Him in Christ. Therefore, it is the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit alone, who can decide who is in fellowship and who is not. We are not qualified to do this.</p><p>We are assured of the Lord's mind in this: We should not receive anyone without judging his obvious sins or by neglecting his heretical doctrines. However, the decision as to who should be in the fellowship must be made by the Holy Spirit and not by us. Each individual must also bear the responsibility of examining himself before the Lord to discern whether he has a problem in the matter of his fellowship (see 1 Cor. 11:27-32).</p><p>On the basis of scriptural authority and the leading of the Holy Spirit, we have decided that if a man has not been received by us, he cannot have fellowship with us (Acts 9:26-28; Rom. 14:1-3; 15:7; 16:2; 2 Cor. 3:1; etc.). However, we are not saying that each one who has been received by us can have fellowship. Everyone must first examine himself before the Lord to determine if he is worthy to come and have fellowship. The only thing we can do is to separate God's children from the children of this world. The Lord has not ordained us to be the judge to separate God's children from each other.</p><p>(6) Therefore, in our practice, after a brother is received, we tell him that as far as we (those standing on the ground of the church) are concerned, we are satisfied, but as far as his status before God is concerned, we leave with him the responsibility to examine himself. Only those who have fellowship with the Lord are qualified to share the Lord's table. In every such meeting the brothers should make clear to all such responsibility and practice. Then no one would presume that since he is not excommunicated, he must be one who is in fellowship.</p><p>(7) Frankly, we have doubts about your present method of receiving others. Is the Holy Spirit the Head in every matter, or is man doing the receiving? Your practice of receiving others may have been living in the beginning, but through years of habit it may have become a set of rules. Hence, the root of our question here is whether man is receiving others or the Holy Spirit is exercising His lordship.</p>
