   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The condition of my sickness was actually more serious than it was in Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the Lord heard our cry and showed mercy to my weakness.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are studying it chapter by chapter one or two chapters each week .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During the week the brothers and sisters read the chapters at home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When they come together, each takes a turn reading a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then they have mutual exhortation and edification according to the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the practice of the past two weeks, it seems that this kind of meeting combines the functions of edification, Bible study, and testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Most of the brothers and sisters apply the exposition of the Scriptures to their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the Lord also leads some brothers to speak something on the side of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During the past two meetings, I have received much edification from the mouths of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some light is new to me.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But I am still not clear as to how this kind of meeting should be conducted.</S>
