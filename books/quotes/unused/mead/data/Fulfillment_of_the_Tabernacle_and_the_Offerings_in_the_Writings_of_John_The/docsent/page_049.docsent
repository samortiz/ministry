   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Speaking the Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to 3:34, Christ as the One sent by God speaks the words of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word translated "words" is rhema, which means the instant and present spoken word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It differs from logos, which means the constant word, as in John 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here also the Greek word rhema is used.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit is living and real, but rather mysterious and intangible and difficult for us to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Lord's words are substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First the Lord indicated that for giving life, He would become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we receive the Spirit who is life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The nature and essence of the Godhead is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 4:24 says, "God is Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this verse the word Spirit does not denote the Person of God; rather, it denotes the essence or nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the essence of a chair is wood, so the essence of God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit is God's essence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How is it possible for God's essence to enter our being?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is possible through Christ as the One sent by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As God's sent One, Christ is the first and foremost Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Concerning this, Hebrews 3:1 says, "Wherefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Apostle is the One who was sent to us from God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us so that we may partake of His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, as the Apostle, God's sent One and Ambassador, Christ speaks the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word Christ speaks is the rhema, the word that is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many of us can testify that when we handle the Word of God properly by exercising our spirit, the word that comes into us becomes spirit, and when it becomes spirit, it also becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the word is spoken, it is still the word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But after it comes into us, the word becomes spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then as we speak out the word that has become spirit and life within us, it once again becomes the word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After such a word enters into someone else, it again becomes spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way God, who is Himself Spirit and life, is spoken into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By this means God's essence is spoken into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word of the Lord Jesus is actually the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, when this word enters our being, God's essence comes into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This essence is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Have you ever heard that the Spirit is God's essence and that this essence is conveyed through God's spoken word?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am deeply saddened by the fact that many Christians do not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, concerning the Spirit, there is much confusion among believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Old Testament God spoke in diverse ways, in different ways, through the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But in the New Testament God speaks through only one person, and that person is His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regarding this, Hebrews 1:1-2a says, "In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the New Testament ministers of the Word are part of God's speaking in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul's speaking in his ministry, for example, was part of this speaking of God in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Likewise, today we are speaking the word of God in the Son, for we are all in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are not speaking the word of God outside of the Son; rather, we are speaking the word of God in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In our speaking we desire to be one spirit with Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Often before I minister the Word, I pray, "Lord, be one spirit with me in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, I want to practice being one spirit with You in the speaking of Your word."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I do not have the assurance that I am one spirit with the Lord, I do not have any desire to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be one spirit with the Lord in our speaking of the word means that we are truly in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the genuine speakers of the divine word of the New Testament are part of God's speaking in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today God the Father speaks in the Son, and the Son includes all the New Testament ministers of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What are we doing as we carry on the ministry of the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are speaking God into people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are speaking the divine essence into others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many of us can testify that as a result of listening to the genuine ministry of the Word, we receive the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We hear the word and receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then after the word has been received by us, it becomes spirit and life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Spirit is actually the essence of God becoming the very life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Any message that we listen to that cannot become spirit and life in us is not a proper message.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Such a message may be correct doctrinally or scripturally, but it does not convey the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The word in our ministry must be the very essence of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The unlimited Christ is from above, He is above all, He is loved by the Father, He has been given all things by the Father, and He has been sent by God as God's Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now we must see that this One speaks the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He does not speak His own word or someone else's word He speaks only the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This word is spirit and life as the essence of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In our speaking we need to be one spirit with the Lord so that we can speak the essence of God into others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we preach the gospel, we should preach the essence of God into sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we give a message, we should impart the essence of God into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whenever we minister the Word, we should impart the essence of God into others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This means that in the ministry of the Word we are stewards serving the saints with the essence of God as their nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As a waiter serves others with food, so those who minister the Word of God should serve the saints with the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The essence of God is conveyed to us through the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The all-inclusive, unlimited Christ is continually speaking the essence of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For this reason, all the speaking in the meetings of the church should be the speaking of this One.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This means that He speaks in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only He has come from above and is above all.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Only He is loved by the Father, has been given all by the Father, and has been sent by the Father to speak God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We today should not be separate from Him as we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, we should be joined to Him as one spirit and speak with Him so that He speaks in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Today the Lord is still speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He does not speak any word other than the word, the rhema of God, which is spirit and life.</S>
