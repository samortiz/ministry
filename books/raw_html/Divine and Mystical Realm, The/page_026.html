<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You for Your divine intention. You want to make us exactly the same as You are in life and nature but not in the Godhead. Lord, You have added Your divine life to our created, fallen, redeemed, and resurrected humanity. Lord, You have sanctified our crooked disposition to make us like You are in Your holy nature. Lord, You are still working until we are redeemed in our body to make us like You. Eventually, we will be able to say, “Lord, what You are, we are, and what we are, You are.” The only difference is that You have the Godhead. We thank You and worship You that we don’t have the Godhead. You are the unique God. You are the Triune God, processed and consummated. We have humanity plus divinity, and You have divinity plus humanity. What a wonder that God has humanity! The processed, consummated Triune God has humanity. Lord, open the heavens to us. We want to be in heaven to see all the things as You see them. Give us the utterance. This is absolutely a new culture in a mystical realm. We need Your language; we need Your utterance.<h2 class=head1>VII. TO OPEN THE SEVENTH SECTION OF CONFORMATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Consummation of Transformation</h2><p>Conformation is the consummation of transformation. Transformation is a gradual work to transform us into the glorious image of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18) that needs a consummation. We are still in the process of being transformed, but our transformation has not yet been consummated. The consummation of our transformation is our conformation to conform the transformed believers to the image of the firstborn Son of God—the first God-man (Rom. 8:29).<p>We need to see the difference between Christ as the only begotten Son and as the firstborn Son of God. Christ being the Firstborn indicates that many sons are following Him. In Christ’s resurrection three big items were produced: the firstborn Son was produced, the life-giving Spirit who is the transfiguration of the last Adam was produced (1 Cor. 15:45b), and all the chosen, predestinated ones were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3). What an outcome this was!<h2 class=head2>B. The Full Growth of the Processed Triune God</h2><p>Such a conformation is the full growth of the processed Triune God—the Father embodied in the Son and the Son realized as the Spirit—as the divine life in Christ (Col. 1:28) that grows in the believers unto maturity.<h2 class=head2>C. The Full-grown Man</h2><p>It is also the full-grown man at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13). The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ (1:23), which has a stature with a measure. Christ is all-inclusive and all-extensive, unlimited; He is the One who fills all in all. Such a One has a Body, and this Body is His expression. This Body has a stature, and the stature has a measure. Who can measure the stature of the Body of Christ, the fullness of the unlimited Christ? But our conformation to the image of the firstborn Son of God will be the full-grown man at the proper measure of the proper stature of the proper expression of Christ. The Body is the aggregate of all the believers who through transformation have been conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. This is the full-grown man at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Although such a measure is immeasurable, we can attain it through our conformation.
