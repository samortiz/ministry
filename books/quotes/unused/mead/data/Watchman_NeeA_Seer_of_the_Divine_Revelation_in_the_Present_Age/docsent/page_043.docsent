   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN MARRIED AND ENGAGING IN BUSINESS MARRIED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Watchman Nee was a teenager, he fell in love with a young girl by the name of Charity Chang.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Their two families had been friends for three generations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After Watchman Nee had turned to the Lord, Charity was still unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At times she ridiculed the Lord in Watchman's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This bothered him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How could he who loved the Lord marry one who despised the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the time he sought to be filled with the Holy Spirit, the Lord required him to give her up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He struggled for some time with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, the Lord forced him to give her up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time he made a thorough consecration of himself and his future to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He experienced the reality of Psalm 73:25 in a practical way, to have no other love in heaven or on earth but the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ten years later, after finishing her university education, Charity turned to the Lord and began to attend the church meetings in Shanghai in 1934.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through those ten years she was sovereignly kept by the Lord from marrying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the Lord brought her back to Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Charity's aunt, however, strongly opposed the marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She looked upon Watchman Nee as simply a poor preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, this caused Watchman to hesitate in going ahead with the wedding; but on the other hand, his mother was very much concerned for his marriage, since he was thirty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1934, during his fourth overcomer conference held in Hangchow, all the co-workers were present.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His mother grasped this opportunity to speed up the wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, immediately following the conference, the wedding took place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Charity's aunt was extremely unhappy about her niece's marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She made a threat that if Watchman Nee would not pay her the customary courtesy call she would cause him trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He would have surely paid her such a visit if she had not made such a threat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, her threats caused him not to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He felt he could not comply with her desire under such duress.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>People would think he was playing politics to please her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason he refused to do what she asked.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through this conflict, a great turmoil burst out in Shanghai caused by Charity's opposing aunt.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This caused Watchman a great deal of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, this marriage was the provision of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Charity was the helpmate he needed to take care of him in his sickly condition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She was the only one permitted to visit him during his twenty-year imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord took her away one year before Watchman died.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was God's sovereign arrangement that they had no children to burden them while undergoing such a long trial.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>ENGAGING IN BUSINESS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Watchman's second brother was a qualified chemist.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1938 he began a small pharmaceutical factory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was experienced in pharmaceutical production but was inexperienced in business management.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Watchman was blamed by his parents for helping many other brothers, but not helping his own brother in business.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Due to this family feeling, Watchman began to help his brother in the management of the pharmaceutical factory in the latter part of 1939.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At this time he was also burdened with the supply of his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He felt that some profit could be made through the business to meet their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He therefore picked up the full management of the factory and reorganized it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because of this unavoidable involvement, some brothers employed in the factory became unhappy with him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through this whole situation, Satan stirred up turmoil among the saints in Shanghai against Watchman.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This resulted in his inability to function in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the same time the occupation of the invading Japanese army compelled him to move the factory far to the interior, from Shanghai to Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Chungking was the Chinese capital during the Sino-Japanese war.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There he carried on the business and was also employed by the government.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the war, he brought the pharmaceutical factory back to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through the profits derived from this business, he was not only able to care for the need of a number of brothers and sisters; he was also able to purchase a training center with approximately twelve bungalows on Kuling Mountain, close to his hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 1948 a revival was brought to the church in Shanghai, and he resumed his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time he also handed over the factory to the work as an offering to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That act influenced many brothers and sisters to also hand over their possessions to the work.</S>
