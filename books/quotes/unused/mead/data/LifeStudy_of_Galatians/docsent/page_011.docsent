   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FOUR THE REVELATION OF GOD S SON IN US Scripture Reading: Gal 1:15a, 16a; 2 Cor 3:14-17; 4:3-6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a living Person, Christ is spiritual and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Apart from God s revelation of His Son in us, no human being would be able to see this living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Due to the shortage of revelation, millions of people have not realized anything of this Person, even though He is living, real, active, and aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the problem today is the lack of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christians may read the Bible and study it carefully, but see very little of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This also may be our situation even in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the beginning of the Bible to the end, especially in the New Testament, Christ occupies the central place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s revelation throughout the Scriptures is altogether focused on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, as we review our past experience, we shall have to admit that in our reading of the Bible we did not see much of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For seven and a half years, I sat under some teachers among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although I heard many messages and took note of the important points, I saw virtually nothing as far as Christ is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I saw a vivid picture of the great image in Daniel 2, a picture I can easily recall today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, during my years with the Brethren, I did not see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>VEILS KEEPING US FROM KNOWING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Concerning the revelation of God s Son in us, Paul covers two cases in 2 Corinthians 3 and 4, the case of the Jews in particular and the case of the unbelievers in general.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Jews read the Old Testament, they read it with their understanding veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 2 Corinthians 3:15 Paul says, But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you know what this veil is?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is the religion of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you contact orthodox Jews today and speak to them about Christ, you will realize that they are covered with a thick, strong veil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The same is true of Moslems and even of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, many of those in the Catholic Church who truly believe in Christ are covered with a veil of many layers, perhaps dozens of layers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One of these veils concerns the superstition that Mary is the mother of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These believers persist in saying that they must continue to pray to Mary, the so-called mother of God, because they think their experience proves that prayers to the so-called holy mother are heard and answered.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What a veil this is!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Seventh-Day Adventists are veiled by their observance of the seventh-day Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As you speak to them concerning Christ, you will find what a thick veil this ordinance is to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As you contact Christians today, you will find that virtually all Christians are veiled in some way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These veils keep them from seeing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although Christ is spiritual and mysterious, God has created within us an organ by which we can know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This organ is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In his subtlety, Satan has blinded people to the fact that they have a spirit, or has otherwise kept them from using their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, he entices them to use their fallen mentality, which is blinded, darkened, and hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 2 Corinthians 3:14 Paul says that the Jewish religionists are hardened in their thoughts Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>. To be hardened in this way is also to be blind and in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many Christians also are blinded, hardened, and darkened because they are covered with so many veils.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These veils not only frustrate them from knowing Christ, but often keep them from recognizing the church people as genuine Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some persist in considering us as a cult.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, the veils that cover today s Christians make them very touchy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If they are touched even slightly, they are offended.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The reason for this touchiness is that Satan, the subtle one, the touchy one, is crouching in their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Satan is lurking in the mentality of today s veiled Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What a pitiful situation that so many genuine believers in Christ are still veiled!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to apply this word about veils to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is crucial that we be on the alert, for it is possible for anything that is not Christ Himself to be used as a veil by the subtle one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Satan may use even the Scriptures or the law given by God as veils.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Romans 7 Paul says that the law is good, holy, and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But even such a good, holy, and spiritual thing in the hands of Satan can become a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This indicates that Satan can use even the highest spiritual gift to veil our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, it is possible for anything that is not Christ Himself to be a veil.</S>
