If he hears you, you have gained your brother&#151;v. 15.</li>		<li>If he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established&#151;v.16.</li>		<li>If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church&#151;v. 17a.</li>		<li>If he refuses to hear the church also, the vital group should pray by exercising the authority of the church, which is the authority of the kingdom&#151;vv. 17b-18; 16:18-19.</li>		<li>Dealing with such a situation by the vital group in harmony with the Lord in their midst&#151;vv.19-20.</li>		<li>With a forgiving spirit&#151;vv. 21-22.</li>		<li>By this way the vital groups live the God-man life as Christ did when He was living on the earth.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>To live the church life&#151;2 Tim. 2:22:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Pursuing righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</li>	<li>The kingdom life is practiced and realized in the church life&#151;Rom. 14:17.</li>	<li>We must live the kingdom life according to Matthew5 through 7; then we can live the church life:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>By pursuing:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Righteousness&#151;to take care of God's righteous way&#151;Rom. 14:17a.</li>			<li>Faith&#151;to take care of God's faithfulness.</li>			<li>Love&#151;to take care of God's heart.</li>			<li>Peace&#151;to take care of God's peace in producing the church for our relationship with others in the church&#151;Eph. 2:14-17; Rom. 14:17b.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Through the calling on the Lord out of a pure heart&#151;seeking nothing but the Lord only, without ambition or any other greediness.</li>		<li>Such a pursuing, existing in the vital group and abounding, constitutes the vital group neither idle nor unfruitful (John 15:5, 16) unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ&#151;2 Pet. 1:8.</li>		<li>Thus, the vital groups can live the normal church life, overcoming the degradation of the church, to constitute the Body of Christ for the consummation of the New Jerusalem, the goal of God's eternal economy:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>By exercising our regenerated spirit of power, love, and sobermindedness&#151;2 Tim. 1:7.</li>			<li>By holding in faith and love the healthy words received from the apostle and guarding the good deposit through the indwelling Spirit&#151;1:13-14.</li>			<li>By cutting straight the word of the truth&#151;2:15.</li>			<li>By enjoying the Lord in our spirit as the abiding grace&#151;4:22.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol>
