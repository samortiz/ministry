   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 17 through 18 continue, That you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By ourselves we do not have sufficient strength.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to be with all the saints to be strengthened with power to apprehend the dimensions of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to be strengthened to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Being filled unto all the fullness of God is the experience of the Body-Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To drink of the all-inclusive Spirit, we also need the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, it is wonderful that we are in the church.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are satisfied in the church life because here we have a foretaste of the New Jerusalem.</S>
