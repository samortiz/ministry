<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Having Passed through All the Frustrations,<br>Trials, and Disciplines for Their Purification</H2><P>The children of Israel were also made ready to take possession of the God-promised land by passing through all the frustrations, trials, and disciplines for their purification. The situation is the same in the church life. Although we do not welcome frustrations, trials, and disciplines, we surely need the purification that comes from our passing through these things. In addition to nourishing and cherishing us, God sometimes disciplines us for our purification. He may purify us through fire, which is a matter of purging, and through water, which is a matter of purifying. This also is an aspect of our being made ready to take possession of the good land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Having Been Prepared and<br>Having Received All the Prearrangements<br>for the Distribution of the Promised Good Land</H2><P>In Numbers 32 and 33:50&#151;36:13 God's people received the prearrangements for the distribution of the promised good land. This made them ready to take possession of the land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Now Being Ready to Cross the Jordan,<br>Enter Canaan, Consume the Inhabitants Thereof,<br>and Possess the Good Land Promised<br>by the Faithful God</H2><P>After all the foregoing, God's chosen and redeemed people were ready to cross the Jordan, enter Canaan, consume the inhabitants thereof, and possess the good land promised by the faithful God (Josh. 1:2-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Get Settled with God in the Good Land</H2><P>In particular, the people were ready to get settled with God in the good land. For them to be homeless was for God to be homeless. But for them to be settled in the good land was for God to be settled in the land, for they were to settle there with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Be Built Up with God<br>in His Divine Trinity as the Mutual Dwelling<br>for God and His Redeemed People<br>for the Expression and Testimony<br>of the Triune God on Earth among Men</H2><P>God's people were also ready to be built up with Him in His divine Trinity as the mutual dwelling for God and His redeemed people for the expression and testimony of the Triune God on earth among men. This was the destination of the children of Israel, and it is our destiny today. This is the complete, perfect, and eternal revelation of the divine Person with His economy.</P>
