   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Living under God's Covenant 1 No More Judgment of Death</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then God made a covenant with Noah, his seed, and with every living creature 9:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This covenant was mainly of one aspect that never again would death come through the judgment of the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The covenant here mainly typifies that in the church life there is no longer death, but life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The eight persons lived under that covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since we do not share their background, it is difficult for us to understand their feelings upon leaving the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose you were one of Noah's daughters-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After coming out of the ark, you would still have been fearful, thinking that after awhile the flood might come again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps you would have said to yourself, "Before the flood, I had assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I looked at the sky, and it was clear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was filled with assurance because the sky was clear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I had no fear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now, through the experience of the flood, I have no assurance at all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sky is clear, but perhaps the flood will come again."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The people had no assurance; they were threatened and fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This signifies that even after we have been saved and brought into the church life, we are still under the threatening of death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many are threatened by the besetting sins and the possibility of losing their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They hate their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Two weeks ago their sky was clear, but suddenly there was thunder and a great downpour that was the loss of the temper.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever this happens, they are frightened.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many saints have told me, "Brother, it is so good in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we don't have the faith or assurance that every day will be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am kind toward my wife today, but perhaps after two days I will lose my temper and be bankrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have no assurance and no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am full of fear."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some sisters have no peace with their husbands or with themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are under the fear that the flood will come again, that the death waters will come once more.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of this sense of threatening that Noah and the others were under, God made a covenant with them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God seemed to say, "Be at peace and be assured.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No flood will come.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There will be no more waters of death."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This signifies that we may be assured and at peace in the church life, for there is no more death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now in Christ there is no condemnation Rom 8:1 , no death water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are in Romans 8 where there is no condemnation, no flood, no death, and no judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we say, "No more," the more we realize that we have no death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not believe your feelings and do not listen to your convictions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Your convictions are not dependable; they are lies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You must live under God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not live under your feelings, your convictions, or any environment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's covenant declares that whenever the sky is cloudy, God will send a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When you see the rainbow, you know that the flood will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If your wife or husband has been so pleasant for two weeks and suddenly the sky becomes cloudy, do not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You must say, "Lord, send the rainbow."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not believe that your husband is going to lose his temper, but say, "Lord, You are faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You can take away the cloud and send the rainbow."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you say this, the sky will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not believe that you are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That is the lie of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not believe that you will lose your temper, that you will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you believe something negative and speak that thing, it will come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such prophecies are certainly fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you are afraid of something and prophesy regarding that thing, it will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not believe your weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do you believe them?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Are you now living under your weaknesses or are you under God's covenant?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The whole New Testament is called a new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A testament is even better than a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have a twenty-seven-book testament, a twenty-seven-book covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This covenant says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus" Rom 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This covenant also says, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness" 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do you believe this?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we believe it, we should say a strong, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The covenant also says, "Christ..nullified death" 2 Tim 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do you believe this?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do not look at yourself look at Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whenever you look at yourself, you will be trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not live under ourselves, but under God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have a covenant!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The covenant that God made with Noah was very short, at the most only half a chapter in length.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But our covenant has twenty-seven books.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Are you weak?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You must say, "No, I am no longer weak, because the covenant tells me that I can be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus' 2 Tim 2:1 , and I can boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me'" 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Spiritually speaking, I like the song that I learned as a child: "Jesus loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We may also say, "I am strong in the grace this I know, for the Bible tells me so."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We can declare, "I will be kept from stumbling this I know, for the Bible tells me so" Jude 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Some of you may not have the faith to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You may think that this is too much and ask, "How can you say, I will be kept from stumbling this I know'?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I dare not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If I were to say it tonight, surely I would fall tomorrow."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Yes, you would fall, simply because you prophesied that you would.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You would fall because you are living under your feelings, not under God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In His covenant, God says, "No more flood, no more judgment by water."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If you had been there at the time, would you have said, "Amen"?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I would have said, "Amen," over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When Noah saw the clouds, he had no need to be afraid, because he knew that the rainbow would come.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>So, when the cloud of temper arises, you can say, "Lord, I will not lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Send the rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I don't care about the cloud I care about the rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The sky is dark and the cloud is great, but a colorful rainbow is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Look at the rainbow."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When you say this, you call things not being as being through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This faith is not according to your imagination; it is according to the twenty-seven books of God's written covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>After the flood, the eight persons became people of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They were a covenant people.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In the church life, in Christ's resurrection, we are the covenant people.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We are not living under any of our convictions, considerations, or lies; we are living under God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We are now living under the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Are you weak?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Are you going to lose your temper, hit your wife, or love the world?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>You can say, "No, for the Bible tells me so."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We are secured, guaranteed, and protected by the promises in God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>These promises are great and precious, by which we may be partakers of God's divine nature and escape the corruption that is in the world through lust 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
