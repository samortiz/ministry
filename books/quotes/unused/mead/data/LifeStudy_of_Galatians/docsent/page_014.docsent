   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FIVE THE FORMATION OF PAUL S APOSTLESHIP Scripture Reading: Gal 1:15-24</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:15-24 we see the formation of Paul s apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we consider these verses, we need to see not only how Paul s apostleship was formed, but also how we can be formed into today s apostles, God s present-day sent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Life-study of Ephesians we pointed out that all the believers in Christ can be apostles, those sent by the Lord to fulfill His purpose and to carry out His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not hold the concept that we cannot be an apostle like Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The apostles are examples of what all believers should be.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul was not an extraordinary person, and he did not reach a state that no one else can attain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The concept that the apostles are unique is a Roman Catholic tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This tradition is related to the concept that Peter was the unique successor of Christ and therefore the first pope.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What a devilish concept!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Far from being unique, Peter is an example of one who followed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In particular, he is an example to Jewish believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul is a pattern especially for Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1 Timothy 1:16 he says, Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since Paul is our pattern, none of us should say that we cannot be like him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the brothers may believe that they can be today s apostles, the sisters may find it very difficult to believe that this also applies to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a help to the sisters, we need to point out that in God s household there are no daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has only sons, not daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ, the firstborn Son of God, has brothers, but He does not have sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that, according to life, all the believers, including the sisters, are sons of God and brothers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, in his Epistles Paul addresses the brothers, but not the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sisters, of course, are included in the term brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to life, all the believers are males.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, according to love, we all are females.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is our Bridegroom, and we are His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The relationship between the Bride and the Bridegroom is a matter of love, not a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Love is the unique requirement of married life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we are living sons of the living God, whereas we are the loving Bride of our dear Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How, then, would you answer this question: Are we, the believers in Christ, males or females?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The proper way to answer is to reply that according to life we are males, but according to love we are females.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul was made an apostle not according to love, but according to life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was as a matter of life that he was made a pattern for all the believers, the brothers and the sisters as well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that by taking Paul as our pattern, we all, brothers and sisters, can be God s sent ones today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul s status was that of an apostle, and ours should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, as we study the formation of Paul s apostleship, we are also studying the formation of our own apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All of us in the Lord s recovery need to be sent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the least, a young sister can be sent by the Lord to her parents to testify to them about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are you ready to be sent by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all should be prepared to be sent forth by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Concerning this matter of apostleship, our minds need to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, as we consider the various points in this message, we need to see how we can follow Paul s pattern and be formed into apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the points we shall cover are prerequisites for the formation of our apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I. SET APART BY GOD FROM HIS MOTHER S WOMB</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1:15 Paul says that God set him apart from his mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Greek indicates being designated or distinguished for a specific purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This setting apart took place before Paul was born.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we read about Paul being set apart from his mother s womb, we may have the concept that this was true of him, but not of us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was my point of view when I read these verses years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to my concept, Paul had been set apart, but I had not.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This concept, however, is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We were chosen, selected, before the foundation of the world Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Surely to be chosen from before the foundation of the world is more crucial than to be set apart from our mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since you have been chosen from before the foundation of the world, do you not believe that you were also set apart from your mother s womb?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Certainly you were.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we shall see, this refers to the carrying out in time of God s eternal selection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some teachers of the Bible have different opinions concerning the time that Paul was separated from his mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to one school of thought, he was set apart from the time he was conceived.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But according to another school, he was set apart at the time of birth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no need for us to split hairs concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The main point here is that according to His selection we were chosen by God in eternity, before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that we were chosen before the beginning of time, in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, there was the need for us, at a definite time, to be separated from our mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To be set apart from our mother s womb is related to the accomplishment in time of the selection God made in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It was necessary for us to be born at a certain time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We thank the Lord that Saul of Tarsus was not born a hundred years before the Lord Jesus, nor six hundred years afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was born at just the right time and in the right place, in the city of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was sovereign of the Lord that Paul was not born in Galilee, where Peter was born.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Both Peter and Paul were chosen before the foundation of the world, and both were set apart at precisely the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to God s timing, He caused these two of His selected ones to be conceived in their mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The same is true of us today.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We were selected from before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then God waited until the time was right for us to be born.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, regarding our birth God had His timing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We all were selected in eternity when Paul was selected; however, we were set apart from our mother s womb at different times.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, to be set apart from our mother s womb is to have God s selection carried out in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do not think that Paul was set apart from his mother s womb, but that you were not.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Because Paul was made a pattern, what happened to him should happen to us also.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whenever I recall my past, I worship the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As I consider my youth, I sometimes weep before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>How I thank Him that He caused me to be born at just the right time and in just the right place, more than seventy-four years ago in a small village in China.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We all can say, Lord, thank You for setting me apart from my mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I hope that we all shall have a full realization of this.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We need to realize that God set us apart in order to carry out His eternal selection.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This was true of Paul, and it is just as true of us today.</S>
