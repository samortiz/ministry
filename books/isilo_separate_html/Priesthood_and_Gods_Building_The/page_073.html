<p>The second category of words in the Bible concerns our living and conduct. When we read such words, we need to receive their teaching and correction. For example, there are many places in the Bible that speak of our need to be humble, meek, or watchful. Some portions tell us that we need to honor our parents, nurture our children, and deal with others properly in the Lord. There are numerous portions in the Bible concerning our living and conduct. When we read of such words, we need to receive their teaching and correction. These words also have the ability to enlighten us. When we receive their enlightenment, we are receiving the Lord&rsquo;s correction and teaching. After we receive the Lord&rsquo;s teaching, we should confess our impotence, saying, &ldquo;Lord, this is Your command, but I am unable to do it. I need to receive You into my being.&rdquo; We must confess our impotence to fulfill His words and teachings, and then we must receive the Lord as our power to fulfill them. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I cannot do this. I cannot make it, but I want to receive You into my being. Lord, be my inward strength to keep Your word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romans 12:11 says, &ldquo;Do not be slothful in zeal.&rdquo; As soon as we read this word, there is correction. We should not think that we have no need of correction because we love the Lord, know the Lord, and enjoy the riches of the Lord. According to experience, we need these teachings. Although we have been saved and are enjoying the Lord and tasting His riches, we still need to see that we are very slothful. We need the correction that comes through the Lord&rsquo;s word. We are short in meeting many of the Lord&rsquo;s commands. Even in reading the Bible and in praying, we are lacking in zeal. When we touch these words, we can pray, &ldquo;Lord, in my practical living I am still slothful and lacking in zeal. I cannot meet this demand. Only You are not lacking in zeal. Be the One keeping this word in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we read words concerning our living and conduct, we need to receive their correction, we need to confess our inability to meet these requirements, and we need to receive the Lord as our power. We must digest these words in this way. Even those who have been recently saved can digest words in this category with simple prayers. They can say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank and praise You. Your Word says that we should not be slothful in zeal. Supply me so that I am not slothful in zeal.&rdquo; Even this simple prayer will have impact. We must come before the Lord, confess our shortage, receive His correction, and acknowledge that we are unable to keep His word. Our willing and our running do not work (9:16), but we can still say, &ldquo;Lord, only You can keep these words. If You do not come into me, I cannot do it. I want to receive You into my being as the power to keep these words.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning God&rsquo;s Plan, Work, and Purpose</h2>
<p>There are many portions in the Bible that speak of God&rsquo;s plan, work, and purpose. Whenever we read such words, we need to praise Him. This also shows a proper attitude of fear before the Lord. We should praise God for His plan, His work, and His determined will to gain the church as His glorious purpose. After praising, we need to intercede. For example, when we read of &ldquo;the church...His Body&rdquo; (Eph. 1:22-23), we need to praise the Lord and say, &ldquo;You have purposed that the church would be Your Body. You are the Head, and the church is Your Body. We are joined together in life, just as the head and the body are joined together.&rdquo; Then we should intercede, saying, &ldquo;Lord, cause the church to be manifested as the Body, with the function and measure of the Body.&rdquo; This is to intercede for the church. After we praise and intercede, we need to inquire of the Lord, saying &ldquo;As a member of Your Body, how should I function? What responsibility should I bear? How should I be joined with others in Your Body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matthew 24:14, which speaks of God&rsquo;s purpose and plan related to the gospel, says, &ldquo;This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth.&rdquo; After reading this, we can pray, &ldquo;Lord, praise You that You have purposed and revealed that the gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth.&rdquo; Then we can intercede, saying, &ldquo;Lord, there are still many places where the gospel has not been preached. The gospel has not even been preached thoroughly in the areas surrounding my locality. Lord, cause the preaching of Your gospel to spread further to reach more places.&rdquo; Lastly, we can inquire, asking, &ldquo;Lord, what responsibility should I bear toward Your gospel? How should I participate in its spread?&rdquo; When we read portions concerning God&rsquo;s plan, work, and gospel, we need to praise, intercede, and eventually inquire of the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_072.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_074.html">Next</a> </body></html>
