   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prophecy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 12:10 Paul speaks not only of operations of power, but also of prophecy, discerning of spirits, various kinds of tongues, and interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prophecy is miraculous only in part.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The reason for this is that prophecy has more than one aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To prophesy is to speak for God and to speak forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes this speaking includes foretelling or predicting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Foretelling is miraculous, but speaking for God and speaking forth God are not miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Certain ones in the charismatic or Pentecostal movement like to hear predictions of the future.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1963 and 1964 there were so-called prophecies that claimed that the city of Los Angeles would fall into the ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those prophecies were even reported in the newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, those prophecies were not fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The kind of prophesying I appreciate is the prophesying in which there is the speaking for the Lord and the speaking forth of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This prophesying is to speak to others concerning the Lord and also to speak out the Lord to them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of prophesying is precious, and we all should learn to prophesy in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In chapters twelve and fourteen of 1 Corinthians the noun prophecy and the verb prophesy are used a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we read these chapters carefully, we shall see that here Paul does not use these words mainly with the meaning of predict or foretell.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, in these chapters to prophesy is to speak forth, that is, to minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To prophesy is also to speak forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This prophesying is useful for edifying the individual saints and for building up the church corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of us can testify of the help we have received through the kind of prophesying that speaks for Christ and speaks forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is built up through the speaking forth of Christ and the speaking for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, this kind of speaking is the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As someone is prophesying by speaking forth Christ and speaking for Christ, we are under the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result, we are nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This nourishment comes through the supply of the divine dispensing in prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A brother may give a short testimony in a meeting, but that testimony may be a speaking forth of Christ and therefore a dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our speaking provides the best opportunity for the Spirit to function, for the Lord to serve, and for God to work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our speaking is the key to the dispensing of the riches of the Triune God into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we are silent, dumb, the current of the heavenly electricity stops flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This causes the church to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all need to learn to speak so that there may be in all the church meetings the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Discerning of Spirits</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Discerning of spirits is the ability to distinguish the Spirit that is of God from those that are not of God 1 Tim 4:1; 1 John 4:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This gift is not miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Tongues and Interpretation of Tongues</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The last two gifts listed by Paul are various kinds of tongues and interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Tongues in verse 10 denote a proper language or dialect Acts 2:4, 6, 8, 11 either of men or of angels 1 Cor 13:1 , not meaningless voices or sounds.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The genuine and proper speaking in tongues is one of the many gifts of the Spirit, one of the many aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some say that speaking in tongues is first the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit, but afterwards becomes a gift of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to this understanding, as the initial evidence, every believer must have the gift of tongues, but as a gift of the Spirit, every believer does not necessarily have it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, this kind of teaching is groundless in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The New Testament makes it more than clear that speaking in tongues is only one of the many gifts of the Spirit, and not all believers have it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The interpretation of tongues is the gift to make the unknown tongues known, understandable 14:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the ninth item of the manifestation of the Spirit listed in this chapter.</S>
