   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUTLINE SIX DISCERNING THE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:14-17; 11:17-22, 27-34; James 5:14-15 In 1 Corinthians 11 Paul spoke a strong word to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 17 Paul said, "You come together not for the better but for the worse."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that the meeting together of the believers may be a loss instead of a gain.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"For the better" is for profit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"For the worse" is for loss.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 20 Paul said, "When therefore you come together...it is not to eat the Lord's supper."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 27 Paul said, "Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To eat and drink in an unworthy manner is not to evaluate the significance of the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord is for one to bring judgment to himself vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>29-30.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 29 Paul said, "He who is eating and drinking, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the body."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What was Paul's reason for such strong words?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Corinthians were coming to the table in a situation of divisions v. 18.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There were also parties, sects, among them v. 19.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a difference between a division and a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A sect is stronger than a division.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a division is formed, it becomes a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When a sect is named, it becomes a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Corinthians were also profaning the Lord's table; that is, they were making it common, the same as any other type of eating vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>21-22.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The basic principle of the church, the Body of Christ, is oneness Eph 4:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the oneness is damaged, the Body is divided.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Divisions damage the Body of Christ with respect to the carrying out of God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Divisions among Christians not only paralyze the Body but even cause the Body to be cut into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order that God's administration may be carried out, we must care for the oneness of the Body of Christ; having such a concern will preserve us in the Body and keep us from division.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Corinth the oneness was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When differing opinions come in e.g., concerning baptism , they will develop unless they are checked.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The development will lead to the formation of sects within the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually the development will lead to denominations e.g., immersion Baptist , sprinkling Presbyterian .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Corinthians were saying that they were of Paul, of Peter, of Apollos, and of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They had formed sects but not denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Being of Paul, Peter, Apollos, or Christ in a sectarian way annulled the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some among the Corinthians were approved 1 Cor 11:19.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Approved" means tested that the specifications have been met.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this verse, to be approved is not to be involved in any sect or division.</S>
