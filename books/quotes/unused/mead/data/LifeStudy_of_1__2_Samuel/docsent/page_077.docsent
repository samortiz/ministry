   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE HISTORY CONCERNING DAVID 5 PREPARED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE A MAN ACCORDING TO THE HEART OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 SAMUEL 16 2 SAMUEL 1 5 PERSECUTED AND TRIED BY SAUL 4 Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 28:3 30:31</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From the tragic end of Saul we can learn many things concerning God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The tragedy suffered by Saul was altogether due to his not being properly related to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is carrying out His economy on earth, and He brought Saul into His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead of participating in God's economy and cooperating with it, Saul was selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God wanted to build up His kingdom among His chosen people, but Saul usurped God's kingdom to build up his own monarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With David the situation was entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When David was anointed by Samuel, he had a clear understanding that he had been assigned by God to be the king, but he did not have any thought about kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After Saul was appointed to be the king, he was immediately filled with thoughts of the kingship, including how his son would succeed him 20:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this Saul was selfish and wrong to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He sought to build his selfish monarchy rather than the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, God gave Saul up and cut him off, tearing the kingdom away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 15:28 Samuel said to Saul, "Jehovah has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today and has given it to an associate of yours, who is better than you."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because Saul was given up by God, he was left alone, like an orphan, having no provision of help when trouble came.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though David was the most skillful and experienced fighter, he was of no use to Saul because of Saul's selfishness and envy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, because Saul wanted to do away with him, David was forced to go to a country that was Israel's biggest enemy 27:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>David went to the Philistines, in particular to King Achish.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Philistines gathered their camps to fight against Israel, David, who had become the bodyguard to King Achish, was in a dilemma of being one with the Philistines to fight against Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This dilemma was the result of Saul's selfishness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The people of Israel suffered defeat and were slaughtered also because of Saul's selfishness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But God in His sovereignty came in to deal with Saul and to rescue David from his dilemma.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to muse upon every aspect of this story, for it contains some lessons that we need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, from this story, this illustration, we should learn the lesson of crucifying our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Next, we should learn to condemn our selfishness our self-interest and self-seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, Saul was full of self, and from his tragic end we must learn to deny our self.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the Lord Jesus said, if we would follow Him, we must deny the self and take up the cross Matt 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At this juncture let us consider some further matters concerning David's being persecuted and tried by Saul.</S>
