   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5 HOW TO EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE OVERCOMING LIFE 2 I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>who loved me and gave Himself up for me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Galatians 2:20</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During the past few evenings we have seen the kind of life that we live and the kind of life that God requires of us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen the human way of victory and God's way of overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen what the overcoming life is and the characteristics of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Tonight we will speak on the way to experience this overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We will first consider a very important question: How can we enter into the experience of this life and how can we gain Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The verse we read tonight shows us the way to experience this life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us skip the first part of Galatians 2:20 and concentrate on the part that begins with "It is no longer I who live."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the life we should experience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is no longer I who live.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the negative side, I can say that it is no longer I who live.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the positive side, the overcoming life is "Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what we covered in the last few days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul's letter to the Galatians shows us that he attained, experienced, and entered into the experience of such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let us study the way he attained, experienced, and entered into the experience of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way Paul entered is the same way that we should enter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul's entrance was according to two phrases.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first phrase occurs before the portion in verse 20 that says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me," and the second phrase occurs after this portion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first phrase is "I am crucified with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the first condition for entering into the experience of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second phrase is "The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the second condition for entering into the experience of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through these two conditions, Paul gained Christ as his righteousness, sanctification, and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us consider these two things in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>SURRENDERING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"I AM CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first condition is "I am crucified with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why must we be crucified with Christ before we can have this overcoming life?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers and sisters, how many persons are living within us today?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We know that as soon as we believe, the Lord lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second Corinthians 13:5 says, "Do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We who have believed in the Lord know that we are not disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is a definite fact that the Lord is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But it is unfortunate that the Lord is not the only One who lives in us; we ourselves also live within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to experience the Lord as our overcoming life, we have to move out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to move out, which means that we have to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we move out, we will experience the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yesterday, a sister asked me how she could have the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My answer was that she had to relocate.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If two families live within one house and the relationship is not good between them, the only thing that is needed is for one family to relocate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not a matter of whether or not we have Christ in us, because the minute we believed, Christ began to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not a matter of whether or not He is in us; it is a matter of whether or not we have moved out.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As co-tenants, we are very unclean; we have committed all kinds of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As soon as we move out, everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, the first condition is that we move out; we have to relocate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's Word says, "I am crucified with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But is it not true that we have not succeeded, even though we have tried to move out many times?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have pretended to die many times, but we are still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have tried to kill ourselves many times, but we have not succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sometimes it seems that we have died, but we are still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have often tried to crucify ourselves, but we are still not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is the problem?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to take a closer look at this matter tonight.</S>
