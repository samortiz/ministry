<h1 class="title">FOREWORD</h1> 
<p>The following messages were given by Brother Witness Lee in May of 1984 at a Chinese conference in New York City. The present book is translated from the Chinese. It covers specifically the subject of Christ as revealed in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Christ is the center of the whole Bible. In particular, He is the subject of the New Testament. Our brother has released this timely truth in simple, concise words according to the pure revelation of the Bible and based upon his accumulated light of fifty years of study. They are now available for the enjoyment and appreciation by the saints. The outline of every message is printed at the beginning of every chapter. They are, in the author&rsquo;s words, the essence of the New Testament. May the Lord breathe His breath and anoint His Spirit upon these words.</p>
