<h1 class="title">GOD MAY BE KNOWN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 1:19-20</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God has manifested Himself among men and in everything related to man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The fact that there are parents proves that there is a God. Everyone was born with a certain set of parents. You should ask the question, &ldquo;Where did my parents come from?&rdquo; Continue with this question and you will have to trace it to God.</li>
	<li>The structure of your body is wonderful and complete, both physically and psychologically. You should ask how this came about.</li>
	<li>Many things which you encounter make you feel that they cannot be mere coincidences. You cannot help but believe that there must be the arrangement of God in it. These coincidences are the manifestation of God.</li>
	<li>Just study the universe a little, and you cannot help but acknowledge that God exists. Consider the laws of nature, the revolution of the planets, and the changing of the seasons. Who is the One that arranges and rules all of these? You cannot help but confess that there is a God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Creation manifests the existence of God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Scripture says, &ldquo;For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, being apprehended by the things made, are clearly seen, both His eternal power and divine nature.&rdquo; It shows that the existence of the universe is the manifestation of God.</li>
	<li>Here the Scripture says that the creation and existence of the universe especially manifest God&rsquo;s eternal power and His divine nature. <em>Emphasize that God&rsquo;s power and nature manifest God Himself.</em>
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s eternal power makes Him known. The earth is rotating in space, and man living on this earth is pulled by gravity. Both are a matter of power. Where does the power come from? This wonderful power is the manifestation of God.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s divine nature makes Him known. Many good things in this universe such as light, kindness, and mercy, all symbolize God&rsquo;s divine nature.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God is clearly seen
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All the foregoing examples show that God is clearly seen. Facts speak louder than arguments. All of creation is a strong proof of God&rsquo;s existence. How can a sensible person deny the existence of God if he is fair and honest within?</li>
	<li>If you still insist on saying that there is no God, then you are the fool mentioned in Psalm 14, which says, &ldquo;The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.&rdquo; Only a fool would say that there is no God, because God is so clearly seen.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>What should you do with God?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Appreciate that God&rsquo;s existence may be realized through His creation.</li>
	<li>Repent and turn to God.</li>
	<li>Believe that the Son of God is your Savior.</li>
	<li>Worship God in spirit.</li>
	</ol></li>
