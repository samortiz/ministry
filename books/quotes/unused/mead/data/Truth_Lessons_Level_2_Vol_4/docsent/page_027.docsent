   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Longing within Us to Envy for God against Worldliness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit within us longs to envy for God against worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>James 4:4-5 says, "Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore whoever determines to be a friend of the world is constituted an enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs to envy'?"</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eph 3:17 for God, causing us to be wholly for our Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is a jealous God Exo 20:5 , and His Spirit is jealous over us with the jealousy of God 2 Cor 11:2 , longing, jealously desiring, that we will not be His lover and make friends with His enemy at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, the Spirit works within us to separate us from everything other than God and to keep us for God Himself only.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit works in this way also to dispense into us the Triune God as the unique element that we may be sanctified and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>SUMMARY</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, the Spirit empowers us that we may abound in hope and be brought into the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also gives us love that we can love all the saints in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He also pours out God's love in our hearts so that we are confirmed and assured concerning God's love.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this spirit we have the boldness to speak concerning Christ and our experience of Christ in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the means for God the Father to strengthen us into our inner man.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we take the Spirit as our essence and our way, we will surely reach God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit also fights for us against the flesh that we may be delivered from the works of the flesh and live and walk by the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the result of our living and walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He also longs within us to envy for God against worldliness that He may separate us from everything other than God and keep us for Himself only.</S>
