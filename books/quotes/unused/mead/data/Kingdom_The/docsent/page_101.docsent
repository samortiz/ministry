   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FIRST CASE THE LEPER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first case concerns a leper who came to the Lord Jesus asking to be cleansed 8:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is very significant that this case is mentioned first.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No doubt Matthew deliberately recorded it first.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Leviticus 13 and 14, it was quite difficult for a leper to be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in Matthew 8 it was very easy: the leper simply came, asked the Lord Jesus to cleanse him, and He did it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What does this signify?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It signifies that all who would participate in the kingdom are lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You must realize that you are a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are all lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But hallelujah! the Lord Jesus can build up His kingdom with cleansed lepers!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus can establish the kingdom of the heavens with and among cleansed lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, He can change lepers into heavenly citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Don't you have the sense within that you are a leper?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Don't think that all the people who enter into the kingdom of the heavens are marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You need to realize that unless you are a leper you have no share in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The kingdom of the heavens does not call saints; it calls lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This realization will truly humble us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all must humble ourselves and say, "Lord Jesus, by my natural birth I am not worthy of Your kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By nature I am an unclean leper."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No one except the Lord Jesus can cleanse the lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are all lepers, but we have been cleansed by His blood and by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to Leviticus 14, the cleansing of leprosy required the blood of a bird and water.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The blood represents the blood of the Lord Jesus, and the water represents His life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are cleansed by His blood and by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Corinthians 6:9-11 says that the unclean people in a sense we may call them lepers have no inheritance in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we should remember the "but."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today, by the Lord's redemption we are no longer lepers; we are citizens of the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first case recorded by Matthew indicates that the citizens of the kingdom of the heavens are lepers who have been cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE SECOND CASE THE CENTURION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now we come to the second case, also not found in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the case of a Roman centurion, a Gentile, whose servant was sick 8:5-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The centurion asked the Lord Jesus to come and heal his servant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord Jesus indicated His willingness to come, the centurion said, "Lord, I am not fit that You should enter under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant boy shall be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it" 8:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It indicates the centurion recognized that the Lord Jesus had real authority over heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This case regarding authority is found in Matthew because it illustrates the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The kingdom is the authority of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the end of Matthew, the Lord Jesus said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Go therefore and disciple all the nations" Matt 28:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we go out to preach the gospel, we must go with the authority of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All authority is in His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The case of the centurion illustrates faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The people in the kingdom must be people of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is difficult to define faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although there is a definition of faith in Hebrews 11:1, we may read it several times and still not understand what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Stated simply, faith is the realization of what the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever you realize the Lord Jesus in a certain way, spontaneously you have faith as a result of that realization.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The centurion said that there was no need for the Lord Jesus to come to his house, because he realized that He was the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All authority was in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If He would say the word, everything would be well.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is an illustration of realizing what the Lord Jesus is.</S>
