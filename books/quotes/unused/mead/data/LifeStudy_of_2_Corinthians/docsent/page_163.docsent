   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-EIGHT FINAL EXHORTATIONS, GREETING, AND BLESSING 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 13:11-14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the last four verses of 2 Corinthians, 13:11-14.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A LIFE OF REJOICING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 13:11 Paul says, For the rest, brothers, rejoice!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Be perfected, be encouraged, think the same thing, be at peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the apostles are rejoicing v. 9 , they are able to exhort the believers to rejoice too.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not to be done in their natural life, but in the Lord Phil 3:1; 4:4; 1 Thes 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the New Testament, the Christian life should be a life of rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If your life is not a rejoicing life, your Christian life is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To rejoice includes more than just being joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is possible to be joyful without rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Joyfulness is something inward, but rejoicing means that our inward joy is expressed outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe that Paul would say that in order to rejoice we must use our voice; that is, we need to sound out our joy, to give it voice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, to voice out our joy is to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should rejoice either by singing, praising, shouting, or calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, to rejoice is to voice out our inner joy, to sound it out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This rejoicing is an important characteristic of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If our Christian life is normal, it will be a life of rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>BEING PERFECTED</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 11 Paul also appeals to the Corinthians to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Literally the Greek word rendered perfected means completed thoroughly, that is, repaired or adjusted, put in order again, mended, perfectly joined together, thus restored.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Greek it is the root of the word for perfecting in verse 9 and also the root for perfecting in Ephesians 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be perfected is to be restored, mended, repaired, and adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is to be brought back to the right position and restored to the right track so that we may be built up together with others in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The books of 1 and 2 Corinthians are books of perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The unique goal of these two Epistles is to perfect the damaged, distracted, and divided saints at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The believers there had been damaged, and the situation among them was unhealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, these two books were written to perform the necessary task of perfecting the believers, of bringing them back to a healthy condition full of life, of edifying them, and of equipping them for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All this is included in Paul s charge, Be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may regard the exhortation be perfected as active-passive in voice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Strictly speaking, this is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, it also contains an active element.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason we speak of it as being active-passive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is waiting to perfect us; however, we must take the initiative to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, the apostle was used to perfect the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that a perfecting work was being done.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Corinthians still had to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may liken Paul to a physician and say that he was ready to dispense medicine into the believers, but it was still necessary for them to take the initiative to receive the medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The doctor was at hand and the medicine was ready, but the crucial question was this: Were the Corinthians willing to take the medicine and be healed?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was the reason Paul urged them to be perfected.</S>
