   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE LORD'S CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here is a question.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord died on the cross, but what is the significance of His death?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who sent Him to the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everyone who reads the Gospels knows that the Jews sent Him to the Gentiles, and the Gentiles crucified Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I remember correctly, Pilate was a Spaniard.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can we say that the Lord Jesus died to bear our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was clearly crucified by man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Acts 2:23 Peter told the Jews that they had nailed Jesus to the cross through the hand of lawless men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here it says that it was the Jews who nailed the Lord Jesus to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But what did the Lord Jesus do on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before He went to the cross, He was praying in the garden of Gethsemane.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Was His prayer, accompanied with sweat like drops of blood, caused by man's persecution and opposition?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Was it because Judas was bringing men to arrest Him?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Or was it because He had to go to the cross to redeem us from sin?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Was it not because God made the sinless One to become sin for us and laid the sins of the whole world upon Him, so that He would bear our sins upon the tree?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There He prayed, "Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me" Luke 22:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the cross was something out of man's hand, if it was just the tool for some evil men to kill Him, and if there was only the human aspect to the Lord Jesus, then I would not like to listen to this prayer of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would not like to hear Jesus of Nazareth kneeling there praying to the Father to remove the cup from Him if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the past two thousand years, many martyrs and disciples of the Lord had a much stronger voice than He did when they were about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many martyrs, when locked inside cells and dungeons, prayed that the Father would glorify them, that they would rather die for the Son, and that they would rather testify to the Lord's Word with their blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If it had not been God who had commenced to place the burden of sins on the Lord at Gethsemane, and if it had not been God who had laid the burden of bearing our sins on the Lord Jesus, we would have to say that the Lord Jesus did not even have as much courage as those who believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the problem is that the cross has the aspect of man and the aspect of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man crucified the Lord Jesus on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the Lord said that no man takes His life away; He gave it up by Himself John 10:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man could crucify the Lord a thousand times or ten thousand times, but unless He Himself gave His life away, nothing could have been done to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man considers that He was crucified by man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We consider Him to be crucified by God to redeem sins on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to find out from the Bible what God did on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, let us read Isaiah 53:5-10: "But He was pierced because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>/ We all like sheep have gone astray; / Each of us has turned to his own way, / And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>/ He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>/ By oppression and by judgment He was taken away; / And as for His generation, who among them had the thought / That He was cut off out of the land of the living / For the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>/ And they assigned His grave with the wicked, / But with a rich man in His death, / Although He had done no violence, / Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>/ But Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>/ If You make His soul a trespass offering, / He will see a seed, He will extend His days, / And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The apostles quote Isaiah 53 many times in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The One spoken of in this passage of the Scriptures is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What did the prophet say when he wrote this portion of the Scripture?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The last sentence in verse 4 says, "We ourselves esteemed Him stricken, / Smitten of God and afflicted."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the beginning, the prophet thought that He was smitten and stricken by God, that He was punished for His own sins and smitten by God for His transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But in verse 5, there is a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God showed him a revelation by means of the word but.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We think that He was merely suffering from punishment and smiting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But He was not suffering from punishment and smiting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"But He was pierced because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>/ We all like sheep have gone astray; / Each of us has turned to his own way" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The next sentence is very precious, "And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him" v. 6 . This is what the Lord has done.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can see that there is the aspect of man to the cross and there is the aspect of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although it was the hands of man that nailed the Lord Jesus up, manifesting man's hatred for God, it was also God who had laid all of our sins upon Him and crucified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The cross was God's doing; it was something that Jehovah accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What happened at the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>/ By oppression and by judgment He was taken away; / And as for His generation, who among them had the thought / That He was cut off out of the land of the living/For the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To be cut off out of the land of the living is to die.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who stood by the cross at the time the Lord was crucified marveled and wondered why this man was being crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They did not know the reason why such a thing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The prophet said that "He did not open His mouth," and that He is brought "like a lamb that is led to the slaughter /And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Who knew that He was cut off out of the land of the living for the sin of the people?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Who knew that it was God working on Him to accomplish the work of redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The cross was the way that the Lord accomplished redemption through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Verse 9 says, "And they assigned His grave with the wicked,/But with a rich man in His death,/ Although He had done no violence,/Nor was there any deceit in His mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verse 10 is very precious: "But Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief./If You make His soul a trespass offering."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The cross is a work that God did.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It was God Himself who bore our sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He solved our problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Never give any credit to Judas for delivering the Lord Jesus to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Never think that without Judas the Lord would not have been able to be the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even if there had been a thousand or ten thousand Judases, it would still be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It was the Lord Jesus Himself who bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the Lord Jesus was praying in the garden of Gethsemane, He may have seemed like the weakest of all men, without any courage.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He prayed for the Father to take the cup away from Him Luke 22:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But when He came out from the garden and met many evil men, He said, "I am," and "they drew back and fell to the ground" John 18:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Please remember that He did not fall while being confronted with man's evil.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>On the contrary, He caused them to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>While He was at Gethsemane, considering the suffering involved in bearing man's sins, how the sinless One would be made sin, and how He was to take upon Himself the judgment of sin, He prayed for the cup to be removed from Him if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Had it not been for the question of redemption, the Lord Jesus would not have even matched a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>How brave were the many Christian martyrs when they marched to the lions' den.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But the Lord Jesus pleaded to have the cup removed from Him if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Physically speaking, the Lord Jesus was vastly different from all the martyrs.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But for redemption, for solving the problem of sin, for God to come to man and bear man's sin, even He had to ask for the removing of the cup if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Bible says that it was Jehovah that made Him an offering for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It was Jehovah who laid on Him the iniquity of us all.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It was something Jehovah did.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The cross was the work of God; it was not the work of man.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The cross is God Himself coming to earth to bear man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The cross is not the crucifixion of the Son of God by man.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Do you remember what the Bible says about the sixth to ninth hours?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The sun's light failed Luke 23:44-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Jews could mock Him, and the Gentiles could chastise and shame Him, but the sun was beyond the Jews' control.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Gentiles did not have the authority to manipulate the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Man could clamor and trumpet, but the earthquake was not something that Pilate could summon.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Why was the sky darkened?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>These phenomena happened because God Himself had come to bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This was not something done by man.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If it had been done by man, would God have added to His Son's pain when He was hanging on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Would God not have sent twelve companies of angels to come and rescue Him?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Such would indeed have happened had it not been for the redemption for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We thank and praise God that His Son came to redeem us from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This was why He said, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>No believer throughout the past two thousand years has ever said these terrible words when they died.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>For two thousand years, whether the believers died in peace or in woe, they were more bold than He was.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Why was the Son of God rejected there by God?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If it had merely been man's hand and man's crucifixion, that would have been the time He needed God's presence even more.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When man plotted to persecute and kill Him, God should have manifested His presence more.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>That was the most crucial moment.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>God should have been with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Why did God leave Him instead?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It was solely because the Son of God had become sin and had borne the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>That was the reason He cried, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>God had forsaken Him.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We who have believed in the work of redemption know that the work of the cross was for Him to be judged by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The cross of the Lord shows us how evil sin is and how much of a price God has paid for the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Besides Isaiah 53, another clear testimony of the Scripture can be found.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In Romans 3:25, God set forth Christ "as a propitiation place."</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This also shows clearly that the work was done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Deuteronomy 21:23 tells us that he who is hanged on a tree is accursed of God.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>When the Lord was hanging on the cross, He was not accursed of man.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Rather, He was accursed of God.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>That is why He can deliver us from the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>First John 4:10 says that God loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation concerning our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>It was God who sent His Son to be a propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>It was not man who crucified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Second Corinthians 5:21 also says, "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf."</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>This was something that God did.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>The cross is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>It was God who sent the Lord Jesus to pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Acts 2:23 mentions both the aspect of God and the aspect of man.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>"This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed."</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The Lord Jesus was killed by the Jews through the hand of lawless men.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>However, such a death was according to the determined counsel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>This shows us that everything was done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>We have sin, and sin can only be taken care of by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>For this reason, God came to the world to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>While He was a man, He was indeed righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>But this righteousness was not imputed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>It was the death of the Lord Jesus that delivered us from the curse of the law Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>He did not deliver us from sin while He was living, but when He died.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>On the cross, it was God who crucified Him, rather than man.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Man's hand is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>It was God who took the opportunity to make manifest man's sin.</S>
