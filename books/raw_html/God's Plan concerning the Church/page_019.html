        <h2 class="head1">THE FACTORS OF OUR BLESSING</h2>
<p>In every locality the Lord has blessed us because of three factors: first, we emphasize spirituality; second, we pay attention to the ground of the church; third, we emphasize coordination. The second item, the ground of the church, entirely upholds the first and the third items. If we were to take away the ground of the church, I am afraid that we would not have any blessing. Without the ground, although we may be spiritual, our spirituality will not serve any practical purpose. Also, without the ground there can be no practical expression of coordination. I would like to ask those who pay much attention to spirituality how much coordination they have in reality. This is the reason that they repeatedly give messages that are accurate and spiritual but do not see much result. This can be likened to a person who draws water from a well but does not have a vessel to contain the water; hence, it is continually poured out upon the ground. The reason the water cannot be preserved but instead ends up on the ground is that there is no vessel to contain it. Since we pay attention to the ground of the church, we are able to retain the small amount of blessing that God has given us. If we were to give up the ground of the church, we would be like a broken &ldquo;teapot&rdquo; and the &ldquo;tea&rdquo; would completely escape. If the ground of the church is the truth, we cannot give it up. Rather, we should hold it in a balanced way. Spirituality is important, and the fullness of Christ is central; however, we cannot give up the ground of the church and just focus on spirituality and the fullness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR GROUND, OUR PRACTICE, AND OUR ATTITUDE</h2>
<p><em>Question: What are you?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is better to answer this question according to three aspects: our ground, our practice, and our attitude. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, I will list several items with each aspect.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Ground</h2>
<p>1. We are neither the Roman Catholic Church nor a Protestant church.</p>
<p>2. We are neither the so-called &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; nor &ldquo;open&rdquo; Brethren.</p>
<p>3. We are not a small free group that has left the Catholic Church or the Protestant churches, which do not have the proper ground.</p>
<p>4. We are not another sect or denomination.</p>
<p>5. We are simply a group of believers who are saved by grace, have left and reject Christian organizations and free groups, and have returned to the ground of the church to meet together, worship God, and serve the Lord.</p>
<p>6. The New Testament clearly reveals that the ground of the church is local. It is the ground of oneness in every locality. Hence, our returning to the ground of the church is our returning to the ground of oneness in every locality.</p>
<p>7. We do not stand on any ground of organized Christianity, which is a divisive ground, nor do we linger on any free grounds, which are scattered grounds. We have returned to the original ground of the church, which is the ground of oneness. According to Old Testament typology, we do not remain in Babylon or anywhere between Babylon and Jerusalem; we have returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>8. We do not consider only ourselves to be &ldquo;the local church&rdquo; in a locality. Rather, we acknowledge that we are a part of the local church in a particular locality. We are standing on the ground of the local church in every place, which is the ground of the oneness of the church. We are also coordinating in service according to the principle and nature of the local church in order to have the proper living of the Body of Christ and to manifest the life of Christ for the testimony of the church.</p>
<p>9. We do not belong to any Christian organization or denomination, nor are we involved with any Christian organization or denomination. We are simply believers outside of any sect or denomination, and we are standing on the ground of the oneness of the church in every place as the Lord&rsquo;s testimony of the church.</p>
<p>10. We do not have any designation. &ldquo;Church Assembly Hall&rdquo; is merely the way we identify the place where we meet; it is not our designation. Therefore, it is wrong for others to call us the brothers and sisters of the &ldquo;Assembly Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11. We do not have a special creed. Except for the one faith by which we are saved (Eph. 4:5), we do not consider any truth, or any interpretation of the truth, to be our creed.</p>
<p>12. We do not have a special fellowship. Our fellowship includes all the believers who have been redeemed by the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood and have the life of God, regardless of the Christian group that they belong to or what view that they hold concerning the truth.</p>
<p>13. We serve the Lord on the ground of locality in every place, but we are not isolated from one another; we are not without the universal fellowship. We fellowship with all the believers who stand on the ground of the church in every place.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Practice</h2>
<p>1. We emphasize the testimony of the reality of the church as well as the ground of the practicality of the church. We have the outward ground of the practicality of the church to match the inward testimony of the reality of the church, just as the Israelites in the Old Testament had the outward Tent of Meeting to match the inward Ark (Exo. 40:1-3, 34).</p>
<p>2. We do not want to set up &ldquo;our meeting&rdquo; in every place; rather, we would like to meet and serve the Lord on the ground of the oneness of the church with all those who have forsaken the denominations and sects.</p>
<p>3. We would like to have fellowship with all the brothers and sisters in the denominations and in the Catholic Church, but we will not participate in any denomination, sect, or organized group that is outside of the ground of the local church, the ground of oneness.</p>
<p>4. We accept different views as long as they do not compromise the faith of salvation. However, we cannot tolerate division.</p>
<p>5. We are willing to meet and serve the Lord on the ground of the oneness of the church with any group of believers who are willing to not be divided or to stop their division, regardless of what views they may hold.</p>
<p>6. We receive all believers, including the saved ones in the Catholic Church, who have different opinions but are not involved in any sin that God condemns.</p>
<p>7. We let the Holy Spirit bear responsibility for spiritual fellowship. We have received some believers who may still have problems with the Lord in their spiritual fellowship. We cannot take responsibility for this. Only the Holy Spirit can be responsible. We can only receive them according to their status of being saved. Only the Holy Spirit can be responsible for their fellowship with the Lord in the spirit and their being in the fellowship of the Body. On the one hand, we receive them; on the other hand, we let the Holy Spirit take responsibility for their spiritual fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Attitude</h2>
<p>1. We do not recognize the Roman Catholic Church or the Protestant churches.</p>
<p>2. We acknowledge that those who are saved in the denominations and sects, including in the Catholic Church, are our brothers and sisters in the Lord and are members of the Body of Christ, even though they have lost the ground of the church. They are part of the church, but they are not on the proper ground of the church. Those who know the truth cannot acknowledge the ground of the Catholic Church as the ground of the church, even though there are indeed saved ones in the Catholic Church who are godly, love the Lord, and are spiritual. Similarly, there are many saved and spiritual ones in the Protestant churches, but their ground is not proper.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FINAL WORD</h2>
<p>The intention of this fellowship is to help the seeking ones understand the ground of the church; we have no intention to argue with anyone. We are open to criticism, but we do not like to argue. We would rather present what we consider as proper to the seeking believers in a straightforward way without hiding anything. Please forgive us for the frankness and bluntness of our words. What we can do is truly limited. May the Lord have mercy and pour out His blessing.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
