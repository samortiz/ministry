<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROPHECY<br>OF THE SECOND "SEVEN"&#151;<br>OF THE SEVEN SEALS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rev. 4:2-3; 5:1-7; 6:1-17; 8:1-2</H1><P>In this series of messages, we are burdened to see the prophecy of the four "sevens" in the Bible. In the previous message, we saw the prophecy of the first "seven"&#151;the last week of the seventy weeks in Daniel 9:24-27. This is a prophecy concerning the consummation of the age.</P><P>We also saw that the Lord Jesus prophesied concerning the consummation of the age in Matthew 24:32-33: "But learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near. So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors." The Lord's illustration here concerning the fig tree, which signifies the nation of Israel, covers three items: 1) becoming tender signifies the coming back of life; 2) putting forth leaves signifies the outward activities; 3) summer signifies the time of the restoration of the nation of Israel (Acts 1:6). The fig tree, the nation of Israel, passed through a long "winter" from the first century to A.D. 1948, when the nation of Israel was re-formed. That was the fig tree becoming tender, the coming back of life. In 1967 the city of Jerusalem was taken back by Israel (Luke 21:24). I consider this as the putting forth of leaves, the outward activities. Because these two things have taken place, we know that the summer is near, the time of the restoration of the nation of Israel, the age of the restored kingdom (Luke 21:30-31), which will begin at the Lord's second coming.</P><P>Another item that needs to take place before the Lord comes back is the rebuilding of the temple. In Matthew 24:15 the Lord speaks of "the abomination of desolation, spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place." This abomination refers to Antichrist's image set up in the temple of God as an idol (Rev. 13:14-15; 2 Thes. 2:4) at the beginning of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21). This means that the temple must be rebuilt before the great tribulation begins. According to recent news, a number of Jews in Israel are preparing for the rebuilding of the temple and for the priestly service in the temple.</P><P>In the previous message, we saw that according to Daniel 9, Antichrist will make a covenant with Israel at the beginning of the seven years of the last week of the seventy weeks, and in the middle of the week he will break the covenant. The last week will be cut into two halves by his breaking of this seven-year covenant with Israel. The second half of three and a half years will be the time of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21, 15). The overcomers will be raptured before the great tribulation, while the majority of the believers will be raptured at the end of the great tribulation. Since we know all these things, we need to watch and be ready for the Lord's appearing.</P><P>We have already seen the fulfillment of the Lord's prophecy regarding Israel in Matthew 24, which the Lord said had to take place before the consummation of the age. In Romans 9:27-28 Paul said, "And Isaiah cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved; for the Lord will execute His word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short." Paul said that the Lord would cut His word short in order to fulfill His prophecy in a rapid way. I believe that the present problems in the Middle East are part of the cutting short of the Lord's word. Today we are in a very critical time. When there is news that a strong man signs a treaty of seven years with Israel, what shall we do? We have to prepare ourselves to be raptured. Now we want to go on to see the prophecy of the second "seven"&#151;of the seven seals in the book of Revelation.</P>
