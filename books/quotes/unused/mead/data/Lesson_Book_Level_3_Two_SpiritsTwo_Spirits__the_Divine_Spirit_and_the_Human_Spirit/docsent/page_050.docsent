   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. After the Fall</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not long after God created man, man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan entered into the body of man through the fruit of that tree Gen 3:6 , for the fruit, we know, entered man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Satan entered man's body, he utilized it as a base to take over the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man as a human being or soul, came under the influence and control of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The soul was then damaged and became the self.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the body became the flesh, it damaged, influenced and even led the soul into captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consequently, the soul became the self.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have pointed out in chapter two of The Parts of Man that Luke 9:25 and Matthew 16:26 prove that the soul of fallen human beings is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now let us see the condition of man's spirit as a result of the Fall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the Bible clearly shows that Satan entered into man's body, using it as a base to mingle himself with the soul, we cannot find one hint in the Scriptures that Satan has ever entered man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is very interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not one verse shows that Satan has any ground in man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It seems that God must have drawn a boundary line, telling Satan to stop and go no further.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan may be in man's body and soul, but not in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only one verse of Scripture says that man's spirit was defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second Corinthians 7:1 speaks of the filthiness of flesh and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 2:1 and Colossians 2:13 tell us that we were dead in trespasses and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This certainly cannot mean that we were dead in body or soul, for the fact is that our bodies are still alive and our souls are still exceedingly active!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, it must mean that we were deadened in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fallen man's spirit has been defiled and even deadened, but it has never been taken over by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>C. In Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we received the Lord Jesus as our personal Savior, we believed in Him as the One who died for our sins and thus received forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we were justified and reconciled to God by His death Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be reconciled to God means that all problems between us and God have been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, we who were deadened in spirit have been quickened or made alive in the spirit Eph 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the redeeming blood of Christ, the conscience of our spirit and of our heart has been cleansed Heb 9:14; 10:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All filthiness has been purged away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But something more wonderful has happened: Christ, the Lord Spirit, has entered into our spirit as our life to make our deadened spirit alive!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When He entered our spirit, we received another life, the life of God, and were regenerated John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ, as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 is now in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 , not in our soul.</S>
