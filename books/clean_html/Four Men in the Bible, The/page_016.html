<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING DISTRACTED BY DOCTRINES,<br />
ORDINANCES, PRACTICES, OR TONGUES</h2>
<p>Regrettably, there are many distractions in Christianity. Christianity has many doctrines that are seemingly good but in reality are distractions. Christianity also has many ordinances, practices, and rituals that have become a form of bondage and restriction. The Pentecostal movement rose up in Christianity at the end of the nineteenth century because Christianity was full of doctrines, empty teachings, rituals, and ordinances, all of which were without life. The appeal of the Pentecostal experience was a reaction against this deadness. This movement, however, eventually went to an extreme, emphasizing the matter of speaking in tongues and teaching that a believer must speak in tongues in order to receive the Holy Spirit, be filled with the Holy Spirit, and have an overcoming living.</p>
<p>The Bible does record experiences of speaking in tongues, and I do not oppose genuine tongue-speaking, but I do not believe that many of the experiences of so-called tongue-speakers today are genuine. Thirty-six years ago I was influenced by the Pentecostal movement, and I spoke in tongues repeatedly. I even helped others to speak in tongues. However, I realized very quickly that it was meaningless, and I abandoned it. I have spent much time to study the matter of speaking in tongues and am confident that much of the current practice of speaking in tongues is false.</p>
<p>Tongues in the Bible refer to a dialect, either angelic or human; however, many so-called tongue-speakers have reduced this to the repeated use of a few sounds. But what dialect only relies on a few sounds? The tongues spoken of in the Bible involved much more than repeating &ldquo;<em>di di da da.</em>&rdquo; Many who promote this practice are deceiving God&rsquo;s children. Some even teach that a person who does not speak in tongues is not saved. Others teach that it is possible to be saved without speaking in tongues but that it is not possible to receive the Holy Spirit without at least some &ldquo;<em>di di da da</em>&rdquo; experience of speaking in tongues. Both teachings are absolutely wrong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MANY SPIRITUAL MEN BEING<br />
AGAINST SPEAKING IN TONGUES</h2>
<p>All over the world today, wherever there are Christians, there are people who have been helped by the books of Brother Watchman Nee. However, Brother Nee never spoke in tongues. Not only did he never speak in tongues; he was the first among Chinese Christians to tell people it was a doctrinal error to say that one must speak in tongues in order to receive the Holy Spirit. When I first arrived in Tientsin and Beijing to work in these two cities in 1936, I went to learn about speaking in tongues and to lead others to speak in tongues. When Brother Nee heard about this in Shanghai, he immediately sent me a telegram with the words of 1 Corinthians 12:30: &ldquo;Do all speak in tongues?&rdquo; He did not speak in tongues, and he did not believe that all Christians needed to speak in tongues. Brother John Sung, who was the most powerful evangelist among Christians in China thirty years ago and who brought many to salvation, opposed this even more. If he saw anyone uttering &ldquo;<em>di di da da</em>&rdquo; sounds, he would say that it was of the devil. He was altogether against this so-called Pentecostal experience.</p>
<p>Over the past few centuries, many servants who were greatly used by the Lord never spoke in tongues. Charles Spurgeon and D. L. Moody were both influential preachers in the nineteenth century, but they never spoke in tongues. Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis, who was considered to be a very spiritual person in the twentieth century, also was against such Pentecostal pursuits. She believed that in the Pentecostal movement there were many counterfeits from Satan and cases of demon possession. Andrew Murray was also a very spiritual man. He never spoke in tongues and did not encourage people to speak in tongues. The teaching that one cannot be saved without speaking in tongues or cannot receive the Holy Spirit without speaking in tongues is absolutely a satanic heresy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CASES OF COUNTERFEIT TONGUE-SPEAKING</h2>
<p>In 1963 I was invited by a Pentecostal group to lead a conference in San Diego for a week. When I arrived at the meeting place, I saw a sign advertising my name. Immediately, I asked them to take it down, or I could not speak. They took down the sign, and after speaking in the meeting, I stayed in the house of one of the leading ones, along with an American brother and two Chinese brothers and a sister. One night after the meeting was dismissed, we returned to his house, and I went to bed early. Then the host began to speak with the two Chinese brothers about tongues. He and his wife laid hands on them and told them to quickly and repeatedly say Hallelujah in order to speak in tongues. These two brothers were honest and could not pretend to speak in tongues. Nevertheless, the couple was so persistent that eventually one brother said to the other in Chinese that unless he babbled something, the couple would not let them go. The wife of one of the Chinese brothers was Indonesian, and so he uttered a few sentences in Indonesian. When the American couple heard this, they cheerfully applauded and proclaimed that he had spoken in tongues. The next morning the two brothers recounted how they were pressed to speak in tongues. When I heard this, I spoke to the brother who gave us hospitality, saying, &ldquo;Brother, why did you have to do this? Is the Lord Jesus not enough for you to preach? Is Christ not enough for you to supply? Why do you need to engage in such things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I was living near Los Angeles in 1963, a physics professor in his forties invited me to dinner in his home, and several others came with me. During dinner he testified how he was blessed to be able speak in tongues by just wagging his tongue and making sounds. As soon as he said this, I stopped him, saying, &ldquo;The Bible has no definite record that Peter and all the one hundred and twenty disciples spoke in tongues on the day of Pentecost. Furthermore, if the tongues they spoke at the time were just sounds made by wagging their tongues, then the tongues they spoke were not supernatural but merely manufactured. In the Old Testament Balaam&rsquo;s donkey spoke in a genuine human language. Tongue-speaking involves a supernatural power, that is, the power of the Holy Spirit coming upon you. There is no need to wag your tongue. If you need to wag your tongue, you are faking tongues.&rdquo; He had a doctorate in physics, and after hearing my analysis, he said nothing further.</p>
<p>Genuine tongue-speaking is produced by the Holy Spirit coming upon a person, but where is the power of the so-called tongue-speakers who make &ldquo;<em>di di da da</em>&rdquo; sounds today? Such ones also speak many prophecies, but none of them are ever fulfilled. A prophetess among some Pentecostals in Taiwan predicted that there would be a great revival throughout the whole world in 1966 and especially in Taiwan. Eventually, nothing happened. Some so-called Pentecostals on the West Coast of the United States repeatedly prophesied that there would be great earthquakes in Los Angeles and that the entire city would sink to the bottom of the sea. They even warned people to leave Los Angeles and live in mountain caves. These prophecies also were not fulfilled. When their prophecies did not come true, their movement declined on the West Coast.</p>
<p>Through our study, we discovered that their prophecies all had the same intonation, whether in Chinese, English, or any other language. There was even a so-called school for prophets on the West Coast that specialized in teaching people how to prophesy. Their prophecies were mainly extracted from the books of Isaiah and Jeremiah. Our study confirmed that this has been a great bothering to God&rsquo;s children. Over the past seven years, the churches among us in Southeast Asia and Taiwan have also been distracted very much by this movement. We need to issue a warning to God&rsquo;s people not to listen to these counterfeits from Satan.</p>
