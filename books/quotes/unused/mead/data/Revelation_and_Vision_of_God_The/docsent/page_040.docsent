   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE REALIZATION AND EXPERIENCE OF GOD'S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Matt 1:23, 21, 18; John 12:24; Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 1:4, 7, 13; 3:17-19; Rev 1:4-5; Matt 16:16, 18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have fellowshipped about two major points relating to the revelation and the vision of God: concerning the Divine Trinity and the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapter we saw four points concerning the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter I will speak particularly about our need for the subjective realization and experience of the Divine Trinity and of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After seeing the preceding four points, we will sense a need that we should not only study the so-called truths and visions, but we should also pay attention to the realization, knowledge, and experience of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, we should not just see the facts recorded in the Bible, but we should also realize and experience them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE REALIZATION, KNOWLEDGE, AND EXPERIENCE OF GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we really see the vision, we will certainly respond with an inner desire to realize, know, and experience God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can see from the very beginning of the New Testament, in Matthew chapter one, that the Triune God desires to dispense Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. The Lord Jesus as the Prototype of the Mingling of God and Man</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Matthew 1, we can see at least four facts: the genealogy of Jesus, the conception of Jesus, the birth of Jesus, and the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the most important thing concerning Matthew 1 is not just to see these facts but to see a precious vision in these facts and to make that vision our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must realize and experience these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Take for example these three words: the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you read them one by one separately, it is difficult to understand what they mean.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if you put them together and read them, then you can discover their meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By the same principle, in Matthew 1 several facts are presented here to speak forth a reality, and this reality is that the Triune God wants to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Vision in Matthew 1</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, we must see that Matthew 1 mentions God v. 23 ; it mentions the Son v. 21 , Jesus, who was God incarnated and born to be a man; it also mentions the Spirit v. 18 as the basic essence and element of the virgin Mary's pregnancy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, this chapter refers to Jehovah because Je in Jesus is a shortened form of Jehovah, and sus means Savior or salvation; furthermore, Jesus is the One who is called the Christ v. 18 . Thus, this one chapter mentions God, the Son, the Spirit, Jehovah, the Savior or salvation, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Anyone who studies the Bible can see these divine titles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we still need to see a vision here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Purpose of God's Creation of Man Being for Man to Have His Life</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Originally, God was outside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He created man in His image and according to His likeness, and then He breathed into man the breath of life, giving man life and breath.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God did not do these two things when He created the animals, or even when He created the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He created man in His own image and breathed His own breath, the breath of life, into man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was truly special that He did this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, God was still outside of man; He was He, and man was man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Despite this, these two were of the same kind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Genesis 1 when God created all the living things, everything was "according to their kind."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today those who graft trees know that trees of different species cannot be grafted together; only trees of the same species can be grafted.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In His creation, God did a work of preparation beforehand; that is, He created man to be of His kind with the view of having man enter into a relationship with Him just like the relationship of grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Later in the Bible the Lord Jesus Himself definitely told us that He is the true vine and we are the branches John 15:1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we must realize that we were not born as branches of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we were wild branches Rom 11:17, 24 , and it is by faith that we have been grafted into Him as the vine v. 20, cf. v. 23 . This means that although we and the Lord Jesus are different "trees," we are of the same species.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the very least, we have the same image as God and bear His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But despite the fact that we are of the same species with God, He is still He, and we are still we.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is outside of us, and we are outside of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In life and nature, and especially in essence, we and He are completely unrelated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please forgive me for saying that this point is the greatest deficiency in Christianity's theology.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is a school in Christianity called Reformed Theology.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who belong to this school absolutely deny that we saved ones have the divine nature inwardly; they mainly acknowledge that we have been reformed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They say that originally we were very evil, but now we have been reformed; similarly, society was once evil, but now it has been reformed and improved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the last century, this kind of teaching was very prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This group of people advocated that this world, instead of getting worse and worse, would become better and better.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the world would become a utopia even before the return of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A utopia is an ideal kingdom in which everyone is happy and everything is good.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Despite the fact that there is evil today, the day will come in which nothing is evil and everything becomes a utopia.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How can this happen?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First, it is by preaching the gospel to lead people to reform their errors and revert to good deeds through repentance; second, it is by teaching the biblical truths to exhort the believers to reform themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But since the biblical truths have not yet spread to the entire world, everyone must do their best to preach the gospel and bring people to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, this group of people pays no attention to regeneration; they only emphasize teaching the truth to change human society and turn it into a utopia, an ideal world.</S>
