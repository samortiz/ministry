   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONFIRMATION OF THE CHURCH GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The letter I wrote to Brother Hsieh Tien En was my first article published by Brother Nee s Gospel Book Room.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I labored very much in writing this article, and although it was a letter, it was like a booklet in content.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many points in the letter were concerning denominations; it defined a denomination and the meaning of denominationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the time I personally was not clear regarding the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I knew what oneness was and what a denomination was, and I could speak concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, I did not know the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The other co-workers were also unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only Brother Nee was clear.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>About one hundred twenty brothers and sisters from northern China attended the conference in January.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This special gathering was a turning point for the advance of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It also influenced me personally.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From the fellowship we saw the sin of sectarianism and the need for the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, some co-workers were burdened concerning this matter and determined to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the conference, I returned by boat to northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many brothers who attended the conference remained in Shanghai and requested that Brother Nee hold Bible-study meetings to help them know how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was because meetings were being raised up with ones who left the denominations and the sects, but they did not know how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Nee agreed, and the manuscripts were later edited and published as the book The Assembly Life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was not present during these meetings, having already returned to northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I returned to Shanghai four months later, I heard about the Bible study but did not see any notes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was only after Brother Nee finished editing the manuscript, that he gave it to me and asked me to write a preface.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I carefully read the messages and understood the content of the entire Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since then I have been deeply impressed that the expression of the church is local.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word expression, however, was not used then.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We began to use the word expression in 1950 in Taiwan when we defined the boundary of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was also about that time in 1934 that we began to fellowship concerning the matter of locality, and the light concerning locality was confirmed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the light concerning locality was confirmed, the ground of the church was also confirmed among us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During the January conference Brother Nee released clear messages on Christ as God s centrality, and he became very clear concerning the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result, 1934 was a milestone in the Lord s recovery, and we entered into another stage.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We saw that Christ as God s centrality and universality is the content of the church and that outwardly the church should take the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After this, Brother Nee was not the only one who was clear concerning all these matters; we, his co-workers, were also clear.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>BELIEVERS ENTHUSIASTICALLY LEAVING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE DENOMINATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By 1934 a number of people were leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was becoming a trend, and almost everywhere there was an enthusiastic response.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every day we received many letters and most of them were concerning leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the letters were given to me because I was the acting editor of Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From these letters we learned of many stories of ones who left the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We received letters from the northern, southern, and central parts of China.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Leaving the denominations even caused problems among the Western missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some of the missionaries from the China Inland Mission called a special meeting to discuss how to deal with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the eyes of Christianity, it was a revolution.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everywhere many were leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who left the denominations followed a general practice to leave openly, not secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In most cases, they would write and sign an official letter requesting their denomination to remove their names from the membership registry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was done rather officially.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although this was not a regulation, the general practice was to write an official letter declaring one s decision to leave the denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Believers were leaving with intense fervor and vigor.</S>
