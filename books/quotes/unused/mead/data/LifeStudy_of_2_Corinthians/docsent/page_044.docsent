   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LIVING PATTERN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My burden in this message is to point out that in the introductory word to 2 Corinthians Paul presents himself to the believers at Corinth as a pattern of a person who lives Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul seems to be saying, Corinthians, in my first Epistle I gave you a revelation of what it means to live Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now I know that you also need a pattern of such a living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In my second Epistle, I present myself to you as this living pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I ask you to look at me and see that I have no confidence in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My confidence is fully in the God of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because I have confidence in Him, I live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, whenever I decide something, I make a decision by taking Christ as my person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am one who is firmly attached to Christ, to God s Anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the Christ of the faithful God, the God with whom there is no shadow due to change.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, I, Paul, am one with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a person living Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul s purpose in living Christ was that God s administration may be carried out through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we want to know how to live Christ for the church, we need to consider the life of Paul and learn of him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is our pattern, our example.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among the Epistles written by Paul, 2 Corinthians is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This Epistle opens with Paul s personal testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This testimony is not given in a brief way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, it is presented in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul tells the Corinthians that he did not want them to be ignorant of the afflictions they experienced in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He wanted the believers at Corinth to know that the apostles were heavily pressed, that the pressure was so heavy that it was beyond their capacity to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They even despaired of life and had the sentence of death within themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to their feeling and realization, they were dying.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why did God put them into such a situation?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God did this because He wanted them to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, Paul could say, God s intention is to terminate us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He does not want us to live any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, He wants Christ to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>TERMINATED TO LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is easy to talk about termination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But for us to actually be terminated we need to experience a great deal of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, the Lord will use your husband or wife and your children to terminate you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are a wife, the Lord will use your husband to terminate you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you are a husband, the Lord will use your wife to cut you to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, your children will also be helpful to Him in bringing you to an end so that Christ may live in you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is easy to say in a doctrinal way that we have been crucified with Christ, that we no longer live, and that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This may be nothing more than a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is possible to go on speaking like this for years, quoting Galatians 2:20 again and again, but still not live Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all need to experience the inward cutting in a practical way so that we may be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord will even use the saints in the church life to accomplish this for us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a sense, the church life is a life of slaughter, a life of termination.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Praise the Lord that we are willing to be slaughtered because our desire is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we live Christ, our confidence will be in the God of resurrection, in the God who raises the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we shall conduct ourselves in the grace of God, and we shall be one with the unchanging Christ of the faithful God, the Christ who is the unique yes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thank the Lord that in all these verses in 2 Corinthians 1 we see that Paul was a pattern of living Christ for the church.</S>
