<h2 class="head2">Having Fellowship with the Lord</h2>
<p>How can we bear responsibility in a meeting? How can we exercise our spirit in a meeting? To bear responsibility in a meeting, we must first prepare our spirit and have fellowship with the Lord. If we do not have fellowship with the Lord before coming to a meeting, our spirit will be deadened and lack vitality. If this is the case, it will be difficult for us to bear the burden in a meeting. To bear the burden in a meeting, we must have personal fellowship with the Lord for our spirit to be uplifted.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Fully Open to the Lord and to the Meeting</h2>
<p>Second, when we come to a meeting, we must learn to fully open ourselves to the Lord and to the meeting. This affords the Holy Spirit the opportunity to use us and to touch us. This also enables us to sense the atmosphere and flavor of the meeting so that we know which hymn to select and how to pray. Therefore, we must be open in the meetings and be ready to receive the burden from the Holy Spirit. Many brothers and sisters do not prepare themselves before a meeting. They do not remember that there is a meeting until ten minutes before the meeting begins. Then they hurriedly rush to the meeting without bearing any burden for the meeting and their spirit is still closed. Then at the meeting only a few brothers will take care of the meeting to select hymns and pray; they are like priests for the church who minister on behalf of the saints. Although this is not prearranged, every attendant knows that someone will select a hymn and someone will pray; everyone else can simply sit, watch, and do nothing because a few brothers will bear the full responsibility. Since a few brothers will take the lead to select a hymn and to pray, the rest of the saints can relax and enjoy. We should never be like this. Prior to any meeting we should open our spirit. After we sit down in the meeting, we should seek the Lord as to what He desires us to do. We must touch the feeling of the Holy Spirit and receive inspiration from Him. If we are open in this way, the Holy Spirit will surely move us to receive the burden.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Touching the Atmosphere of the Meeting</h2>
<p>Third, upon entering a meeting we must learn to touch the atmosphere, the spirit, of the meeting. Suppose a brother was taken by the Lord, and the saints are holding a memorial meeting in his home. When we enter the house, we can sense a sorrowful atmosphere; we can touch a sorrowful spirit. It would be inappropriate for us to laugh and select any hymn we please. Conversely, if we are in a wedding meeting, where the atmosphere is joyful, it would be unfitting for us to ignore the atmosphere, the spirit, of the meeting and select a hymn that asks for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>When we come into a meeting, we should be prepared in spirit, our entire being should be open to the Lord and to the meeting, and we should exercise our spirit to touch the atmosphere of the meeting. Then we will be a channel for the Holy Spirit, and He will be able to use us as a channel to bear responsibility for the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A TWOFOLD KNOWLEDGE NEEDED<br />
FOR SELECTING HYMNS</h2>
<p>Concerning the selection of hymns, we need a twofold knowledge. First, we need to know the hymns in their categories; second, we need to know the progression of singing in a meeting. According to categories, there are hymns on preaching the gospel, prayer, spiritual pursuit, spiritual edification, spiritual warfare, praise, bread breaking, and worship. We must be familiar with all the categories. Otherwise, we may touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence and sense His glory yet select a hymn on rising up to preach the gospel. This would not be fitting, and it would not be proper. For this reason, we must spend time to study our hymns.</p>
<p>We must also know the progression of singing in a meeting. In a table meeting, the first hymn is a beginning hymn, which should be longer in order to calm the saints&rsquo; hearts and bring the saints to the Lord. Because a meeting has a beginning section, there are beginning hymns.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROGRESSION OF A MEETING</h2>
<p>There are roughly ten steps in the progression of a meeting. The first step is the opening, and the second is the introduction which brings the meeting to its subject. After an opening hymn is sung and a strong prayer is offered, the second hymn should bring the meeting to its subject. After the saints sing the introductory hymn, there should be some introductory prayers concerning the subject. The third step is the strengthening. If the meeting is still not strong after singing and prayers related to the first and second steps, there will be a need to call another hymn, a strengthening hymn. If the spirit is still not strong enough after singing the strengthening hymn and offering some strong prayers, there will be a need for the fourth step, which is the stirring up of the spirit. Sometimes the third and fourth steps transpire simultaneously.</p>
<p>The fifth step is the turning. For example, after the remembrance of the Lord, we need to turn to worship the Father. Sometimes the Lord&rsquo;s table has not reached the point of worshipping the Father, but a brother selects <em>Hymns,</em> #33; sometimes a brother selects <em>Hymns,</em> #101 immediately after the bread and the cup have been passed. Both are inappropriate. Hence, there is the need of a sixth step for correction. Sometimes a meeting may be quite long. For example, when a great number of saints gather together, it may take a longer time for the bread and the cup to be passed. If this is the case, there may be the need to maintain the spirit through a hymn or some prayers. This is the seventh step, maintaining the spirit for the meeting. Even though we use hymns and prayers to maintain the spirit, there may still be the need to fill up the time with more prayers and singing. This is the eighth step. Then toward the end of the meeting comes the ninth step to sing a concluding hymn. Sometimes even though the meeting has ended, there is still a lingering air; thus, we may select another hymn to send the saints off. This is the tenth step. This can be compared to sending off a friend who has visited you by walking a distance with him.</p>
<p>We often have the sense at the end of the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting that everyone wishes the meeting could continue. At such a time, without waiting for the brothers to call a hymn, everyone may spontaneously begin to sing, &ldquo;Glory, honor, praise and power, / Be unto the Lamb forever! / Jesus Christ is our Redeemer, / Hallelujah! Hallelujah! / Hallelujah! Praise ye the Lord!&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #240). In this way, everyone leaves singing. This is an example of sending people off.</p>
<p>Just as there are ten steps for singing, there are also ten steps for prayer. Ideally, one hymn should be accompanied by one or two prayers. For example, after the first hymn, a prayer should follow. After the second hymn, one or two prayers should follow. After a strengthening hymn, one or two prayers should be added. If a spirit-stirring hymn is called, it should be accompanied by a prayer that uplifts the spirit; in this way, everyone&rsquo;s spirit will be uplifted. In this case, there will be no need for turning, correcting, or maintaining the spirit. If there is still time, we can have more prayer and sing another hymn. This would be wonderful!</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMING TO THE MEETING<br />
TO FUNCTION IN THE MEETING</h2>
<p>If we meet in this way, the brothers and sisters will enjoy coming to the meetings, because they will be inwardly touched by God and will testify that God is indeed among us in our meetings. However, if we do not know how to meet when we come together, when the Holy Spirit touches a brother, he will not move. Then the Holy Spirit will find another brother, who will also ignore Him. The Holy Spirit will then come to yet another brother, who also may not think that the meeting is his responsibility. Thus, the Holy Spirit will not be able to find a channel, and the meeting will be poor. As a result, some may then even take the opportunity to speak many strange things.</p>
<p>For example, a brother may begin with praises and thanksgiving, but because no one follows, another will stand up and speak something strange. If no one is willing to stop the strange speaking, he will continue; however, if the saints had followed the spirit to pray, the strange speaking would never have been released. If the brothers and sisters are not willing to bear the responsibility and no one is willing to pray, all kinds of strange speaking will find a way to come out in the meeting. We should not blame those who speak strange things. Rather, we should blame ourselves for not bearing the responsibility. If such a situation continues, many brothers and sisters may find it unbearable and stop coming to the meeting. Therefore, we must all bear responsibility in the meetings and allow the Holy Spirit to use us as channels. This is a great matter, for which we need to be cautious and pray much.</p>
<p>We must take the meetings seriously and not conduct ourselves according to our mood and excitement. We all need to realize that we come to a meeting to fulfill our priestly ministry, to function; we do not come to take care of our mood and excitement. If we start work at eight, we should be at our place of work exactly at eight. Likewise, whenever we come to the meeting, we must mean business. We need to diligently exercise our spirit. We should exercise our spirit when we are happy and when we are unhappy. We need to take the meeting as our responsibility. When we come to the meeting, we should function in the meeting and bear the burden of the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING IN THE TABLE MEETING</h2>
<p>There are a few points that require our attention regarding our prayer in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. First, our prayer must be related to the preceding hymn. Second, our prayer must go further and higher. It should not be lower or even parallel to the preceding one. Third, we must pay attention to the feeling of the meeting and press forward with the spirit of the meeting. Fourth, we should use utterances with poetic qualities; do not be dull or crude. Fifth, our prayer should bring the meeting to its subject. Sixth, we should avoid ritualistic formalities and instead seek to use words of revelation. When we pray in the table meeting, we must firmly grasp these six points.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
