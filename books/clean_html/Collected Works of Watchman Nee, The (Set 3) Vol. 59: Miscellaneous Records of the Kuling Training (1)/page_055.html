<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />SUBMISSION AND SPEAKING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: June 24, 1948<br />Place: Kuling Mountain<br />Scripture Reading: 2 Pet. 2:10-12</h1><h2 class="head1">SUBMISSION BEING THE VERY NATURE<br />OF THE SONS OF GOD</h2><p>Yesterday we spoke of God's desire to manifest His authority in the church. Those who are in the church should submit to authority. The Bible has a few words to say concerning the Christian pathway. Romans 10:16 says that a man is saved through obeying the gospel. This means that the gospel is a command. Romans 10:16, 1 Peter 4:17, and 2 Thessalonians 1:8 all speak of obeying the gospel. Romans 2:8 and 1 Peter 1:22 speak of obeying the truth (which is God's word). God's gospel is a command, and God's truth is also a command. This is the reason the Bible says that we should obey both the gospel and the truth. Obeying carries a more positive sense than submitting. First Peter 3:1 speaks of those who disobey the word. Hebrews 5:9 says that Christ became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation. In other words, God saves those who obey Him. Acts 5:32 says that God has given the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him. Therefore, obedience is a characteristic of a Christian. The name Christian implies those who obey. It is better to call a believer an "obeyer." A Christian is an "obeyer" because this is the virtue, characteristic, and nature of God's children. God can only get what He wants from the church because outside the realm of the church everything is in rebellion against God. If we do not express God's authority in the church, we have given up His very own nature.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH CANNOT FAIL</h2><p>The church as God's chosen vessel is the last "obeyer." For this reason we should not be defeated in the church. We cannot be allowed or permitted to be defeated. God chose the angels, but they failed. He chose the Israelites, but they failed as well. The church cannot fail again. Fukien natives try to make new vessels out of spoiled ones. God's final work, however, is with the church. If the church fails, God cannot have any more work. We have no choice but to obey. We cannot rebel, because God has no further work. God sent Moses, David, and the prophets to the world. Finally Christ came. In God's economy the church is God's final work. You may be obedient or rebellious. God, however, must gain His vessel&mdash;the church. You must have the realization that the church has only one way to go&mdash;to overcome; it cannot fail. It has to be holy and without blemish, free from spots or wrinkles, as described in Ephesians 5. The Lord is building the church upon the rock, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it (Matt. 16:18). The church has no other choice but to overcome. The Lord will perfect the church. It cannot fail God again.</p><p>Some time ago someone asked, "What would happen if we failed again?" We should not ask such a question. We have to overcome. We should not ask, "What would happen if the Lord failed?" The Lord cannot fail; He must overcome. Similarly, we should not ask, "What would happen if we failed?" Such a thought should never enter the mind of the church. We should be nothing but absolute. We must overcome. Just as it was unthinkable for the Lord to sin, it should be unthinkable for the church to fail.</p><p>Josephus was a Jewish historian. He did not believe in Christ. According to his history, demon possession was running rampant when Christ was walking on earth. It seems as if the entire army of Hades rose up against Him. In the end, however, the Lord overcame them all. Therefore, the church must take the way of submission. The destiny of the church is victory. Whether or not we want to submit, we have to submit. God is God, and He never changes. His throne remains forever. The church cannot turn back. Our way today is to be the "obeyer." This is a tremendous way. Who can frustrate God's way? Who are you? Can you frustrate God's will?</p><p>Sometimes I laugh to myself, saying, "How can a tiny, rebellious, and defiant worldling withstand God's way?" The Lord only needs to move His little finger slightly and everything will be cleared up. Only an omnipotent one can say that he does not need to submit to anyone. We are not qualified to say such a word. As soon as we appear before God, before His plan, and before His word, we have to bow down.</p>
