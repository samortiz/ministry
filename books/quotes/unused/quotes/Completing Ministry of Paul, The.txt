When we turn from these other things in which we were raised and educated, we are left with only this all-inclusive Spirit
The renewing of the mind indicates that transformation is in the soul, because the mind is the leading part of the soul
When this new element replacing the old is added to our soul, there will be a change in our mind, emotion, and will

To have the church as the Body of Christ, as Ephesians 1 tells us, involves Christ's resurrection, His ascension, and His headship
