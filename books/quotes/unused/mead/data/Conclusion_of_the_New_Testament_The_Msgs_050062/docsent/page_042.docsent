   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Opener of the New Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Revelation 5 we see that, in the divine administration, Christ is the Opener of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The scroll in this chapter must be the new covenant enacted with the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The new covenant is a scroll covering the redemption of the church, Israel, the earth, and the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the sealed scroll is the secrecy of God's administration in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the new covenant was enacted by the death of Christ, it has been a mystery to mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now, after His resurrection and ascension, Christ is the Opener of the scroll of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apart from Christ, no one is worthy to open the scroll of the new covenant Rev 5:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John "wept much because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it" v. 4 . Then John heard these words: "Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals" v. 5 . Christ is the fighting, victorious, and overcoming Lion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the Lion of the tribe of Judah, He has overcome Satan, the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has solved this problem for God and has removed the hindrances to the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His overcoming qualifies Him to open the scroll and its seven seals.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, He is worthy to open the scrolls concerning God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although John was told to behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah, verse 6 says that, "I saw in the midst of the throne a Lamb standing as having been slain."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The angel recommended Christ as the Lion, but John saw Him as the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the Lion, Christ is the Fighter against the enemy; as the Lamb, He is the Redeemer for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's purpose needs someone to carry it out who can solve all the problems of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The problems that God had were the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the Lion, Christ has defeated the rebellious Satan, and as the Lamb, He has taken away the sin of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because Christ has solved these two problems for God, He is worthy to open the scroll of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Shepherd of God's Redeemed</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Revelation 7:9-17 is a record of Christ with God's redeemed in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 9 speaks of "a great multitude which no one could number, out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches in their hands."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are the redeemed ones, throughout all generations from the nations, who constitute the church Rev 5:9; Rom 11:25; Acts 15:14, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They have been purchased with the blood of the Lamb, and their white robes indicate that their conduct is pure and approved by God through the washing of the blood of the Lamb v. 14 . In the divine administration Christ is the Shepherd of the redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In eternity we shall not have problems, but we shall still need Christ's shepherding, especially His feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Under the shepherding of Christ, we shall not want Psa 23:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 7:16 and 17 say, "They shall not hunger any more, neither shall they thirst any more, neither shall the sun beat upon them, nor any heat; for the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them and shall guide them to springs of waters of life; and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here we see that the Lamb will shepherd God's redeemed and guide them to springs of waters of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As our Shepherd Christ will lead us into Himself as the spring of water of life so that we may enjoy the eternal dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In eternity we shall drink of many springs and enjoy many different waters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, under Christ's shepherding our tears will be wiped away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Tears are a sign of dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Waters of life are for satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because the Lamb will supply God's redeemed with waters of life for their satisfaction, they will have no tears of dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The waters of life will be supplied, and the water of tears will be wiped away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Under Christ's shepherding in eternity there will be no tears, hunger, or thirst just enjoyment.</S>
