   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EFFECTS OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This indwelling sin is the cause of death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Wherever sin is, there death is also.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The death described in Romans 5 through 8 is not mainly the death that causes people to die physically, but the death that kills them today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This death is doing a deadening work upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reason so many are weak in prayer and low in functioning in the meetings is the working of death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some brothers and sisters are not one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This lack of oneness comes from death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you cannot open your mouth to testify in a living way, it is because of the deadening, the working, of death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you were not under death, you would be bubbling, praying, praising, functioning, and testifying all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, you would be one with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as you are not like this, you are dead, even though you may be good, right, and scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we have pointed out, Romans 8:6 says that the mind set on the flesh is death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The kind of death here is not that which causes people to die physically and to be buried; it is the death that deadens them all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In doing many things, you may be full of energy, but in praying you are low and lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that the death in your body has spread its influence and deadening power into your mind and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once while Brother Nee was speaking, he asked the sisters to tell him how many chapters there are in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They had difficulty giving the correct number.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Immediately Brother Nee said, You cannot tell me how many chapters there are in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if I ask you how many long gowns you have, you are able to give me the exact number.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only can you tell me the number, but also the color and the style.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many Christians find it difficult to remember verses in the Bible, but they can easily remember so many details about their possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that their minds have been deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the mind has been deadened, it is good for fleshly and worldly things, but not for spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to allow the indwelling Christ to spread from our spirit to all the inward parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should pray, Lord Jesus, I will let You spread in me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I want You to have a free course within me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do this, your mind will become sober and your memory keen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Spontaneously it will be easy for you to remember verses in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Death is working in an inward direction from our body to our spirit, but life works in an outward direction from our spirit to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The direction of death s work is from the circumference to the center, whereas the direction of life s work is from the center to the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, death and life work in opposite directions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As death works from the circumference to the center, it deadens our mind and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE WAY TO BE FREED FROM DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have seen how to be freed from sin, from the law, and from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we must find out how to be freed from death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Death s base in us is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The only way to escape from death and to be freed from it is to take refuge in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our flesh is the base of death, and our spirit is our refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to flee into this refuge and escape from death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Death is versus life, and life is versus death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Death is in our flesh, and life is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nothing can chase death away or swallow it up, just as nothing can drive darkness away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, when light comes, darkness vanishes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no need to expend effort to drive darkness away or to command it to disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Simply allow the light to come in. The more the light comes in, the more the darkness disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The same principle applies to the matter of life versus death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By our effort we cannot drive death away or swallow it up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only life can swallow death, and life is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever life comes in, death vanishes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Death is Satan and life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not let yourself be associated with Satan in the flesh, but always stay in your spirit with Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then you will see that Christ, who is your life, will have a free course within you to spread into every part of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually, He will saturate every part of you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the enlivening, the quickening, of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Life will enliven your mind, emotion, and will and even be imparted into your mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, every part of your being will be life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The spirit is life, the mind will be life, and the body also will be life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When this happens, death, the last enemy, will be swallowed up.</S>
