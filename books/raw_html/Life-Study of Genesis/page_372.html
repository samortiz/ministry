<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(c) Following the Spirit</H2><P>After receiving and enjoying all these riches, Rebekah followed the servant, traveling through the desert on a camel until she met Isaac (vv. 58, 61-65). Likewise, we are following the Spirit, traveling a long journey on a "camel." When we meet Christ, we shall dismount from our "camel." All the modern conveniences, such as telephones, automobiles, etc., are our "camels" today. Rebekah traveled through the desert on top of a camel, and we are traveling through the desert on today's modern "camels." According to Leviticus 11, a camel is unclean; yet it is useful. Many of today's conveniences are not clean in the eyes of God. Nevertheless, they enable us to travel through the desert. When we meet Him, we shall leave the "camels."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(4) The Son's Marriage</H2><P>In a good sense, the son, Isaac, did nothing. This indicates that everything is planned by the Father and carried out by the Spirit. All the Son does is receive the bride.</P><P>Isaac received Rebekah at eventide (vv. 63-64). This implies that the marriage of Christ will be at the eventide of the age. At the close of this age, Christ will come to meet His bride.</P><P>Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah's tent and loved her (v. 67). As we have seen, Sarah typifies grace. Hence, this means that Christ will meet us in grace as well as in love.</P><P>This chapter ends with the words, "Isaac was comforted after his mother's death." If I had been the writer, I would have said that Rebekah was comforted after her long journey. But the Bible does not say this. Do not consider your comfort, your satisfaction; rather, consider Christ's comfort, Christ's satisfaction. If Christ has no comfort and satisfaction, we cannot have any comfort and satisfaction either. Our satisfaction depends on His. Our comfort is His comfort, and His satisfaction is ours. Christ is now waiting for His comfort. When will He have it? On the day of His marriage. That day will come.</P>
