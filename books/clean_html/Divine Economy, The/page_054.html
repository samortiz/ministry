In the four Gospels is the Son with the Father by the Spirit. In the twenty-two books from Acts through Jude is the Spirit as the Son with the Father. This Spirit is the all-inclusive, compound, processed, life-giving Spirit. In the book of Revelation the all-inclusive, compound, processed, life-giving Spirit is now intensified seven times. He is the sevenfold intensified Spirit. The life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God is seven times intensified. In John 20:22 is the Spirit as the breath, the essential Spirit. In Acts 2 and 10 is the economical Spirit. In 1 Corinthians 12 is the manifestation of the Spirit. Finally, in Revelation is the life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, seven times intensified. The seven Spirits are the seven lamps of the lampstand (Rev. 4:5) and the seven eyes of the Lamb (Rev. 5:6).</P><P>Essentially, the Spirit is only one, but economically, He is seven. In God's economy and in His function, He becomes the sevenfold intensified Spirit. In Revelation it is not a matter of the essence but a matter of the function, of the economy. Economically speaking, the Spirit is intensified sevenfold. In substance and existence God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation, God's Spirit is sevenfold.</P><P>Economically speaking, the Spirit of God in God's administration is the eyes of the administrating Son, the seven Spirits. This is for function, not for existence. In order for us to do anything we need our eyes. In the divine administration, Christ needs the Spirit to be His eyes. Without the seven Spirits, Christ does not have the eyes. Christ is the very focal Executor of God's economy, yet He needs the seven Spirits as His eyes to carry out God's economy.</P><P>The Nicene Creed, which was formulated in A.D. 325, is not complete because it does not say anything concerning the seven Spirits. This creed talks about the Godhead of the Triune God, the divine Trinity, in a general way, but it does not cover anything in Revelation. When the Nicene Creed was made in A.D. 325, there was still disagreement as to whether Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and Revelation should be included in the Bible or not. Thus, this creed was made apart from the truth contained in the book of Revelation. It was not until A.D. 397 at the council held in Carthage in the northern part of Africa that Revelation, along with the other six books, was recognized as a part of the New Testament. The Nicene Creed is not complete because it does not cover the book of Revelation, which is the ultimate consummation of the divine revelation.</P>
