   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>GOD S ROMANCE WITH MAN A. Creating Man with the Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>of Having a Counterpart</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Throughout the centuries, God has had a romance with man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God created man with the purpose of having a counterpart Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His intention in creating man was not mainly to have servants.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we read the Bible in a pure way, without any preoccupations, we shall realize that God s purpose in creating man was to gain a counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is not a fighter; He is a lover.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He created man in the image of Himself as a lover.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that He created man so that man would love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In eternity God was alone; we may even say that He was lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His desire for love could not be fulfilled by angels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, God created man according to His own being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is loving, and He wants man to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way there will be a mutual relationship of love between God and mankind, those created to be His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. Choosing Israel to Be His Spouse</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Old Testament indicates clearly that God came in to choose Israel to be His spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Jeremiah 31:3 the Lord says, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When God appeared to His people, He dated them and later even courted them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to Ezekiel 16, God loved Israel when He saw her in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 8 describes this love: Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By entering into a covenant with Israel, God betrothed her to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jeremiah 2:2 also speaks of this covenant, this engagement: I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy betrothals, how thou followedst after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This verse indicates that the covenant was enacted in the wilderness after God had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapters one through nineteen of Exodus were the time of Israel s youth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord remembered the kindness of Israel s youth and the love of her betrothals.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have wondered how much Israel actually loved God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps in this verse the Lord was comforting Himself as does a young man who tries to encourage himself when the one he loves fails to respond to his wooing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a young man might be encouraged if the one he loves even looks at him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Where in the first nineteen chapters of Exodus do we see the love of Israel s betrothals to God?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where do we find such an espousing love?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although it is difficult for us to find, Jeremiah 2:2 nonetheless tells us that the Lord remembers the love of Israel s betrothals and the kindness of her youth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It seems to me that Israel was not so kind, polite, or courteous to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet Jeremiah tells us that He remembered the kindness of Israel s youth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The expressions used in Jeremiah 2:2 reveal how much God loved the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In a sense, we might say that God was blinded by His love for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After creating man, He chose a people, the children of Israel, to be His spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>C. Coming to Be the Bridegroom for the Bride</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord Jesus came, He came as the Bridegroom for the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many Christians are familiar with John the Baptist s declaration: Behold, the Lamb of God John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, not so many realize that John also referred to the Lord Jesus as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In John 3:29 he says, He who has the bride is the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This word is included in a chapter on regeneration John 3:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The goal of regeneration is to produce and prepare the bride for the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since Christ is the One who will have the bride, He is the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As God incarnate, Christ came not only to be our Redeemer and Savior; He also came to be our Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Matthew 9:15 the Lord Jesus referred to Himself as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To the blind religionists who were asking Him about fasting, the Lord said, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In dealing with the question raised by the disciples of John, the Lord revealed Himself as the Bridegroom coming to receive the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In their blindness, the religionists could not see that Christ was the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is crucial that our eyes be opened to see the Lord as our Bridegroom.</S>
