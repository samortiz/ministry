   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT ONLY COEXISTING, BUT ALSO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>COINHERING WITH THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ the Son not only coexists, but also coinheres with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Gospel of John we are told that in eternity past the Son and the Father coexisted, because the Word was with God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Son came, He said that He was not alone, that the Father was with Him John 8:16, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So while He was on earth, He and the Father were existing together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But on the other hand, the Lord said that He was in the Father, and the Father was in Him John 14:10a, 11a; 17:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some have said that the Son and the Father are separate, and that the Son just represents the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the Lord said if you have seen Me, you have seen the Father John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not a matter of representation; this is a matter of embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Father is totally embodied in the Son Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you see the Son, you see the Father, because the Son is the embodiment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You cannot separate them because the First is embodied in the Second, and the Second is the very embodiment of the First.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So the Second is in the First, and the First is in the Second.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not for doctrine, but for experience on our side and for dispensing on His side.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we called on the Lord and were saved, right away we had the realization that Someone had come into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Who was that?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Was it the Father, or the Son, or the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is hard to say.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, it seems the Son is in us; later it seems the Father is also in us; eventually it seems the Spirit is in us as well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as we have the Spirit, we also have the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we have one, we have three, because the Three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the dispensing of the Triune God, and this is for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Triune God has been dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This very Triune God now has to be our very living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to forget about so many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our life and our living should not be religion or ethics, but the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must live the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today this Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is within us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christians today may talk about the Trinity, but after talking, they forget about it and live in their own name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They don t live in the name they talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must live in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, and in the name of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not live in our own name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as we live in the name of the Triune God, our living will be marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It will be holy and righteous and even divine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is much more than being religious or ethical.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is living the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For to me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 , not religion, not ethics, and not even the so-called Pentecostal power.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some Christians claim to have the Pentecostal power, but Paul claimed to have the One who empowered him Phil 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our Christian life should not be religion or ethics or power, but the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It should be no more I, but Christ lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some of the brothers in this country have listened to me since 1963.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They can testify that I have never changed my tune, because this is the unique thing that the Lord is going to recover today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And this is the unique thing that we need as Christians who love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to see such a vision that in God s economy He doesn t want something else; He only wants to work Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ the Son coexists and coinheres with the Father so that He with the Father might be dispensed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>ONE WITH THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the Son and the Father are coinhering, they are one John 10:30; 17:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Son is one with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a mystery which I cannot explain.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are just one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because they are one, when you see the First, you see the Second.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>LIVING BECAUSE OF THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In John 6:57, Christ the Son said that He lived because of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The King James Version reads that He lived through the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These are two different translations of the Greek preposition dia.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But according to the grammatical structure, it should read because of, not through.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is more meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Son lived on earth not just by the Father or through the Father, but because of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His living had a cause.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That cause was the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Father was the cause of the Son s living on earth; the Father was not just an instrument through or by which the Son lived.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today this very Son should be the cause of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should live not only by Him and through Him, but because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He should be the cause of our living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Otherwise, our living would be meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Without the Father as His cause, the Son s living on earth for thirty-three and a half years would have been altogether vain.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But it was not in vain, because the Son s living had a cause, and this cause was the Father.</S>
