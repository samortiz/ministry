   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE ABRAHAM AND THE LAND OF CANAAN Scripture Reading: Acts 7:2; Gen 12:4 13:18; 14:11-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abraham's history can be divided into three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 12 through 14 form the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The emphasis in this section is the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapters fifteen through twenty-two form the second section.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The emphasis in this section is his son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapters twenty-three to twenty-five form the third section.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It covers the events which happened in Abraham's old age.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us first come to the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 12:4-5 says, "So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After Abraham heard God's second calling in Haran, he left Haran and came to Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we have to realize that it is possible for a person to reach Canaan without knowing why he is there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not think that once we see the vision, everything will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is one thing to see the heavenly vision, but it is another thing to not disobey the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After Abraham arrived in Canaan, verse 7 says, "And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the second time God appeared to Abraham and the third time He spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God appeared and spoke once more so that Abraham would have a clear and fresh impression of the things God had committed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is easy for us to lose the vision of God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even if we are consciously trying to be a proper Christian, it is still possible for us to lose our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can lose our vision even while we are working diligently day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not think that only mundane things can blur our vision; even spiritual things can blur our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not live continuously in God's appearing, it will be easy for us to lose the vision of our calling.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The calling that the church has received is the same as the calling that Abraham received.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But many people have not seen the hope of this calling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, Paul prayed, "That you may know what is the hope of His calling" Eph 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Hope" indicates the content of this calling, the things included in God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May God deliver us from selfish thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We know that God calls us with a definite goal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our salvation is to fulfill this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have not seen the substance of Abraham's calling, we will not see the meaning of our own calling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have not seen the key to Abraham's calling, we will not see our own ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not see this, we will be like those who build a house without a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How easy it is for us to forget what God wants to do!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many times, when we have too much to do and the work becomes a little more hectic, we lose sight of our spiritual calling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to come again and again to the Lord and beseech Him: "Appear to me again and again, and speak to me again and again!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to have a continuous seeing, an eternal seeing; we need to see God's goal and what God is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Abraham had reached Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After he arrived in Canaan, several things happened.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, he built three altars in Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second, he was tested three times in Canaan.</S>
