        <h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S FURTHER RECOVERY</h2>
<p>In the past thirty years it seems that we have not cared for any other matter. At the time of Martin Luther it seemed that he did not care about any matter other than justification by faith, although we know that this is not true and that he did care about other matters. However, the reason people have an inaccurate impression is that Martin Luther emphasized the main point that God was recovering through him. Perhaps he could have discarded all the other points, but God would not let him discard this one point. We deeply sense that God has recovered many things and that He is now recovering the ground of the church. He wants to show us the importance of the ground of the church. We cannot and dare not believe that it is erroneous to say that God wants us to focus on this matter. We believe that the ground of the church is God&rsquo;s further recovery today.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is continually advancing. Through Robert Pearsall Smith the Lord recovered the matter of consecration unto holiness. Following this, through Andrew Murray the Lord recovered the matter of fellowshipping by abiding in Him. Then through Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis He recovered the matter of identification with Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. Through T. Austin-Sparks the Lord continued and recovered the truth concerning His resurrection. He did not stop at the recovery of the truth concerning resurrection; rather, He advanced to recover the ground of the church. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is according to His purpose for the accomplishing of His economy. Justification by faith, revival, consecration, fellowship by abiding in Christ, and identification with Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection are gold, silver, and precious stones. Where should these valuable things be placed? Should they be in Babylon or in Jerusalem? The Lord has recovered the ground of the church in order to uphold the items of gold, silver, and precious stone.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s recovery is wonderful. We believe that God does all things well. The order, the sequence, of the Lord&rsquo;s work of creation is wonderful, and we believe that the order of His work of recovery is also wonderful.</p>
<p>The history of the recovery shows that God first recovered justification by faith. Then He recovered the matter of consecration. After a person is consecrated, there is the need to have fellowship with the Lord and to know the indwelling Christ. The next item is a believer&rsquo;s identification with the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection. Then in resurrection the Body of Christ is produced. This Body needs to have a practical expression, an actual appearance, on earth. Where should this expression be? In other words, where should the gold, silver, and precious stones be placed? We cannot say that the gold, silver, and precious stones are the site; they are the building materials. On the day of Pentecost, God established the ground of locality. For example, Jerusalem is a city, and it was the ground of the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1; 11:22). Moreover, the many cities in Galatia became the ground for the churches in Galatia (Gal. 1:2). One who sees this light should immediately return to the ground ordained by God. God has already presented the ground of locality in the Bible. There is no need for us to look for the ground; we just need to return to it.</p>
<p>The children of Israel built the temple on the site that God designated, but the temple was destroyed by the enemy. The children of Israel were taken captive to various places, and the materials for the temple&mdash;the gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;were lost. Later some of the children of Israel who were in captivity returned to Jerusalem; similarly, we should return to the ground of the church. Beginning with the recovery of justification by faith through Luther, there has been the recovery of consecration, fellowship by abiding in Christ, and identification with Christ&rsquo;s cross and resurrection. Figuratively speaking, these are the gold, silver, and precious stones that have been recovered for the rebuilding of the temple of God, but where can the temple be built? Will it be built abstractly in the universe? No, it is built practically in various localities. God needs to recover the ground of locality because it has been lost.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROUND OF LOCALITY</h2>
<p>The return of the children of Israel to Jerusalem typifies the return of God&rsquo;s people to the proper ground of locality. The children of Israel in captivity had to return to Jerusalem. It was wrong for them to stay in Babylon. After they left Babylon, however, it was also improper for them to linger halfway and not fully return to Jerusalem. Similarly, God wants His people to leave the ground of organized Christianity&mdash;Babylon&mdash;and return to the ground of locality&mdash;Jerusalem. Leaving organized Christianity without returning to the ground of locality does not match up to God&rsquo;s intention. This is to linger on the ground of a &ldquo;halfway shelter.&rdquo; God rejects the ground of Babylon and any other ground that does not match the ground of Jerusalem. God rejects not only the ground of organized Christianity but also the ground of a &ldquo;halfway shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many groups have left organized Christianity but have not returned to the ground of locality. Hence, their ground is still wrong and rejected by God. Only one ground is right and accepted by God&mdash;the ground of locality. Only one ground is right&mdash;Jerusalem. The grounds of Babylon, Assyria, and even neighboring Samaria were not right. Likewise, the grounds of the Catholic Church and all the denominations are not right. All grounds other than the local ground are not right.</p>
<p>The matter of the ground is serious. If the children of Israel had built a temple in Babylon with the same materials that they used to build the temple in Jerusalem, they would have been completely wrong. Such a mistake would have been due not to the materials or the work but to the ground. This clearly proves that besides the matter of spirituality, there is still the matter of the ground. Both the ground and spirituality are necessary and indispensable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GREAT RESTRICTION</h2>
<p>When I began to serve the Lord over thirty years ago, I had doubts concerning Christianity. I saw in the Bible that the condition of Christianity was altogether improper. I also saw that the ground of Christianity was improper. The improper condition is an outward matter, but the improper ground is a deeper matter. Actually, it is the source of almost every problem in Christianity. The confusion and errors of Christianity are mostly due to the improper ground. For example, the church has become very worldly and very much according to the human will. Although this is a matter of condition, the condition is the result of an improper ground. The proper ground of the church is locality. If the believers all kept the ground of locality, the many denominations that exist today would no longer exist or be produced. The ground of locality requires that the believers pay the highest price, the price of being dealt with in their flesh and in their natural life.</p>
<p>Today there are many Christian groups because people are not willing to be restricted by locality. Many groups have appealing names, but these are only an expression of man&rsquo;s desire. It may seem that these groups are only declaring that they love the Lord, are zealous for the Lord, preach the gospel, and are accomplishing a certain work. However, their organization becomes a support and a symbol of man acting according to his own will. If everyone saw that the expression of the church should be local and that it must be restricted by the local ground, all these groups would no longer exist. Regardless of how good a person may be, he should be in a local church. Regardless of how spiritual he may be or how strong his desire to save sinners may be, he should be in a local church. Regardless of how good his work, motive, intent, and result are, he should not establish a group apart from the ground of the church. If he dares to establish a group apart from the ground of locality, the attitude that &ldquo;having separate groups is acceptable&rdquo; becomes his covering. A person who has the boldness to use such a covering has not seen the ground of the church. If he sees that everything related to the church must be on the ground of locality, he will not dare to establish a group apart from the ground of locality. Thus, all the groups and activities that are according to man&rsquo;s will cannot receive God&rsquo;s covering, because they are restricted by the local ground of the church.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s goal today is to annul the ground of locality in order to give people absolute freedom of action as a pretext to establish denominations. The only thing that can nullify this is the ground of the church. Once we speak concerning the ground of locality, no one has an excuse for doing whatever he desires. The ground of locality is a great restriction to our flesh, our private intentions, and our natural man.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
