   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BLESSING AS THE ISSUE OF MERCY AND GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Blessing is the issue of mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>David had a son who built the holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That was God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>David obtained the land that was the site for God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That was also God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, the holy temple was built under the oversight of David s house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That was also God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us look at another example.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the Lord s resurrection, Peter went back to his former profession.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He went fishing with some of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They labored the whole night but caught nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As soon as the morning broke, however, they listened to the Lord s word, cast their net, and hauled in a hundred and fifty-three fish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That was God s blessing John 21:3-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If God does not bless, all human labor on earth is in vain; after a whole night of labor not one fish will be gained.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose we have a big gospel meeting coming up, and we all know that we should pray and be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, we should believe in and depend on God s blessing more than our prayer and preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not trust in our prayer or our preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Blessing is the issue of God s mercy and His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the issue of God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should never think that we are able to do anything, that we have methods, are perfect, or have a good character.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such thoughts do not allow us to know mercy or grace, and they do not allow us to know God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God wants to work what He is into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If our condition is normal, what reaches us is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If our condition is abnormal, God will still visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, instead of reaching us as grace, He will be mercy to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether He reaches us as grace or mercy, the issue is blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Blessing is not the result of our effort.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Blessing is the result of God s mercy and grace reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, we may labor in a place for a while without perfecting one saint to be an elder, but if we have God s grace, a group of elders will be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This would be a work that God has accomplished, and it will be His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Theology is taught in seminaries with the expectation that spiritual people will be produced and cultivated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, it seems that there is not much result.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is God s blessing for us to be able to perfect some spiritual ones after meeting and serving in a place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Blessing is the issue of mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we live before God and follow Him, the more we will know mercy, grace, and blessing and will realize that what we have is worthless before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if we are too strong and prevent the grace of God from being manifested through us, at the necessary time God will allow us to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Either He will break our ability and intelligence, or He will break our morality and our will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may need to fall into a miserable situation so that God can give us mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This mercy will bring in a result the blessing of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The blessing will produce Solomon, and it will also gain the threshing floor of Ornan the site for the building of the holy temple, God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Blessing as the result of mercy and grace ultimately becomes God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The building up of the church is God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the result of our knowing mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The building up of the church is not the issue of our effort.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our effort can bring in only temporary prosperity that does not last; rather, it will either pass away or be broken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, our effort will cause God to raise up an environment to do a breaking work on us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He will break our strength so that the grace of God can be manifested in us according to His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The result of this breaking will bring in God s blessing.</S>
