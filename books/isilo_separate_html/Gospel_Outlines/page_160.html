<h1 class="title">THE WORD OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 Cor. 1:18-21</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The meaning of the cross
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The cross is both the instrument by which the Lord Jesus died and the place where He died.</li>
	<li>By His death on the cross the Lord Jesus bore the sins of mankind and saved man from destruction.</li>
	<li>Therefore, the cross is able to deliver man from sin and destruction.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The word of the cross
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word of the cross includes the meaning of the cross and the teaching of the cross.</li>
	<li>Those who regard the meaning and the teaching of the cross as foolishness will perish. Those who receive the word of the cross, recognizing that it is the power of God, will be saved.</li>
	<li>The reason that the meaning and the teaching of the cross can cause man to be saved is that the cross is God&rsquo;s wisdom and power. Wisdom is God&rsquo;s means; power is God&rsquo;s ability. God&rsquo;s means and ability to save man depend upon the cross.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to apply the word of the cross
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that we have sinned and deserve to perish.</li>
	<li>Acknowledge that the cross is God&rsquo;s way of salvation.</li>
	<li>Accept Jesus Christ as the Savior who died on the cross to bear our sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
