   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You from deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this meeting it is not man speaking human words but God speaking the words of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, Lord, we need You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can men listen to God's words?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can we men understand the words of God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both our listening and our understanding depend on You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, we thank You that You have made us gods.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today we are no longer merely men; we are God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we have the qualification and the capacity to listen to and understand the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are gods able to listen to the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are also gods learning to speak the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, cleanse us and cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The release of this word is really hated by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, may You fight for us because You are the Overcomer; You have already overcome the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The cross has already dealt with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the place where God is speaking to the gods.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is also the place where we know the God-man in the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lord, the time has come.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May You glorify Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the previous three chapters we have seen the Spirit of God, the spirit of man, and also the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this chapter we will see the issue of the union of these two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In eternity God is without beginning and without ending, and He is ever unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After He created the heavens, the earth, and man, for a period of four thousand years He did many things, but these things had nothing to do with the accomplishing of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, in the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, from Genesis to Malachi, what is recorded are superficial matters that are on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is like the fig tree that had only leaves and was fruitless, on which the Lord Jesus could not find any fruit Matt 21:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, when we come to the New Testament, things are no longer superficial, just on the surface; the New Testament is full of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible has been in the believers' hands for many years, but not many really know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if there are some who profess to know the Bible, I am afraid that their understanding of the Bible is superficial, just on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For many years I have had a hidden concern as to whether or not the saints have taken in the messages released by the Lord in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank the Lord that there are at least some who have taken them in. The Lord has gained some people who are skilled in the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this conference I am really rejoicing and happy to see that although they have come from different places, all the brothers and sisters prophesy with the same "tone" and speak the same words to present very clearly what the Lord has revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is what the enemy cannot annul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord's work does not take account of the outward number of people, but of how many are actually saturated by the truths and have become mingled with the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Concerning myself, although I am not highly educated, I have slowly advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some are more capable and better educated than I, yet they do not see much of the revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For many years, by the Lord's mercy, I may say that I have seen much in the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have advanced slowly, step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Consider the Life-studies as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Over the past twenty-one years, every six months, under the blessing of the Lord whom I serve, I have covered all sixty-six books of the Bible except Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord's blood cover me; this is not my boasting or bragging.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am boasting of the Lord, exalting the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have nothing, I can do nothing, and I am nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am altogether not; only the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not all that the Lord has; He will speak still more among us.</S>
