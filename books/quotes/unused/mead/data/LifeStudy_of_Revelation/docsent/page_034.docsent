   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE LAMPSTAND FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE TABERNACLE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the lampstand is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The lampstand in Exodus 25 was for the building of the tabernacle, the lampstand in Zechariah 4 was for the recovery of God s building, and the lampstands in Revelation 1 are for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the Triune God is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While Christians talk a great deal about the Trinity, very few have seen that the Triune God is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The lampstand in Exodus 25 typifies Christ as the expression of God shining with the seven lamps, the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The way the Bible presents the lampstands is very interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Firstly, the Bible reveals that for the building of the tabernacle there was the need of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The lampstand was also necessary for the function of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The tabernacle had no windows, and its entrance was completely covered by a curtain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since there were no openings, there was no way light could come in from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the lampstand shining in the tabernacle, no one inside would have been able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, the lampstand was not only for the building of the tabernacle but also for its function.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, without the lampstand, there is no building of the church and no function in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church s function depends upon the shining lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We in the church need the shining of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Often, when you consider what to do or how to do it, you find yourself confused.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more you think, the more dense the darkness becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when you come into the church meeting or fellowship with the saints, you are immediately enlightened and say, Oh, now I see the way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No one gave you a message telling you what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You were made clear by the shining of the lampstand in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The lampstand shines upon us in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The lampstand is not only for God s building, but also for the function in God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to function, we must have light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The light of the shining lampstand is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why we cannot afford to stay away from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not say, As long as I read the Bible and pray at home, everything will be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you try this, you will rush back to the church after a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, we do not like to take a vacation unless we can go to a place where there is a church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church not only has the lampstand but also is the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE LAMPSTAND FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>OF THE RECOVERED TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The lampstand is needed even more for the recovery of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Zechariah 4 reveals that the lampstand emphasizing the Spirit is for the recovery of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today, there is a greater need for the lampstand because we are not only in God s building, but also in the recovery of His building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need the lampstand to shine upon us and to strengthen us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A. Signifying the Spirit for God s Move</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For the recovery of His temple, God gave a vision to Zechariah that by it he might be able to strengthen Zerubbabel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this vision, Zechariah saw a lampstand with seven lamps into which oil was flowing from two olive trees.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then the angel said to Zechariah, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts Zech 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that the Spirit of God is for His move on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>B. With Seven Lamps Which Are the Seven Eyes</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The seven lamps on the lampstand in Zechariah are the seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Firstly, these seven eyes are the eyes of Christ as the stone for God s building Zech 4:2, 10; 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Revelation 5:6 also speaks of the seven eyes of Christ, the Lamb, saying that they are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Zechariah 3 and 4 Christ is the stone for God s building, and in Revelation 5 He is the Lamb for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This indicates that the redeeming Christ is the building stone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Both the Lamb and the stone have the seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Zechariah the seven eyes are the eyes of the stone, while in Revelation they are the eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The seven lamps, which are the seven eyes of Christ, are also the eyes of God for His move Zech 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ has the seven eyes, the seven Spirits of God, for God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Firstly, Christ is the redeeming Lamb and eventually He is the building stone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is absolutely for God s move on earth, through redemption to the goal of building.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today we are enjoying redemption for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We enjoy Christ not only as the redeeming Lamb, but also as the building stone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ s redemption is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Him we are redeemed, and in Him we are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is accomplishing this by the seven Spirits of God which are for God s move today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>C. The Lamps Being for Enlightening</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>and the Eyes Being for Transfusion by Looking</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The lamps are for enlightening, and the eyes are for transfusion by looking.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These eyes are not only for searching, observing, and judging, but especially for transfusing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whenever Christ looks at us with His seven eyes, we are spontaneously infused by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whether we are being judged, enlightened, searched, or burned, He transfuses all that He is into us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whenever Christ enlightens us, He shines into us, transfusing all that He is into us that we might become a transformed precious stone for God s building.</S>
