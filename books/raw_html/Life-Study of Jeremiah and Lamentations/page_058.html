<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE WORDS OF WISDOM<br>TO THE ERRING AND SUFFERING ISRAEL</H2><P>Jeremiah's writing in these chapters is inclusive. He wrote about Israel's hypocrisy and corruption, Jehovah's correction of Israel, his own reaction to this correction, and Jehovah's feeling regarding Israel's suffering of His correction. Finally he gave some words of wisdom to the erring and suffering Israel. As the last item in this message, we will consider these words of wisdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Word concerning Glorying in Jehovah</H2><P>Jeremiah 9:23 and 24 say that the wise man should not glory in his wisdom, the mighty man should not glory in his might, and the rich man should not glory in his riches. Rather, the one who glories should glory in that he has insight and knows Jehovah, the One who exercises lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness on earth and delights in these things. This word of wisdom about glorying in the Lord is quoted by Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:31 and 2 Corinthians 10:17.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. There Being None like Jehovah</H2><P>In Jeremiah 10:6 the prophet declares that there is none like Jehovah; He is great, and His name is great in might. In verse 7 he continues, saying, "For it befits You, / For among all the wise of the nations / And in all their kingdoms / There is none like You."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah Being the True God</H2><P>Jehovah is the true God. He is the living God and the eternal King (v. 10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jehovah Being the One<br>Who Made the Earth by His Power</H2><P>Jehovah is the One who has made the earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom. By His understanding He stretched out the heavens (v. 12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. A Man's Way Being Not in Himself</H2><P>Finally, in verse 23 Jeremiah declared that he knew that a man's way is not in himself. It is not in the man who walks to direct his step.</P>
