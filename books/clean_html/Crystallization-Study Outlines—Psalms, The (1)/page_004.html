<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 15:1; 16:1-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Psalm 16 is &ldquo;A Michtam of David&rdquo; (title); the meaning of the Hebrew word <em>michtam</em> is uncertain, but some understand it to mean &ldquo;a golden jewel (of a poem).&rdquo;</li>
<li>Psalm 16 reveals that only Christ, the God-man, can satisfy God&rsquo;s desire and fulfill His good pleasure&mdash;Matt. 3:17; 17:5; cf. Psa. 15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Only He&mdash;the very God who became a man, lived a human life full of the divine attributes expressed in human virtues, died, resurrected, and ascended to the right hand of God&mdash;is perfect according to the law and can sojourn in God&rsquo;s tabernacle and dwell with God on His holy mountain&mdash;v. 1.</li>
	<li>In God&rsquo;s economy only the God-man Christ as the firstborn Son of God with His many brothers as the many sons of God (Rom. 8:29) can satisfy God&rsquo;s desire and fulfill His good pleasure.</li>
	</ol></li>

	<li>In His human living, the Lord Jesus loved God the Father (John 14:31), and He had His delight in the saints in God&rsquo;s kingdom.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;The sorrows of them who bartered for some other god will be multiplied; / Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, / Nor will I take up their names upon my lips&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 16:4:

	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;The measuring lines have fallen on pleasant places for me; / Indeed the inheritance is beautiful to me&rdquo;&mdash;v. 6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ chose nothing for Himself; He left His destiny and all the choices to His Father&mdash;Matt. 11:25-30.</li>
	<li>Christ appreciated the possession given by God to Him under the measuring lines on pleasant places and the beautiful inheritance given to Him by God&mdash;Psa. 2:8; Rev. 11:15; cf. 2 Cor. 10:7-18.</li>

	<li>Christ was willing and happy to die for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus rested physically in His burial, waiting to be resurrected.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, / Nor let Your Holy One see the pit&rdquo;&mdash;v. 10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God would not abandon Christ&rsquo;s soul to Sheol (Hades), nor let His body see corruption, decay.</li>

	<li>In His ascension Christ is enjoying pleasures forever at God&rsquo;s right hand.</li>
