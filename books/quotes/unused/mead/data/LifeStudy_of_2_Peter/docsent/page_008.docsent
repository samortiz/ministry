   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL THINGS RELATED TO LIFE AND GODLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This allotment contains all things related to life and godliness, including the divine nature and the precious and exceedingly great promises.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But how can these promises be counted among the content of the allotment?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us use the illustration of a will in answering this question.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose your father s will says that you have a certain inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Your inheritance is what is written in your father s will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The will not only tells you about certain things; it tells you that these things are your portion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, this will is a fulfilled promise.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the will, a fulfilled promise, includes all the items of your inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this sense, the will, the promise, and the inheritance are all one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In like manner, concerning the things related to life and godliness, including the divine nature, the promises actually are the will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Testament is a testament, not merely a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In today s terms, it is a new will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The twenty-seven books of the New Testament are a will telling us of the items of our rich inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the will and the inheritance are one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>An inheritance without a will would be lacking something very important.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we did not have the New Testament, which is a new will, how would we know what God has promised us concerning our inheritance?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The allotted faith, our portion, includes all things related to life and godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we have seen, it also includes the divine nature and the promises.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All this is included in the allotted faith, in the portion God has allotted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE GIVING OF PRECIOUS</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to verse 3, the Lord has called us not only by His glory and virtue, but also to His glory and virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The disciples saw the Lord s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the time He was with them, they saw the virtue in His conduct and daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They also saw His glory on the mount of transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I believe that they also saw the Lord s glory at other times, for example, when He fed the five thousand and when He called Lazarus out of the tomb.</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to live by the divine life so that we may be partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To partake of the divine nature simply means to enjoy the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After we experienced the click, all things pertaining to life and godliness were imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we have the divine life.</S>
