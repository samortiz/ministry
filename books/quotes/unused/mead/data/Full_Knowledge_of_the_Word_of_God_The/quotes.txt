[2]  The messages contained in this book and in two related books entitled Everyone Speaking the Word of God and Meeting to Speak the Word of God were given in October, 1985 in Taipei, Taiwan during a training in which the author spoke three times daily.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE ESSENCE OF GOD'S WORD Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:4; John 17:17; 2 Tim 3:16; 1 Pet 2:2; Matt 4:4; John 6:63; 1:1, 14 OUTLINE The essence of God's Word: The divine breath 2 Tim 3:16.
[4]  In addition, when you pray-read, you need to look at the subject and the main points.
[5]  The subject this morning is "The Full Knowledge of the Word of God."
[6]  Therefore, when you pray-read 1 Timothy 2:4, "Who desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth," you should not dwell on the phrase "who desires all men to be saved," because the subject is not salvation but knowing the truth.
[7]  GOD DESIRING ALL MEN TO COME TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH
[8]  Now let us see the essence of God's Word in a simple way.
[9]  If we want to know God's Word, we must know the essence of God's Word.
[10]  Therefore, when we read the Bible, we must understand that the Bible is not merely black words on white paper, but it is the breathing out of God.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO THE WAY TO UNDERSTAND THE WORD OF GOD 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 6:17-18; Jer 15:16; 1 Pet 2:2; 2 Tim 3:16; 2 Cor 3:6 OUTLINE The way to understand the Word of God: Understanding the Word of God literally.
[12]  Eating, drinking, and breathing the Spirit and the life in the Word of God Jer 15:16; 1 Pet 2:2; 2 Tim 3:16.
[13]  When we read the Bible, the first way to understand the Word of God is to comprehend it literally.
[14]  When we read the Bible, we should not interpret arbitrarily a passage that we do not understand, thus departing from the meaning of the Word.
[15]  Second, we need to use our spirit to pray-read the Word of God.
[16]  The Bible does have some "skins" and some "feathers," but within these things is the revelation of life.
[17]  However, when we read the Bible, we are often hindered by the outward things.
[18]  Even though we cannot find the word "dispensing" in the Bible, still the fact of dispensing is in the Bible, just as the term "the Triune God" is not in the Bible, yet there is the fact of the Triune God.
[19]  First, Christ, the life-giving Spirit, who is God Himself, comes into our spirit, causing our spirit to have the life of God v. 10 . Then He desires to enter into our mind, which is the major part of our soul, so that our soul may have the life of God v. 6 . Last, He supplies His life to our body v. 11 . Thus our spirit, soul, and body all have His life.
[20]  By His coming and going, He brought God into man and man into God.
[21]  For example, when the Sadducees argued with the Lord Jesus, saying that there was no resurrection, the Lord Jesus answered, "Concerning the dead, that they are raised, did you not read in the book of Moses, at the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?"
[22]  Concerning the matter of understanding God's Word, I have mentioned four points.
[23]  They exhaust their minds to study the letter of the Bible, but they do not use their spirit to pray-read the Word of God.
[24]  THE WAY TO UNDERSTAND GOD'S WORD Paying Attention to the Context in Reading the Bible
[25]  Now we will continue what we talked about in the previous message concerning the matter of taking care of the context in our reading of the Bible.
[26]  We must realize that we were not born in the first century; we are not the first group of Bible readers.
[27]  In addition, during the first half of the last century, in the late 1820s, the Lord raised up the Brethren in England.
[28]  The Brethren told us that in order to interpret these prophecies, one must maintain two governing principles.
[29]  First, in Daniel 2 there is a great image, the head of which is of fine gold; the arms, of silver; the belly, of brass; the legs, of iron; and the feet, partly of iron and partly of clay.
[30]  CHAPTER FOUR SOME IMPORTANT ITEMS OF THE TRUTH THAT HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:4; Eph 3:9-11; 1:9-10; 3:2-4; Col 1:25-27; Eph 3:8; 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 3:10; 1:23; 3:19 OUTLINE Some important items of the truth that have been misunderstood: God's economy 1 Tim 1:4: God's household administration, arrangement, and plan Eph 3:9-11.
[31]  The stewardship of God's household administration: Understanding the mystery of Christ the church Eph 3:2-4.
[32]  Completing the word of God, that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, the glory of which is Christ in the believers, the hope of glory Col 1:25-27.
[33]  Beginning from this morning we are in "graduate school" and the lessons are weighty.
[34]  The first thing we need to mention is that today, in the twentieth century, if we want to know the Bible, we need to learn from the examples of the early saints.
[35]  Many Bible scholars raised up by the Lord had a thorough understanding of the Bible.
[36]  The purpose of my speaking concerning this is for you to know that before the Reformation led by Martin Luther, even during the time the Bible was locked up by the Roman Catholic church, there were still some raised up by the Lord to know the Bible.
[37]  By this we see that there were three periods: from the apostles to the Council of Nicaea 325 A.D. , from the Council of Nicaea to about 590 A.D., and the centuries during which the Bible was locked up by the Catholic church.
[38]  One hundred years after Luther's Reformation, Protestantism became dead, just as in the epistle of the Lord Jesus to the church in Sardis: "You have a name that you are living, and you are dead" Rev 3:1 .
[39]  In this chapter, which speaks of the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, Andrew Murray pointed out that today the Holy Spirit is different from the Spirit of God in the Old Testament.
[40]  He is called not only the Spirit of God Rom 8:9 but also the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 and the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 ; hence, the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[41]  Based on this, I boldly say that today the Spirit of God has become the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and that this Spirit is a compound Spirit.
[42]  We can see that from the time of the Apostles, through the time of the Council of Nicaea, and continuing until the twentieth century, there have been Bible scholars in every generation.
[43]  In this message we come to a very important subject, that is, some important truths that have been misunderstood.
[44]  Today, five of the greatest Bible truths are being ignored and misunderstood by people: God's economy, God's dispensing, the divine Trinity, the God-Man Jesus, and the mingling of God and man.
[45]  Ephesians 3:9-11 says, "And to bring to light what is the dispensation economy of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things; in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the church the multifarious wisdom of God, according to the purpose of the ages which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[46]  CHAPTER FIVE SOME IMPORTANT ITEMS OF THE TRUTH THAT HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; Eph 4:6; Heb 1:8; Acts 5:3-4; Isa 9:6; Heb 1:12; 7:3; 9:14; John 14:10-11; 5:43; 14:26; 15:26; 6:46; 8:29; 10:30; Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20; John 16:14-15; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17; Matt 1:18, 20, 21, 23; Rom 9:5; Col 2:9; 1 Tim 2:5; Acts 7:56; Rev 1:13; Matt 26:64; Rev 14:14; John 1:51, 12-13; Rom 11:24; John 6:48, 57; 7:37-39; 1 Cor 6:17; Lev 2:4 OUTLINE Some important items of the truth that have been misunderstood: The divine Trinity Matt 28:19: The Father, the Son, and the Spirit all being God the only one God Eph 4:6; Heb 1:8; Acts 5:3-4.
[47]  The Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexisting simultaneously from eternity to eternity Isa 9:6; Heb 1:12; 7:3; 9:14.
[48]  The Father, the Son, and the Spirit coinhering and being inseparable John 14:10-11; 5:43; 14:26; 15:26.
[49]  Born as God and man a God-man being the complete God Rom 9:5; Col 2:9 and the perfect man 1 Tim 2:5 Isa 9:6, the child being called the mighty God.
[50]  BEING CONCERNED FOR THE FULL-TIME BROTHERS AND SISTERS
[51]  I am concerned about the more than two hundred full-timers who are here.
[52]  In that verse the Lord commanded the disciples, saying, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[53]  Although the Triune God was revealed in the Old Testament, it was not until the Lord Jesus, who is God, passed through four crucial steps incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection that He spoke to His disciples before ascending to heaven, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.
[54]  Hence, to baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit is to baptize people into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[55]  Thus, it was after His resurrection that the Lord Jesus clearly spoke of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, because before His resurrection, the Spirit of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit was not yet completed.
[56]  Ephesians 4:6 says that the Father is God; Hebrews 1:8 says that the Son is God; and Acts 5:3-4 says that the Spirit is God.
[57]  One is called modalism, which speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as follows: In the beginning God was the Father, and afterwards He became the Son.
[58]  Thus there is only one God with three modes; the Three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit do not exist simultaneously, but rather in succession.
[59]  Fifty years ago Wong Ming-Dao, a famous Chinese preacher, spoke strongly that the Father is a God, the Son is a God, and the Spirit is a God; thus, there are three Gods.
[60]  Now we come to the fourth point the God-man Jesus.
[61]  As a God-man, the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit, thus having the divine element Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 .
