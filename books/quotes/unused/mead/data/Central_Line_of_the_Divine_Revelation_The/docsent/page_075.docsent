   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>W. As the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Directing the Move of the Ministers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of Christ through the Inward Guidance</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>by the Divine Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The all-inclusive Spirit as the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus directs the move of the ministers of Christ through the inward guidance by the divine dispensing Acts 16:6-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Acts 16 Paul and his co-workers were traveling in Asia Minor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They wanted to turn toward Asia, but they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit v. 6 ; then they attempted to go to Bithynia, but they were prohibited by the Spirit of Jesus v. 7 . Eventually, they stopped, and in the night Paul had a vision concerning a Macedonian man who entreated the brothers to come over to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul and his co-workers concluded that God had called them to bring the good news into Macedonia vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They crossed the Aegean Sea and entered into eastern Europe and into the major city of that region, Philippi vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul and his co-workers had both the outward guidance and the inward guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The dream in which the Macedonian man said, "Come over into Macedonia and help us" was the outward guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The inward guidance came as they considered the dream and concluded that God had called them to announce the good news to the Macedonians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This inward guidance was through the Spirit by the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through the leading of the Spirit, Paul and his co-workers received some amount of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was their inward guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today we must take this as our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Often the co-workers come to me and say, "Brother Lee, I have received an invitation to go to a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Should I go or not?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Usually, I do not say whether or not they should go.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I simply tell them to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I say this, my consideration is that they should receive a "Macedonian call."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once they receive the call, following Paul's pattern, they need to consider.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This consideration is inward in the human spirit with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>X. As the Renewing Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Transforming Us with All the Attributes</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>of Christ into the Glorious Image</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>of the Resurrected and Glorified Christ</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the renewing Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit transforms us with the attributes of Christ into the glorious image of the resurrected and glorified Christ that we may bear His image for His glory 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 12:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The attributes of Christ include many items, such as His humility, His patience, and His kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When they are expressed outwardly, these items are Christ's virtues, but within Christ, they are His attributes.</S>
