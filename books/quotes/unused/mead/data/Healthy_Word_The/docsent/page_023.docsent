   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sensing God s Presence</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When We Come to the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever we come to the Bible with a sincere heart and an open spirit, we immediately touch Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Often when we come to the Bible, we have a deep sense that we have entered into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we read a few verses, we not only understand something outwardly, but we also touch something inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible Being God s Breath</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We come into the presence of God when we come to the Bible, because the Bible is God s breath.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second Timothy 3:16 says, All Scripture is God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible is not only the word of God but also God s breath and even God s breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we come to the Word of God, after only a few minutes we will be inwardly refreshed, comforted, nourished, watered, strengthened, and enlightened by the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have often come to the Word with a heavy heart, but after reading a few verses, I am refreshed within.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This happens because God s breathing is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as we can be refreshed physically by rising early and breathing deeply in the fresh morning air, so we can be refreshed spiritually by coming to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the life-giving Spirit, God always accompanies His word John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Wherever His word goes, the life-giving Spirit goes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Countless sinners have been converted simply by reading the Bible, and countless Christians have been transformed by reading this living book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are transformed not by teaching or admonishing but by reading the Bible to contact the breathing of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some believers may think that they do not need to read the Bible, because afterward they do not remember what they have read.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They may suppose that it is useless to continually read and forget.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, we do not remember all the air that we breathe in, yet we would never say that we do not need to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our purpose in coming to the Bible is not primarily to memorize but to be refreshed and enlivened by God s breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to be healthy spiritually, we need to come to the Bible every morning to enter into God s breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This breathing clears us up inwardly and supplies us for the rest of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This practice influences our mental and physical health as well, for it takes away our unnecessary worries and anxieties and brings us joy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we become joyful in the spirit through breathing in God s word, we will be the most balanced people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have a healthy time early in the morning in the Word of God, all the negative things will be carried away, and Christ as the life-giving Spirit will be our joy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The way for one s abnormal condition to be healed is by contacting the living Lord through the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we spend time in the Word every morning, we will become the most healthy and normal person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will be sober in our thinking, balanced in our emotion, and proper in our will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, our heart will be pure, our conscience will be void of offense, and our spirit will be open.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our body will be healthy, and our mind will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are blessed to have the Word without and the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because we have had these two wires installed, our only need is to keep them switched on to enjoy the heavenly transmission of the rich, all-inclusive Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, this wonderful Christ will fully constitute us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then, like the apostle Paul, we will be able to say, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For to me, to live is Christ Phil 1:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the proper Christian life and the proper church life in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord today is not recovering doctrines, practices, or forms; He is recovering Christ as our life and our everything for the proper Christian life and church life.</S>
