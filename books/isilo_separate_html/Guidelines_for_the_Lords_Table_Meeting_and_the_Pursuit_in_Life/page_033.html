<p><em>Question: When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was obedient even unto death. Do we also need to be obedient unto death?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The Lord Jesus first bore the cross and then was crucified; He was obedient unto death. We, however, are crucified and then bear the cross; the bearing of the cross also requires obedience from us. When we believe in the Lord, the first thing we need to do is to be baptized. This means that once we receive the Lord as our Savior, the first thing we need is to be baptized. What is baptism? Romans 6:3 says, &ldquo;Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?&rdquo; The first thing that God wants us to do, after receiving the Lord, is to enter into the death of the cross of Christ, to be baptized into His death. After baptism, we must begin to take the way of obeying the Lord. After we believe into the Lord, we need to be baptized; after baptism, we need to begin living a life of obedience and taking the way of obedience. This obedient living begins with Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. After we believed in the Lord, He put us into the death of Christ, and from that point forward we could begin to obey God.</p>
<p>After baptism, however, many people turn from the Lord&rsquo;s death and do not bear the cross. Not bearing the cross means that we are not living in the death of the cross. If we have seen what it means to be baptized into Christ&rsquo;s death, we will know that we are in the Lord&rsquo;s death, and this death has been wrought into us even after our baptism.</p>
<p>For example, a renowned doctor of chemistry, who had a strong mind having read many books and having studied in Germany, believed in the Lord. Then we told him that he needed to be baptized and that the meaning of baptism was to die and be buried with Christ. The day after his baptism, we saw him again and talked about his believing in the Lord. As we began our conversation, his doctor-of-chemistry mind began to come out again. But immediately after saying, &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he stopped himself.</p>
<p>From his fellowship with the brothers he knew that believing in the Lord is to be joined to the Lord and to fellowship with Him, and that being baptized meant to die and be buried. On the day of his baptism, God shined a mysterious light into his being. The next day when he was about to express his opinion, he could not continue. Death was operating in him, saying, &ldquo;I thought the <em>I</em> in <em>I think</em> was buried. Why are you trying to come out of the tomb?&rdquo; After this he could only say, &ldquo;O Lord, what do You think? What will You say? It is no longer I but Christ. It is no longer I that live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; The words he sang in his baptism, &ldquo;Already dead! And buried too! / With the old man I am through!&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #938), was not merely a saying but a revelation which was sown into him and was operating in him so that <em>I</em> and <em>I think</em> would no longer be expressed.</p>
<p>He did not live by man&rsquo;s exhortation; he lived by the spiritual reality of death. This is the way of a Christian, and this is the need of a Christian. Asceticism is futile; neither does devotion avail anything. The way of a Christian is the seeing of &ldquo;death&rdquo;; the way of a Christian is death. Hence, we need to bear in mind that death is what God accomplished and it is the mark of the Christian life. The Christian life begins with baptism, and the meaning of baptism is that we leave, and Christ comes; we are finished, and Christ begins; we die, and Christ lives. This is not only the case on the day of our baptism; it will be this way to the last day of our life. Only those who know the death of the cross of Christ know the deep mystery of being a Christian.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO STOP AND RECEIVE LIGHT</h2>
<p><em>Question: Is seeing progressive? Is the degree to which we see the degree to which we stop?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The first thing is not to see but to stop. Of course, there are some stronger ones who first see and then stop, but ordinary people generally stop first. Saul of Tarsus, a well-known person throughout the centuries, was breathing threatening on his way to Damascus. There were some people he wanted to seize and others he wanted to kill. However, the shining in Damascus subdued him. Once the light shined upon him, his entire being stopped. Previously he led people, but now he had to be led. Moreover, because his eyes were blind, he had no choice but to stop. When we pause, God&rsquo;s light will be able to shine in us. If we are willing to stop for a little, God&rsquo;s light will shine in us a little; if God&rsquo;s light shines in us more, we will see more. The more we see, the more we will stop; the more we stop, the more we will see. This is the principle.</p>
<p>In church history Andrew Murray was a good example of one who saw gradually and stopped gradually. In his writings he often spoke of being quiet and fearful. When we stop ourselves a little, God will speak to us a little; if we receive His speaking, we will continue to stop ourselves. Hence, it is exceedingly important for us to learn to stop our mind before the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
