<p>A number of saints in the church are serving either part time or full time, and still more saints have a heart to serve full time. Seventy percent of these saints are young people. When the work began in Taiwan, this generation of young people was not born yet. We thank the Lord that these young saints have come into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We must not waste the time of these saints. We must make progress.</p>
<p>We should not blame anyone or anything for the past. There is a Chinese proverb that politicians like to use, which says, &ldquo;Circumstances often create a hero, but a hero creates circumstances.&rdquo; These are two views of the same thing. Those who are wise use their circumstances to distinguish themselves and to make history. I would therefore encourage the co-workers not to waste their time but to open new frontiers, new circumstances, and new prospects. We need to create new opportunities and grasp these opportunities in our labor. Frankly speaking, our situation does not require us to create more opportunities. Thirty-five years ago we came to Taiwan and opened up many frontiers. Now there are many brothers and sisters from many localities. We do not need to create any more opportunities. Our need is to grasp the opportunities that are available. To labor is to grasp the opportunities. If there are no opportunities, we should create some. It is regrettable that year after year we have not grasped these opportunities. Those who allow the opportunities to pass have hundreds of excuses, but no excuse is valid.</p>
<p>Our eyes need to be opened. Taiwan may be a small island, but there are still many towns and villages that do not have a church life and need to be gained. We must raise up a church in these towns and villages. We should not worry about financial provisions. If we fall into this trap, we have become degraded. We are not beginning a new work, we are not going out under a new banner, nor are we starting another recovery. We are one, and we will keep this oneness. The co-workers go out to open new prospects and new opportunities. Even if we should suffer hunger, we will continue until churches are raised up. If all the workers have such a spirit, in two or three years more churches will be raised up. There will even be churches raised up in the neighboring towns.</p>
<p>If we lose the aspiration to create new prospects and new opportunities and instead hold on to our old meetings, we will eventually be discouraged. Going to a town or a village to lead people to salvation, raise up a church, and bring the newly saved ones to serve the Lord is much more valuable than earning all the money in the world. Raising up a church in a town is much more worthwhile than starting a new factory. Making a profit of ten million U.S. dollars cannot be compared to going to a village and raising up one hundred new believers to meet together and serve the Lord. These one hundred souls are more valuable than ten million U.S. dollars. Only this kind of pioneering spirit can stir up the interest of the young saints and cause them to rise up to follow and also serve. In this way, in a few years there will be churches everywhere in Taiwan. Such a pioneering spirit will become our family heritage, and the young saints will be useful and capable. This word is not only to the young saints but also to the co-workers who have been trained for many years. May we not lose this pioneering spirit ever again.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago I went to the United States with nothing in my pockets, and I did not receive any financial support from any of the churches in the Far East. It was under difficult circumstances that I went to the United States to open up a new frontier. My going forth was to create an opportunity. The work in Taiwan now is much easier. The young saints should take this word to heart. When we go forth to labor in the schools, we should forget all that is behind us. The old ways are not profitable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COORDINATING TOGETHER<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL IN THE SCHOOLS</h2>
<p>In order to coordinate together to preach the gospel in the schools, there needs to be a number of full-time co-workers who will receive the burden to facilitate the gospel in the schools. We need at least two or three brothers to coordinate together. These full-time brothers should facilitate the gospel work in the schools, including junior high schools, high schools, technical colleges, and universities. The full-timers, especially those who are under the age of thirty, will be assigned to specific schools to carry out the gospel work.</p>
<p>We also need to identify the saints who are under the age of thirty and serve part time. We need to study how these saints can use their spare time. Every block of time is an opportune time for the gospel work in schools, whether it is in the morning, the afternoon, or the evening. The only time that might be difficult to use is the early morning. Therefore, we will ask all the saints who serve part time to fill out a form so that we know who is available at different times each day and can make allocations for the gospel work. This is useful information. If we know that at a certain time every day some part-time brothers or sisters are available to coordinate for the gospel, it will be easy for us to make arrangements. In principle, the saints who serve part time should also participate in the gospel work in the schools.</p>
<p>Hence, we need at least three groups of saints for the gospel in the schools: two or three matured co-workers to facilitate the gospel work, younger full-timers, and part-time brothers and sisters. In addition, there is the need for a fourth group of saints, those who are teachers or staff in the schools. We need to know how many saints are teaching in the schools and how many are burdened to coordinate in the gospel work. The fifth group of saints is very useful in facilitating the gospel work in the schools. This last group of saints is the students who are studying and are willing to participate in the gospel work. We will therefore have five groups of saints: two or three co-workers who take the lead, the younger full-timers, the part-timers, the saints who work in the schools, and the saints who are students.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
