SHADOWS OF CHRIST</H2><P>All of the days, signs, seasons, and years are shadows. Christ is the reality (Col. 2:16-17). Christ is the holy day, Christ is the new moon, Christ is the sabbath day, Christ is the beginning of the year, Christ is everything. Christ is your new beginning&#151;a greater beginning as a year and a smaller beginning as a day. Christ is the new moon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. LIGHTS STRENGTHENED</H2><P>During the time of the millennium, the age of the kingdom, the light of the moon will equal the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like seven days (Isa. 30:26). The Spirit of God intensified becomes the seven Spirits; the sun intensified becomes the sevenfold sunlight. This will happen during the age of the kingdom, the time of restoration when God will heal His people. However, we can have a foretaste today. With some of the saints, the moon is as bright as the sun. To me, the church life is just like the sun, much stronger than the ordinary moon. I have a bright moon, as bright as the sunshine and the sun has sevenfold, intensified sunlight.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. ULTIMATELY THERE WILL BE NO MORE NIGHT</H2><P>In the New Jerusalem, there will be no night (Rev. 21:23, 25b; 22:5). In that city there will be no need for the sun or the moon or any lamp because the Triune God will be the light. If we read Revelation carefully, we will see that outside the New Jerusalem, outside the city, there will still be day and night, but inside the city there will be no night. We will have our Triune God as the perfect and unique light shining over us. The days will be twenty-four hours long.</P><P>Today, however, we need the fourth-day lights. We especially need the moon and the stars to reflect the light of the sun. This is the way for us to grow. I hope that the Lord will speak to you concerning your growth, that your growth in life is with the fourth-day lights. The first-day light was good for generating life, good for your rebirth. But, for your growth in life you need the fourth-day lights.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
