   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR THE LIFE-RELEASING DEATH OF CHRIST Date: December 17, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Luke 12:49-50; John 12:24; 14:16-20; 2 Cor 5:16 THREE ASPECTS OF THE DEATH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are three aspects of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is the aspect of His substitution for us, the aspect of His identification with us, and the aspect of His releasing His life for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All three aspects of His death are needed in order to make God's way of redemption complete.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we only had one of these three aspects, we might feel insecure and might think that God's salvation was not trustworthy or complete.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We might feel that God's salvation is like the light in this room tonight, flickering and dimming intermittently.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All three aspects of the Lord's death are important.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, there is the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His blood speaks of His death as a substitution for us; He shed His precious blood on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, the Lord's death on the cross speaks of His identifying death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not have any part in the shedding of His blood, but we can have a part in His cross, because when the Lord went to the cross, He brought us along with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to know what the Bible says, and we also have to know what the Bible does not say.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible says that we have been crucified with Christ, but it does not say that we have participated in the shedding of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot say that we have a part in the shedding of Christ's blood, but we can definitely say that we have been crucified with Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, the Lord's flesh refers to the aspect of His death that released His life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This aspect of the Lord's death has nothing to do with God or man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It refers to His flesh being given for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord released His own life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The flesh signifies the Lord's life, the life released through the Lord Jesus' death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why it speaks of His flesh, not His corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus was God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet He came to the earth, putting on a body of flesh and having the life of man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order for Him to release His life, He first had to put off His human physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Luke 12:49-50 He said, "I have come to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word "pressed" means "constricted" in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Fire" does not refer to a physical fire that is lit by a match or any other kind of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The expression "cast fire on the earth" proves that this fire is not from the earth, but from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The book of Hebrews says that our God is a consuming fire 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here fire signifies God's life, which is the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord wanted to see all men filled with His fire, that is, His life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when the Lord spoke these words, they had not received His life yet.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, He said, "I have come to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Following this He said, "I have a baptism to be baptized with."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a strange word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Was not the Lord already baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was baptized in Luke 3; it had been done already.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He had been baptized at least three years earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why did He say that He had a baptism to be baptized with?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to realize that baptism in this verse refers to His death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The meaning of baptism is death and burial.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was right to say that the Lord still had "a baptism to be baptized with."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This meant that the matter had not been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time, the Lord had not passed through death, signified by baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>CHRIST'S LIFE-RELEASING DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's life originally filled the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But after Christ was incarnated, it was limited by His flesh and was bound.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God had no way to dispense His life to men.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First, His life entered the flesh of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord's aspiration was to put off His body through the consummation of His baptism so that He could dispense His life to men.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Luke 12:49 and 50 are the two most precious verses in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time the Lord's baptism had not yet been consummated, and although the twelve disciples were very close to Him, they could not obtain any life from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why we say that the third aspect of the Lord's death has nothing to do with God or man; it was His own aspiration for the release and liberation of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can see this even more clearly from John 12:24, which says, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The death of the grain of wheat has nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Neither does it have anything to do with identification.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The death of the grain of wheat is a life-releasing death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Life is in the grain of wheat, but this life is surrounded by the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you put a grain of wheat on the table, nothing will ever happen; it will forever remain as one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It has to be planted in the ground, allowing the shell to break, fall off, and decay through the action of water.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only then will life sprout forth, take root downward, and branch and grow upward.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After two or three months, a hundred grains will be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Each of the grains will be impregnated with life, and the life within each grain will be derived from the one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the same way, when the only begotten Son of God died, millions of God's sons were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Before the Lord's incarnation, God's life was abstract and untouchable.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After the Lord was born, God's life was locked in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, the Lord went to Golgotha and was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This released God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God's original intention was for His only begotten Son to become the firstborn Son so that He could have many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Through the death of the only begotten Son, His life was released, and this life produced many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The one grain has become a hundred grains.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There are now one plus one hundred grains.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Originally, the one grain was unique.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Now it has become the first of many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Before the Lord's resurrection, God had only one Son.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After the Lord's resurrection, God had many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Before His resurrection, Christ was God's only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After His resurrection, Christ was God's firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord told Mary on the day of His resurrection of "My Father and your Father" John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Originally, the Father was only the Father to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We were not able to call God our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After Christ was crucified on Golgotha and after His resurrection, He was no longer just the only begotten Son of God; He became the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Hebrews 2:11 says, "For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Just as the Lord Jesus received His life from God, we have received our life from God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Our life is the same as His.</S>
