<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE NINETY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BEING MATURED<br>THE MANIFESTATION OF MATURITY</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>g) Prophesying with Blessing</H2><P>In this message we shall consider another manifestation of Jacob's maturity in life: his prophesying with blessing (49:1-28). Although we are familiar with what it means to prophesy, we may not be familiar with prophesying with blessing. Genesis 49 is the only chapter that reveals this matter. Although Moses' blessing in Deuteronomy 33 is close to what is found in Genesis 49, the blessing there is not as rich as the blessing here. Both portions of the Word are prophecies concerning Israel, but in Genesis 49 there is a richer blessing than in Deuteronomy 33.</P><P>The prophesying in chapter forty-nine is a manifestation of maturity, for our speaking always reveals where we are and how mature we are. A baby cannot speak at all, but a child over a year old may begin to say a few words. His speaking reveals that he is a small child. It is the same with other age groups: a young man speaks like a young man, a middle-aged person like a middle-aged person, and a grandfather like a grandfather. Hence, our speaking not only represents our age, but also the kind of person we are. If you are quick, you will not speak slowly. If you are slow, you will not speak quickly. If you are a high person, you will not speak in a low way, and if you are a low person, you will not speak on a high level. Thus, our speaking reveals what we are and where we are.</P><P>It has been said that the wisest thing to do is not to speak at all. If I stood before a group of people without saying anything, they would not know whether I was deep or shallow, quick or slow. I would be a mystery. However, during the past fourteen years, every fiber of my being has been revealed to you all through my speaking. Even children seven or eight years old know me rather well because they have listened to my speaking. Because I speak so much, I am not able to conceal myself. The best way to conceal yourself is not to speak. During my early years in the ministry, I was quite wise, for I never said anything in the conferences of the co-workers. Because that was my policy, I was a mystery to the other co-workers, and no one could understand me. Although it is difficult to speak, it is more difficult not to speak. When the opportunity presents itself, you simply will not be able to refrain from speaking. I doubt if you could stay with me for sixty minutes and not say a word. I am certain that after a few minutes you would be speaking.</P><P>Now let us briefly trace the matter of Jacob's speaking as it is revealed in Genesis. The first record of his speaking is in 25:31, where Jacob said to Esau, "Sell me this day thy birthright." Gaining the birthright was the desire of Jacob's heart; it was his dream and aspiration. For a long time he had been waiting for the opportunity to get it away from Esau. When the opportunity finally came, the first word out of Jacob's mouth recorded in Scripture was the word about selling the birthright.</P>
