   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Status and Position of a Virgin</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, at the beginning of Matthew 25 the Lord said, At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom v. 1 . This shows us that the status and position of those who belong to the Lord is that of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word for virgin used by the Jews has the same meaning as the word used by the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In China a virgin never leaves her house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She is always hidden and shut inside her chamber.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The status and position of a Christian on this earth should be like that of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He should be hidden, having little involvement or contact with the outside world, and he should be pure and sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Condition of a Virgin</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, all the virgins took their lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that they were in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At nighttime it is dark, and lamps are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today s age is the age of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this world of darkness Christians should shine like lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What the Lord meant in Matthew 25 was that those who belong to the Lord have lamps in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have light and can shine in the dark.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A person who truly belongs to the Lord is always much brighter than the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, it is a pity that many saints have forsaken their status as virgins and do not take their lamps and shine as they should.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Way of a Virgin</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Third, the way of the virgins is that they went forth; that is, they went out from their original place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is what it means to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were born into the world and were raised up in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The world was where we lived.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, after we were saved, we became people who are going out of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Life of a Virgin</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fourth, why did the virgins go out?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They went out because they wanted to meet the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This tells us that there should be only one purpose in our life and work to meet the Lord and to wait for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that the Holy Spirit would speak to us and reveal to us that a Christian s status and position is that of a virgin, his condition is to take his lamp to shine, his way is to go out of the world, and the purpose of his life is to wait for the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only such a Christian is a normal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May we all have ears to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not heed these words, then these words will not save us but condemn us when we meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Please do not forget that on June 12, 1955 a man in Manila cried out to you, saying, The Lord is commanding us to watch and be ready and to be virgins taking our lamps and going forth to meet the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You cannot say that you have not heard these words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These words are the gospel and words of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you do not receive them, they will condemn you one day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I hope we would not be indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May we all receive these words and repent of our past condition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May we be virgins, taking our shining lamps and going out of this world to meet Christ our Bridegroom.</S>
