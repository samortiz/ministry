   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THIS IS A FINE WORK CARRIED OUT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY THE TRANSFORMATION OF</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE SANCTIFYING SPIRIT IN THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second Corinthians 4:16-17 says, "Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word decaying means "being consumed."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our outer man is being consumed, but our inner man is being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God washes and renews our new man by consuming our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more we are consumed, the more we should be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regretfully, I have seen a number of saints being consumed without being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I saw some brothers in business make mistakes and lose much money.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They suffered very much, but with them there was no growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, every loss should, on the one hand, consume our old man, and on the other hand, help to renew our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should be washed through our sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be washed is to be renewed, and to be renewed is to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we suffer because of our roommate, this should consume our outward being so that our inner man can be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may be a proud person, so God may match you with an unsatisfactory roommate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every day this roommate becomes an instrument to consume you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God matched you with such a person for your renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God also matches a brother with a certain wife to consume him so that his inner man can be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a brother is being renewed, regardless of how his wife behaves, he will not complain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the real growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. A Daily Process</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Romans 12:2b says that we need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a daily process, not a once-for-all matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our marriage life is part of this process for us to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not one husband on this earth is perfect, and not one wife is completely satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In human terms we need to be adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In spiritual terms we need to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With a renewed person, there is no complaining, because he believes in God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Things may be wrong, but the Lord will still bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as we have God's blessing, everything will turn out for our good, that is, for our transformation and eventual conformation Rom 8:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all have to learn the lesson to have ourselves daily and hourly processed by being consumed and renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>B. A Metabolic Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our being renewed issues in a metabolic transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In metabolism some new element replaces and discharges the old element.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our renewing is always a transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After a period of time, others should be able to see some renewing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that there is a new situation in us, in our living and in our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be renewed in all the details of our daily life.</S>
