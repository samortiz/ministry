   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN 1 Scripture Reading: John 14:2-3; 2:16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John are a message given by the Lord Jesus during His last night on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Knowing that He would be put to death the next day, during the evening He gave this message to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The message in these chapters may be considered the deepest revelation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After giving this message, the Lord Jesus offered the prayer to the Father recorded in chapter seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, chapter seventeen may be considered the concluding prayer of the message in chapters fourteen through sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Later we shall see the content of this message.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I would remind you that the title of this series of messages is "The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Christians do not realize that the writings of John, especially his Gospel, are the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may find this difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After much deep study, we have come to realize the fact that the tabernacle and the offerings in the Old Testament are fulfilled in the writings of John.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>GOD'S DWELLING PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to see the significance of the tabernacle and all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The tabernacle is God's dwelling place on earth among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The tabernacle as God's dwelling place among His people on earth is actually the center and reality of the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may say that the universe, which is composed of the heavens, the earth, and billions of items, is a huge container.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What does the universe contain?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, the universe contains God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, God wants His redeemed people to be His dwelling place in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The universe contains God's people, and God's people are His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, God's dwelling place is the center and reality of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose in this universe there was no such thing as a collective people; that is, there was no such thing as those who are God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If this were the situation, there would be no dwelling place of God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without God's people as His dwelling place, the universe would be empty and vain, without a center and without reality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we need to see that the center and reality of the universe is God's dwelling place among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A MUTUAL ABODE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The tabernacle as God's dwelling place is actually a mutual dwelling place, a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This abode is God's dwelling and also the dwelling of God's serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, God dwells in His people, and His people dwell in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means there is a mutual dwelling in a mutual dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a wonderful dwelling place is the center and reality of the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This wonderful dwelling place is not only the center and reality of the universe; it is also the center and reality of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the center and reality of the Old Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the tabernacle, God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is the center and reality of the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is God's house, God's habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The whole Bible is a history of God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This matter is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another crucial matter concerns what is revealed in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Gospel of John reveals the Triune God dispensing Himself into His people and thereby making them His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, God's dwelling place also becomes the dwelling place of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, it is a mutual dwelling place or mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John 15:4 says, "Abide in Me and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This can also be translated, "Dwell in Me and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this verse we see the mutual dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since there is a mutual dwelling, there must certainly be a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This mutual abode is the center and reality of the Gospel of John.</S>
