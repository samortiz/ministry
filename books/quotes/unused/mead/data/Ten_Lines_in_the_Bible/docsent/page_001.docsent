   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible contains sixty-six books written by more than forty people during the course of more than one thousand six hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From man s perspective, its content is broad, profound, intricate, and complicated; those who study the Bible often find it difficult to grasp and thoroughly understand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we know that the Bible actually has only one Author God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The entire Bible is inspired by God; it is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So if we have revelation from the Holy Spirit, we will see that the subjects in the Bible are presented in consistent lines from the beginning to the end. In order to know the Bible in a thorough way, we must find the subjects of these lines.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During a training in Taipei, Taiwan, Witness Lee uncovered ten major lines in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who desire to know the Bible should have a clear understanding of all ten lines, which are a golden key to open the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With such a key we will be able to more easily enter into the depths of the Bible in order to touch its real essence.</S>
