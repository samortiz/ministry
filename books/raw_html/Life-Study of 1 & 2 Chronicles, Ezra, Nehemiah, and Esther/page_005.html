<h2 class="head1">GOD DOING THE WORK OF TRANSFORMATION<br />
WITH PATIENCE</h2>
<p>Although we are God&rsquo;s reproduction, this reproduction&mdash; God&rsquo;s hobby&mdash;is not so complete or perfect, because many of us who have God&rsquo;s life do not live by His life. Some do live by God&rsquo;s life, but they do not live by His life continually. Perhaps in the morning they live by God&rsquo;s life, but later in the day they may lose their temper and live like a scorpion. This means that in the morning they are gods, but later they are &ldquo;scorpions.&rdquo; In the evening they may become even worse, living like the devil, Satan. It is not too much to say that a believer in Christ can live like Satan. One day the Lord Jesus turned to Peter, someone who loved Him, and said to him, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan!&rdquo; (Matt. 16:23a). Because Peter had become Satan, he needed to bear his cross so that Satan could be put on the cross.</p>
<p>In our daily living we may be God at one time, a scorpion at another time, and Satan at yet another time. Because this is our actual situation, we surely need to be transformed. Do you know what our God is doing today? God is doing the work of transformation in us with patience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REVOLUTIONIZED BY REALIZING WHO WE ARE</h2>
<p>Since the ministry began in the United States in 1962, I have actually ministered only one matter&mdash;God becoming a man that man may become God in life and in nature. However, it was not until February 1994 that I received such a clear view with a heavy burden to tell God&rsquo;s people that we all are God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</p>
<p>To know who we are and to realize who we are revolutionizes us. Suppose a certain brother who has been living like a scorpion realizes that, as a child of God, he is God in life and in nature. Immediately this brother will be radically changed. The atmosphere and everything related to him will also be changed. If all of today&rsquo;s Christians realized that they were God in life and in nature, the whole world would be different.</p>
<p>During the past ten months, I have often checked with myself: &ldquo;Is a God-man like this? You have spoken that the believers have become God in life and in nature, yet what are you now? Are you God or are you something else?&rdquo; My answer has been to repent and ask for the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness because at least some of the things I did were not in Him or according to Him. This realization has revolutionized me.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STALENESS OF FUNDAMENTAL CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>On the one hand, outwardly God as the Ruler of the universe has done many things so that people from everywhere in the world can be blended. On the other hand, God has a recovery on earth, and His recovery has been under His leading for seventy-two years. During these years He has released thousands of printed messages, and these messages are in thousands of homes. These messages have been received in many countries around the world. On a regular basis I receive letters of appreciation. Recently someone wrote to me saying that he had been listening to lies about us, but when he read the <em>Life-study of Galatians,</em>his eyes were opened and he could see the truth. Such publications have reached many nations, and we believe that the Lord will use them to gain what He desires.</p>
<p>Christianity has been on earth for more than nineteen centuries. It has kept and continues to teach the fundamental faith. But its fundamental faith has not reached the peak of the divine revelation&mdash;that God became a man through incarnation and then passed through human living, death, and resurrection in order to have a mass reproduction of Himself. Because fundamental Christianity has not reached this peak, the fundamental teachings have become stale. As a result, many in the denominations do not have a goal, and they do not know where they should go. Even many leading ones in today&rsquo;s Christianity do not know how to go on; they have nowhere to go. Visit the Christian bookstores and see what kind of books are being sold there. Many books are filled with old, stale fundamental teachings.</p>
<p>Because fundamental Christianity has become stale, it has lost its impact and effect, like salt which has become tasteless (Matt. 5:13). Who is the salt among the Christians in the United States? Salt is supposed to kill corruption, but where is this killing power among today&rsquo;s Christians? In most communities it is hard to tell who are Christians and who are not Christians. All the people are about the same.</p>
