   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 5 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 John 2:15-17 Do not love the world nor the things in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him; because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father but is of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And the world is passing away, and its lust, but he who does the will of God abides forever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eph 2:2 You once walked according to the age of this world</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Formation of the World</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the creation of man, there were only the universe, the heaven and earth, and all things; the world did not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The world was formed after the fall when man became independent of God and forfeited His care.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, in studying the formation of the world, we must first consider the daily requirements of man's existence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible divides man's needs into three main categories: provision, protection, and pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to maintain his existence, he needs not only the various provisions, such as clothing, food, etc., but also a means of defense to protect himself from being hurt and a form of amusement for his happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the beginning these three great needs supply, defense, and amusement were planned and prepared by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Adam in the garden of Eden had no need to worry, plan, or prepare anything for himself, for God was responsible for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since God supplied all man's needs, then in reality God was his life and his all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he lost God, man naturally lost God's provision, protection, and pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When man lost God's care for his livelihood he feared poverty, danger, and boredom with life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, in order to meet the necessities of life and survive, man used his own strength and devised means of supply, defense, and amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From this time, man created a godless civilization.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When mankind lived a godless life, Satan immediately disguised himself and utilized these three avenues as a means to possess man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later, Satan organized these into a more tangible and systematized world, thus entangling mankind in a tighter web.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Definition of the World</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Originally, man belonged to God, lived by God, and relied entirely upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now Satan has systematized the world to replace God in providing for man's need.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the world consists of everything that replaces God and all that usurps man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When people, activities, or things whether good or bad, beautiful or ugly enslave man, they comprise the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Anything that causes man to disregard God, be removed from Him, or be independent of Him is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Greek word for world is kosmos, which means system or organization.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The world denotes the enemy's scheme, system, and organization to usurp the place of God in man and finally to gain full possession of man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Concerning the definition of the world, the Bible gives some explanations: First, the difference between the world and the things in the world 1 John 2:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here the things in the world contradict the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All that does not come from the Father, all that originates outside of God, and all that comes from the world are things of the world and are contrary to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, the difference between the world and the age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>106 In Ephesians 2:2 this world refers to the satanic system, which is composed of many ages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the age here refers to a part, a section, an aspect, the present and modern appearance, of the system of Satan, which is used by him to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>107 So, age means the world which is revealed before us today, or the things in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Romans 12:2, the age, not the world, is in opposition to the will of God; this corresponds to 1 John 2:17.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, we see that the world is in opposition to God, and the age or the things in the world are in opposition to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>108</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
