<h2 class="head2">Submission to Authority<br />Being Submission to the Head</h2><p>Authority is the deputy of the Head. When the eyes see, it is actually not the eyes that are seeing but the head that sees. When the limbs move, they are not the ones that are moving, but the head that is moving. All the movements of the body are headed up by the head. What is ministry? Ministry is the movement of the Head. Whenever we are at odds with the ministry, we are at odds with the Head. In the Bible the overwhelming majority of authorities are deputy authorities. When we speak about submission to authority, we mean submission to deputy authorities. The real manifestation of authority is the expression of the Head. Submitting to authority is submitting to the Head. For this reason, God's children should learn submission.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting the Ministry<br />Rather Than Repeating the Ministry</h2><p>Ministry is expressed in two things: gift and authority. The gift is the power of the ministry. It is also the expression of authority. A man cannot accept the gift while rejecting the authority. For example, on the one hand, the eyes have the gift of seeing. On the other hand, they have the authority, and other members have to accept them. If other members do not accept the eyes, they will not receive the supply of their gift. As long as you are a member of the Body, you have to accept the gifts of the other members. There is no need for you to repeat their gifts. Concerning the ministry, there is only the question of accepting; there is no need of repeating. What we have to do today is not a matter of repeating others' ministries, like duplicating with carbon paper. All we have to do is to accept.</p><p>We should always remember that we are only a member; we are not the whole Body. No one is all-inclusive. If a person is all-inclusive, he is no longer a member. The parts of a car are only the parts; they are not the whole. The parts cannot equal the whole car.</p><h2 class="head2">Every Member Enjoying<br />the Riches of the Body</h2><p>Although I am only a member, I can share the riches of the Body. Every member in the Body shares the riches of the Body. My fingers never complain that they cannot see. My ears never complain that they cannot walk. They never say, "Why can we not walk like the feet?'' The many gifts in the Body are there to perfect the saints. This is why there is no division in the Body, and there are no conflicting ideologies. Although the position of the hand dictates that it cannot be the speaking member, the hand is satisfied as long as the mouth can speak. The mouth speaking is the same as the hand speaking. The life that we received is a partial life; it is not the whole life. When we experience the riches of the other members in this way, the Body is perfected. Under these circumstances, how can the individual members be poor, and how can they be useless?</p><h2 class="head2">Coordination Dealing with the Self</h2><p>Many people think that what they have is theirs, and that what others have is not theirs. However, we have to realize that individualism is the worst thing in the Body. In the Body of Christ individualism must be removed. The greatest test to the self is in the meetings, in the church, and among the brothers and sisters. On the one hand, we have to see that we are members individually. On the other hand, we have to see that we are a Body together with many other members. It is easy to deal with unbelievers. As soon as they walk through the door, they realize that they have the wrong address and have stumbled into the wrong place. But it is not so easy to deal with individualism. Individualism often creeps into the church without one realizing it. It is when a person is being coordinated together that his self is most severely dealt with. The minute a man lives in coordination, his self is dealt with.</p>
