Lord, we are all here waiting on You. Lord, thank You that You have opened up Your Word in these days to us. We need Your Spirit, the Spirit of grace, and even the Spirit of supplication, that we may pray to You to receive Yourself as our grace. Lord, tonight we look unto You for a living revelation. Unveil Yourself to us and expose us. Lord, we want to know You. In the light of knowing You, we want to see ourselves. Lord Jesus, we want to be adjusted once more. O Lord, we like to be remodeled. Transform us in the view concerning Your Body, Your church, which is Your heart's desire. Lord, we want to know You in this desire&#151;not in our thinking, in our interest, but in what You want. Lord, do speak to us. Lord, quiet us and give us a heart which is open to You.</P><P>We want to see what You want us to do and to be in these last, crucial days. Lord, we pray for Your move to Europe, even to eastern Europe. We pray for Your step, which includes us. Deeply work in us that we may cooperate with You to go together with You. O Lord Jesus, be the Angel of Jehovah to escort us to Europe&#151;to eastern Germany and to Russia&#151;that You would have a people to carry out Your plan even today. Lord, cover us. We hide ourselves in You and hide ourselves under the cleansing of Your precious blood, the prevailing blood, which protects us against all the enemy's devices. Lord, rebuke him as You did before Joshua. We need Your cleansing; we even need Your purification. O Lord Jesus, we do not trust in what we can say or in what we can do. We still trust in Your mercy. Lord, grant us Your rich blessing. Lord, we like these three names in Zechariah 1:1&#151;at an appointed time [Iddo] Jehovah will bless [Berechiah] and Jehovah will remember [Zechariah]. Lord, we believe this is the appointed time. Lord, bless us and remember us. Lord Jesus, we put our full trust in You. We have absolutely no trust in ourselves. Amen.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Further Consideration of the Eldership, the Region of Work, and the Care for the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
