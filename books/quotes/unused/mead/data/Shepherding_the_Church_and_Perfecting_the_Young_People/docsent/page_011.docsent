   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Saints Having Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but Not Being Independent</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Elders should shepherd and oversee the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders should entrust the services to the saints and give them the authority to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, this does not mean that the saints are independent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose there are eight districts in a church, and the elders delegate the church affairs to the eight districts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This does not mean that the districts are independent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same way, the saints are in different districts and in small groups, but they are still the one church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The function of the elders is to oversee the church, not to lord it over their allotments 1 Pet 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The elders should shepherd the saints, delegating services to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then they should oversee the saints, letting the saints have authority for their service and allowing them to develop.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the church in Taipei some halls have very capable saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the saints are not developed, because there is not much shepherding and overseeing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Directing the saints is not the same as overseeing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we direct others, we have not handed things over to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To hand things over means to entrust.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, if a brother is given the responsibility to purchase a tape recorder, he will need to pray earnestly even concerning the money to make the purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He must also consider the size and type of tape recorder.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning the finances, the size, and the type, he and those who coordinate with him must go before the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The service for recording the meetings is a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The key to the recording room should not be in the pocket of the elders; it should be given to a serving one who manages everything related to the recording room.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If he is careless and leaves the tape recorder in the elders room, they can remind him to put it away.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he is careless in other matters, the elders should pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he loses the tape recorder, he will surely learn a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not a joke.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way many saints will be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some elders have argued that the co-workers are serving very faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I know the co-workers are faithful and have a good intention.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, their faithfulness and good intention annul the function of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After working in a place for two years, the co-workers and elders should not be tied down, and the saints should be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must change our concept and raise up the saints by handing things over to them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must not be fearful of their mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I handed over the responsibility of a conference to the young saints in Los Angeles and told them that making mistakes is the way to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The most precious thing in our work is to produce useful saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE WORK OF THE CO-WORKERS The Co-workers Bringing Forth Useful Saints</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must change our system.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once our concept is changed, it will be easy to change our system.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The work of shepherding and feeding in the church desperately requires the time and energy of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They should be like parents endeavoring to feed their children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The work has decided to move the co-workers out of the localities, but we are worried about the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The churches have relied too heavily on the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After working in a local church for three years, a co-worker should be able to leave, because he should have raised up useful saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, our practice has not been to develop the saints but to replace them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more the co-workers have labored, the more responsibilities they have gained, but other saints were not brought in to function.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a co-worker arrives in a local church, he does not have much responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But after three years all the responsibilities in the church are on his shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He does everything, while the other saints do nothing; they merely listen to his instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result, no responsibilities are handed over to the saints, and the saints are not raised up to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the end the co-worker cannot leave the church, because if he leaves, the church will lose its support.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The co-worker has become the only pillar in the house, and when the pillar is removed, the house collapses.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A laboring co-worker is a pillar, but he should gradually add other pillars to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When there are fifteen pillars in a local church, it is time for the co-worker to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the principle of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In a training in 1953 I said that a co-worker should lead the saints, but under no circumstance should he replace them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, in the churches that I have visited, the element of replacing the saints still remains among us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is greater than the element of leading.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The co-workers have been serving in place of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They keep things in their hands and direct others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If this situation continues, the saints in the localities will not know what to do when the co-workers leave.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The more we work, the more the saints should be raised up to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 1946 I was led by the Lord to go to Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In my first fellowship with the brothers, I said, You brothers are happy that I am here, and you think that I have come to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, I want to warn you that while I am here, your responsibilities will not decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am very burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everyday a part of my burden will be transferred to you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After a year I will be free of my burden, and all the burden will be yours.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, I have not come to replace you; rather, I have come to burden you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In less than two years all the responsibilities in the church in Nanking were borne fully by the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They took care of everything.</S>
