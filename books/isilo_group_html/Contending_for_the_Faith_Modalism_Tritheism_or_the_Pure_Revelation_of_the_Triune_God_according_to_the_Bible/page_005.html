However, studying the Scriptures in order to carry on the contest with greater accuracy, he himself was caught by the Spirit. His statements on the Triune God reflect the simplicity of the pure Word. He said:<p>The one ambition that urges us Christians on is the desire to know the true God and the Word that is from Him-what is the unity of the Son with the Father, what is the fellowship of the Father with the Son, what is the Spirit; what is the unity of these mighty Powers; and the distinction that exists between them, united as they are-the Spirit, the Son, the Father.<sup>48</sup><p>Commenting on what Athenagoras wrote, Bishop Bull indicates that he was charged both with Sabellianism and Arianism:<p>And hence it is that Petavius [a French Jesuit scholar A.D. 1583-1652] at last charges Athenagoras with Sabellianism, as if he had believed that there is, and ever has been but one Person of the Father and the Son. This, I repeat, Petavius does, the very same one who both in the very passage in which he does it and elsewhere throughout, introduces the same Athenagoras as being an Arian; thus fixing on the learned father two heresies which are diametrically opposed to each other.<sup>49</sup><p>The word homoousios that was introduced into the Nicene Creed was misused and abused by some to favor Sabellianism and utilized by others who favored tritheism.<sup>50</sup> Commenting on the problem surrounding the use of this word, the church historian Socrates Scholasticus (A.D. 379-445?) said:<p>...while they [the bishops] occupied themselves in too minute investigation of its import, they roused the strife against each other; it seemed not unlike a contest in the dark; for neither party appeared to understand distinctly the grounds on which they calumniated one another. Those who objected to the word homoousios, conceived that those who approved it favored the opinion of Sabellius and Montanus; they therefore called them blasphemers, as subverting the existence of the Son of God. And again the advocates of this term, charging their opponents with polytheism, inveighed against them as introducers of heathen superstitions....In consequence of these misunderstandings, each of them wrote as if contending against adversaries: and although it was admitted on both sides that the Son of God has a distinct person and existence, and all acknowledged that there is one God in three Persons, yet from what cause I am unable to divine, they could not agree among themselves, and therefore could in no way endure to be at peace.<sup>51</sup><p>Eventually, the Fathers developed what is known as the doctrine of co-inherence, which means the intercommunion and interpenetration of the Persons of the Godhead. Co-inherence denotes the mutual indwelling of the three Persons whereby one is as invariably in the other two as they are in the one.<sup>52</sup> This doctrine is man&#8217;s attempt to understand the relationship between the three Persons and to explain how they have one essence. As John of Damascus said in his Exposition of the Orthodox Faith &#8220;...the Son is in the Father and the Spirit: and the Spirit in the Father and the Son: and the Father in the Son and the Spirit, but there is no coalescence or co-mingling or confusion.&#8221;<sup>53</sup> Commenting on this matter, Augustus H. Strong remarks, &#8220;The Scripture representations of this intercommunion prevent us from conceiving of the distinctions called Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as involving separation between them. This intercommunion also explains the designation of Christ as &#8216;the Spirit,&#8217; and of the Spirit as &#8216;the Spirit of Christ.&#8217;&#8221;<sup>54</sup> On the same page, Strong quotes another writer as saying, &#8220;The persons of the Holy Trinity are not separable individuals. Each involves the others; the coming of each is the coming of the others. Thus the coming of the Spirit must have involved the coming of the Son.&#8221;<sup>55</sup><p>In his classic work, Defense of the Nicene Creed, Bishop Bull says, &#8220;The co-inherence [mutual indwelling] of the Divine Persons is indeed a very great mystery, which we ought rather religiously to adore than curiously pry into.... It is a union which far transcends all other unions.&#8221;<sup>56</sup> The doctrine of co-inherence, therefore, was an explanation of the Persons of the Trinity that guarded the three Persons from dissolving into modalism&#8217;s three phases, stages, or aspects of God and also protected the three Persons from ending up as three Gods.<sup>57</sup><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Contending for the Faith: Modalism, Tritheism, or the Pure Revelation of the Triune God according to the Bible &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
