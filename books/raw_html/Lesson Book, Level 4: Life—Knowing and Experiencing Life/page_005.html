<h1 class=msg>Lesson Two</h1><h1 class=msg>LIFE BEING GOD HIMSELF</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>John 14:6; 1 Tim. 3:16; John 1:4; 10:10; Col. 3:4; John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Life being God Himself</li><li>Life being Christ</li><li>Life being the Holy Spirit</li><li>Life being God the Father in the Son as the Spirit flowing into us</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><h2 class=head1>I. LIFE BEING GOD HIMSELF</h2><p>As a result of regeneration we all have this life and we must thank and praise Him for giving us this life. However, we must explore further to better understand this life, so that our experience will be correct and enriched. We must see that life is not something that is merely of God or that is given by God, but that it is God Himself.<p>[In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus says that He is life. After He said this, from verse 7 to 11, He made known to the disciples that He and God are one—and when He speaks this word, it is God speaking in Him. He is God become flesh; and He is God in the flesh (John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim. 3:16). When He says He is life, it is God who says God is life. Hence His words show us that life is the very God Himself.<p>Strictly speaking, when we receive life, we receive not the life of God, but God as life. Not only did God give us His life; He Himself came to be our life. Because God Himself is life, His life is His very self.<p>Then what is life? Life is God Himself; What does it mean to have life? To have life is to have God Himself. What does it mean to live out life? To live out life is to live out God Himself. Life is not different in the least from God. If it were, then it would not be life. We should understand this clearly. It is not sufficient merely to know that we have life; we must know further that this life we have is God Himself. It is not sufficient only to know that we should live out life; we must also know that the life we should live out is God Himself.]<p>God is love. God is light. God is holy. God is righteous. When we have God as our life, we may live out God and express Him as love, light, holiness and righteousness. When we have God as our life we would not hate our enemies, rather we would love them (Matt. 5:44). We would not walk in darkness and do the hidden things of shame (2 Cor. 4:2); rather we would walk in the light as He is in the light (1 John 1:7). We would not be worldly, but rather would be holy, separated from the world and full of God’s holy nature (2 Pet. 1:4; 1 Thes. 5:23). We would not be unrighteous, but rather we would become the righteousness of God (2 Cor. 5:21). This is too marvelous. God can be life in us to live out all that God is.
