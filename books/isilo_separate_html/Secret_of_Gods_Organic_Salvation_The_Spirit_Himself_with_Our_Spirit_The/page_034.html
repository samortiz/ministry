Union with the World</h2><p>The believers need to be saved also from the worldliness in union with the world as a marriage and the teaching of Balaam and the Nicolaitans in the church in Pergamos (vv. 12-17).</p><h2 class="head4">d. Fornication, Idolatry, and Demonic Teaching</h2><p>Next, the sevenfold intensified Spirit saves the believers from the fornication, idolatry, demonic teaching, and satanic depths in Catholicism, signified by the church in Thyatira (vv. 18-29). In the Catholic Church today, there are many demonic teachings, for example, the teaching that one&rsquo;s prayers can shorten the time that someone else will spend in purgatory. Even though the Catholic Church correctly teaches certain things regarding God, Christ, and redemption, this teaching has been &ldquo;leavened&rdquo; by being mixed with pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters. Many of these are enumerated in the book entitled <i>The Two Babylons.</i></p><h2 class="head4">e. Spiritual Death</h2><p>Furthermore, the believers need to be saved from the spiritual death&mdash;from being dead and dying&mdash;in Protestantism, signified by the church in Sardis (3:1-6). Spiritual death is prevailing in today&rsquo;s Protestantism. Some in the denominations are quite good, but the majority are either dead or dying.</p><h2 class="head4">f. Losing the Crown</h2><p>Next, the believers need to be saved from the losing of the crown, which has been gained already in Brethrenism, signified by the church in Philadelphia (vv. 7-13). <i>Philadelphia</i> means &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo; Some in Brethrenism had gained the crown but eventually were defeated and were in danger of losing the crown at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. Thus, the Lord warned them, saying, &ldquo;Hold fast what you have that no one take your crown&rdquo; (v. 11).</p><h2 class="head4">g. Lukewarmness and Christlessness</h2><p>Finally, Christ as the sevenfold intensified Spirit saves the believers from the lukewarmness and the Christlessness in degraded Brethrenism, signified by the church in Laodicea (vv. 14-22). We know that the church in Laodicea was Christless by the fact that He was outside the church, standing at the door and knocking (v. 20). This indicates that we may have Christ in name but not in reality. We need to be careful lest this become our situation today. We all should consider these matters not for others but for ourselves.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Means by Which the Believers<br />Are Saved from Degradation</h2><p>Now we need to see the means by which the believers are saved from the degradation of the church.</p><h2 class="head4">a. The Speaking of the Pneumatic Christ</h2><p>Christ saves us from degradation by His speaking. In Revelation 2 and 3 the speaking of the unlimited life-releasing sevenfold intensified pneumatic Christ to the seven churches at the beginning of each epistle respectively becomes the speaking of the sevenfold intensified, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit to all the seven churches at the end of each epistle universally (2:1, 7, 8, 11, 12, 17, 18, 29; 3:1, 6, 7, 13, 14, 22). At the beginning of each of the seven epistles, it is Christ who is speaking, but at the end of each epistle it is the Spirit who is speaking. The speaking of Christ therefore becomes the speaking of the Spirit. From this we see that Christ&rsquo;s speaking and the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking are one speaking. Christ speaks to a particular local church, and the Spirit speaks to the universal Body. By this speaking Christ saves us from the degradation of today&rsquo;s church.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Participation of the Overcoming Saints</h2><p>Christ saves the believers also by the participation of the overcoming saints who are living in their spirit drawn by the Lamb (1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10; 14:4). Christ and the Spirit speak, and the overcoming saints respond and say yes to the Lord. The believers who respond in this way will be saved.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> </body></html>
