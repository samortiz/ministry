   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RAISING UP GROUP MEETINGS IN THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The group meetings should be eighty percent of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we do not build up the group meetings, the church will be very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Among us there are some older saints who love the Lord and the church but do not have the habit of attending the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have the habit only of coming to the Lord s table meeting, the ministry meeting, and sometimes the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some may come only to take the Lord s table on the Lord s Day and leave an offering in the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To charge, encourage, and exhort them to come to the group meetings will not work since they do not have such a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, some of the older saints do have the burden to come to the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many of them, though, have been in the traditional, old way for years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their traditional way of meeting may be compared to speaking English with a foreign accent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because of my old, traditional background, my English is somewhat poor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is difficult for me to get rid of my old way of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, it is difficult to drop the traditional way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These older saints with the traditional ways will eventually be in the same group meetings as the newly baptized ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way to build up the group meetings, therefore, is first by going out to gain new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is best not to raise up a group meeting with the older saints as the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should first go to gain new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After one or two new ones are gained, we should go to their home to feed them in their home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This home meeting will become a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we may invite some older saints to join us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way we will have a mixed attendance with some new ones and some older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must let the new ones know that we do not care as much for the big meetings as we care for the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The group meetings are the lifeline, the pulse, of our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the same time we should have a thorough fellowship with the older saints in the group, either in our home or in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can tell them that they should forget about the old way of meeting and that they need to pick up the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the first few group meetings, we need to explain what the new way is and how to have a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should explain that we come together not in formality, but in a released spirit to fellowship, pray, care for one another, and shepherd one another.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though our current group meetings may have the element of oldness, we should not dissolve them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will not be good for the attendants in those meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We still need to maintain the present meetings, but at the same time we should form a group in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our time and energy should be concentrated on the new group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If some saints would raise up group meetings in the new way, after a few months many others will follow them to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At that time the meetings in the older way will fade away by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not depend upon the church to arrange a group meeting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we want a family, we should simply get married and bring forth children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not need to wait for our parents to arrange a family for us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>An arranged family is not a genuine family.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to produce the group meetings ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we must learn the new way to have the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not sufficient to maintain a number of home meetings with only two or three members present.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These smaller meetings will not be as effective as the group meetings and will not last for the long term.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to go along with the need of the new ones, but in going along with their need, we must bring them into the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then a proper, genuine group meeting will be built up with them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A group meeting formed and built up in a proper, spiritual way will endure for the long term.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church life depends upon this kind of group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to learn the best way to have the group meetings, and we need to spend time to labor according to what we have learned.</S>
