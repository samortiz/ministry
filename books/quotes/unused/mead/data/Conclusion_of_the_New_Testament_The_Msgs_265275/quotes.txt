[2]  In the foregoing messages of The Conclusion of the New Testament, we covered seven persons: God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem.
[3]  Beginning with this message, we will consider another matter Christ as our experience, enjoyment, and expression.
[4]  Christ, the Son of Abraham, brings us the divine blessing for us to inherit God.
[5]  Abraham's seed is only one, Christ v. 16 . Hence to be Abraham's seed we must be Christ's, a part of Christ.
[6]  If we study the history in the Old Testament, we will see that after God made the covenant with Abraham, His people had failure after failure and defeat after defeat.
[7]  The blessing could not come because the earth was full of rebellion against God.
[8]  Therefore, God came to a man according to His heart 1 Sam 13:14 , David, the son of Jesse, and made a covenant with him 2 Sam 7:12-17 .
[9]  God must have a kingdom, a realm, a sphere, on earth with His chosen race to exercise His administration under His full, divine authority.
[10]  In the previous message we saw that the Lord Jesus is the Son of David and the Son of Abraham.
[11]  The title Christ is emphasized in Matthew 1:16 to prove that Jesus is the very Christ, the Messiah, prophesied in the Old Testament. a. God's Anointed Messiah
[12]  We may also experience and enjoy Christ as Emmanuel.
[13]  " Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel,' which is translated, God with us " Matt 1:23 .
[14]  In His human living the Lord Jesus was a despised Nazarene.
[15]  a. The Embodiment and Expression of the Triune God
[16]  We may experience and enjoy Christ not only as God but also as a man the Son of Man Matt 4:4; 19:28; 26:64; 24:37, 39, 44 .
[17]  It seems that it is easier for us to experience Christ as God than as a man. a. In His Humanity
[18]  As the Son of Man, Christ has all the virtues of humanity Psa 45:2a .
[19]  In Him we see all the attributes of God and all the human virtues, for His constitution is a composition of the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues.
[20]  In Matthew 4:23-24, we see that Christ is also the Healer.
[21]  When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He taught as One having authority Matt 7:28-29 .
[22]  Mark 1:22 says, "They were astounded at His teaching, for He taught them as One having authority and not like the scribes."
[23]  But the Lord Jesus, as the God-authorized Teacher, teaching realities by God, had not only spiritual power to subdue people but also divine authority to subject them to the divine ruling. b.
[24]  In this message we will cover further aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the Gospel of Matthew.
[25]  All these aspects are related to experiencing and enjoying Christ as the most pleasant person.
[26]  As the Physician, the Lord Jesus is not for the righteous but for sinners.
[27]  Christ as the unshrunk cloth is not for patching an old garment.
[28]  The One with Heavenly-ruled Deeds the Fringe of His Garment
[29]  "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest" v. 28 . Here the Lord Jesus sounds out a call to come to Him for rest from being burdened to toil.
[30]  Christ is the One greater than the temple for feeding His followers.
[31]  When the Pharisees criticized the Lord's disciples for picking ears of grain on the Sabbath, He said, "Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, and those who were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, except for the priests only?" vv.
[32]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS 6 26.
[33]  In Matthew 12:18-21 we see Christ as the Servant of Jehovah.
[34]  "In His name will the Gentiles hope" v. 21 . Due to the rejection by the Jewish religionists, the Servant of Jehovah, with His salvation, turned to the Gentiles.
[35]  Now the Gentiles put their hope in His name, believing in Him and receiving Him as their Savior.
[36]  As the One greater than Solomon, Christ speaks the word of wisdom today.
[37]  By sowing Himself as the seed of life into us, Christ makes us the wheat of life v. 30b . As the wheat of life we are the many grains produced by Christ John 12:24 . The Triune God in His embodiment has been sown into our being to grow wheat, producing the many grains that can be blended together to be one entity, the one Body of Christ 1 Cor 10:17 . This thought is high, deep, and profound.
[38]  In Matthew 14:22-33 Christ is presented to us as the Escort in the way of following Him.
[39]  In Matthew 15:22-28 Christ is revealed as the crumbs, the fragments of bread, under the table. a. Despised and Rejected by the Children the Children of Israel
[40]  The Son of the Living God Referring to His Person for the Producing of the Many Sons of God to Be Members of the Church
[41]  Whereas Christ is the title of the Lord according to His commission, the Son of the living God is His title according to His person.
[42]  Immediately after Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said, "I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church" v. 18a . This rock refers not only to Christ Himself but also to the revelation of the Christ and the Son of the living God which Peter received from the Father.
[43]  To deny our self is to forfeit our soul-life, our natural life Matt 16:26; Luke 9:25 .
[44]  In Matthew 17:24-26 Christ is revealed as the Son of God.
[45]  To this question Peter said, "Yes" v. 25a . The temple tax was a Jewish poll tax for the temple, equal to half a shekel Exo 30:12-16; 38:26 . Peter had received the revelation concerning Christ's being the Son of God Matt 16:16-17 , and he had seen the vision of the Son of God 17:5 . But here, in application, he was put to the test by the temple-tax gatherers' question.
[46]  The Lord Jesus Christ is the One into whose name the believers are gathered together.
[47]  The Lord Jesus gathers us not in His name but into His name.
[48]  Matthew 21:9 says, "The crowds who went before Him and those who followed cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David!
[49]  Often the Lord desired to gather the children of Jerusalem together, but they were not willing.
[50]  The Christ revealed in the entire book of Matthew is the center of the processed Triune God 28:19 .
[51]  In the opening chapter of Matthew, the Holy Spirit v. 18 , Christ the Son v. 18 , and God the Father v. 23 are upon the scene for the producing of the man Jesus v. 21 , who, as Jehovah the Savior and God with us, is the embodiment of the Triune God.
[52]  In chapter twelve the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father v. 28 . In chapter sixteen the Son is revealed by the Father to the disciples for the building of the church, which is the life pulse of the kingdom vv.
[53]  In chapter seventeen the Son entered into transfiguration v. 2 and was confirmed by the Father's word of delight v. 5 for a miniature display of the manifestation of the kingdom 16:28 . Eventually, in the closing chapter, after Christ, as the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45b , had passed through the process of crucifixion, entered into resurrection, and become the life-giving Spirit, He came back to His disciples, in the atmosphere and reality of His resurrection, to charge them to make the heathen the kingdom people by baptizing them into the name, the person, the reality, of the Divine Trinity.
[54]  For the Disciples to Baptize People into the Processed Triune God by Baptizing Them into Him
[55]  In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus charged His disciples, saying, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[56]  This indicates that baptizing people into the name of the Lord Jesus is equal to baptizing them into the name of the Triune God, for Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God and even the center of the processed Triune God.
[57]  In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Luke.
[58]  Luke 2:32 tells us that Christ is light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of God's people Israel. a. A Light for Revelation to the Gentiles
[59]  As the best robe, Christ is our righteousness for us to be justified by God outwardly.
[60]  a. As the Seed of the Kingdom of God Sown into the Believers to Develop into God's Kingdom
[61]  The fourth chapter of the Gospel of Mark reveals that Christ is the seed of the kingdom of God sown into the believers to develop into God's kingdom.
[62]  The sower here signifies the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, who came to sow Himself as the seed of life in His word v. 14 into men's hearts that He might grow and live in them and be expressed from within them.
[63]  a. For the Believers to Receive through Repentance for Forgiveness of Sins
[64]  Verse 47 says, "That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name."
[65]  This verse indicates that Christ as the One prophesied in the Old Testament is for the believers to receive through repentance for forgiveness of sins. b.
[66]  In verse 46 the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day."
