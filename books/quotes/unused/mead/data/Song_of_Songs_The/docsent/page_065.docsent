   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The maiden brings up those whom she has always cared for and who are younger than she is; she brings them up before the Lord to discuss them with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because she is living so much in the Lord's will, she can say, "We have ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She knows that her concern is the Lord's concern.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, she says, "We."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She knows that what she wants is also what the Lord wants.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, she says, "We."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The union is complete; there is no more separation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, prayers are no longer requests, but a speaking forth of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 9 says, "If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"If she be a wall."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there is anything that is of God, which causes her to build a separation between herself and that which is not of God, like a wall, then "we will build upon her a palace of silver."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will build upon her everything that is high and noble that comes from redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If she has established a life of separation through the Holy Spirit, we will build upon her the fruit of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If she is a door, others will enter into God's knowledge through her.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"We will inclose her with boards of cedar."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will add Christ's heavenly humanity to her.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Wood signifies humanity, whereas cedar is tall.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence cedar wood signifies Christ's heavenly humanity, His glorified humanity, and His heavenly human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She no longer does the things that she wants to do; she does them together with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the words are out of her mouth, they represent the Lord's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 10 says, "I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"I am a wall."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am already a separated person; the Lord has separated me from everything unclean, common, and ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"My breasts like towers."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My faith and love are based on my separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord has established me, and my two breasts are no longer undeveloped; they are like towers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have come to the point where I am a person who has obtained peace in His eyes "found favor" can be translated "found peace" .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that I can be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, a life of peace is based on a life of separation, which is based on the development of faith and love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She gives a short testimony and shows that there is no thought of self-contentment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She can say that she is a wall, and she can say that her two breasts are towers, but in the Lord's eyes, she considers herself as one who has obtained peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 11 says, "Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before the believers are raptured, the Holy Spirit wants them to pay attention to one thing the reward of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Solomon has his vineyards; they are his fields, and he leases them out to the keepers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord's work is not ours; our position is forever that of a steward.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are merely keeping watch over His business.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When He comes, what He entrusted to us will return to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"Baalhamon" means "the lord of all."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows us that the Lord, like Solomon, is the lord of everything; He is also our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Solomon's charge was that the keepers would have the fruits; but for the fruits that they harvested, they would have to give Solomon a thousand pieces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord will also give us the fruit of what we keep, tend, and raise for Him today; that will be our reward.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nothing that we do for the Lord is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even a cup of water that we give away will be rewarded.</S>
