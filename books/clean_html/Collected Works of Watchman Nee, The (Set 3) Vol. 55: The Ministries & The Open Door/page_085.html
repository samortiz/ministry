<h2 class="head2">Recent News from Foochow and Kuling</h2><p>Brother Guang-tao is here and is still able to mingle with the brothers in the service. We spend most of the time in physical labor. He washes clothes himself and cleans the house, which seems to be good for him. We feel that we need his portion in many matters.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Peace Wang<br />July 17</p><p>The brothers at Kuling have hope for their harvest if there is one more month without a typhoon. Their difficulties in making a living would then be solved. There are not many elderly, weak, or sick ones in the church in Kuling. Most are strong, but without work. There are difficulties in giving aid to them, however: 1) Many are too proud to take it freely. 2) Some are lazy and easily become greedy. We have asked the local responsible brothers to go before the Lord together to find a way. With the exception of those who are sick, we now render help in return for work. We have assigned them to fix up the clinic and the school on the mountain. They have recently volunteered to repair the Ministers' House on Haiguanxiang on the same ground of fellowship. The brothers and sisters living in the Ministers' House had some precious fellowship in the Holy Spirit with brothers living in the neighborhood. Thank God! He has done all things well in this matter!</p><p>All of us together are still doing our best to cultivate the fields and raise rabbits, bees, and pigs, but we are far from making ends meet. (Kuling is too remote, and there is not enough area at Haiguanxiang.) The brothers have made several plans but have not been able to carry them out. We plan to plant flowers for honey at Kuling and are preparing to make honey in large quantities in the future.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Peace Wang<br />July 25</p><p>Mailing Address: Ministers' House, 14 Haiguanxiang, Foochow</p><h2 class="head2">Hoping Only that the Lord<br />Would Have Mercy on Us Again (Nanking)</h2><p>There are many places in northern Kiangsu that only have home meetings. When the brothers went there, they were all prepared to recover the Lord's table. They will recover the other service as the situation allows. They are inwardly burning! More than ten brothers came from northern Kiangsu. They were all responsible brothers in the churches. They stayed in Ningpo for more than twenty days and returned yesterday.</p><p>If the Lord allows, we want group after group of them to come to Ningpo to learn to have fellowship with the churches on the one hand, and to lead them according to the measure of strength given by the Lord on the other hand.</p><p>We can only confess our sin with regard to the churches in northern Kiangsu and cannot say anything more. We have let down the churches, the co-workers, and all the brothers, sisters, and sinners in northern Kiangsu! Our foolish unfaithfulness has been manifested! We only hope that the Lord would have mercy on us so that He would give us the time to repay this debt. We can now only confess our sins and repent; there is nothing else to do! The Lord, however, is giving grace, and He is using Brother Feng Xian-zhi to minister to a group of seekers of the Lord. His spirit has been very strong in the past year, and he has helped many people there. Praise the Lord! He came to Ningpo recently and returned yesterday.</p><p>All the brothers and sisters who bear some responsibility in the church in Nanking are in one accord. Although each has problems with his own disposition, everyone is in one accord for the things of God, and the entire Body has developed such a taste.</p><p>The Lord's Day morning messages alternate between gospel messages and edification messages. Many from the denominations come. Some have taken a turn this way and break bread together with us. Every Monday afternoon for half a day, the responsible ones come together to wait on the saints for fellowship. During these times, there are counselings and prayers. After learning the situation and needs of each one, they help them according to their ability. The result has demonstrated God's blessing.</p><p>There are many brothers and sisters with a heart for the Lord, but their occupation has become a big problem. Some are jobless, and some want to get out of business and into production. There is no practical way to solve their problems. We do not know how to help them.</p><p>Ji Yung-tung<br />January 23, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: Hsin 26 Citanxiang, Zhongshan East Road, Nanking</p>
