   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEEKNESS AND CONSIDERATENESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 10:1 says, "Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and considerateness of Christ" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. This verse does not mean, however, that Paul was imitating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No, because he lived by Christ, Christ's meekness became his.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, he could beseech the Corinthians through the meekness of the Christ by whom he lived.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul was meek, not in himself, but in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whatever he expressed as meekness was Christ's meekness, not his own.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, Paul also besought the Corinthians by the considerateness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Other versions render the Greek word here as "lenience."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that Paul was not legal, but was flexible and lenient.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Like his meekness, his lenience was not of himself; it was of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul experienced Christ as the One who was kind, gentle, and flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because he lived by Christ, Christ's lenience was his.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Paul lived by Christ, he had the virtues of Christ, including the virtues of meekness and considerateness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In his ministry, writing, and speaking, Paul was in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything he did was done by the virtues of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In everything we do we need to be found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Oh, that I may gain Christ and be found in Him in a condition that is based upon faith!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not want to do anything by my struggling or endeavoring.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, I want to do everything by living in Christ that His virtues may be spontaneously expressed in my living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE TRUTH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 2 Corinthians 11:10 Paul says, "The truth of Christ is in me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The truth of Christ was in Paul because Christ Himself was in him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a further proof that Paul lived by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, he could not have had the truth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE GRACE OF CHRIST BEING SUFFICIENT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter twelve Paul prayed three times that the thorn in his flesh would depart from him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 9 says, "And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The power of Christ overshadowed Paul, tabernacling over him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This also is the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul did not do anything on his own, nor did he insist upon his preference.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He simply looked to Christ, trusted in Christ, lived by Christ, and learned to enjoy Christ's overshadowing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To him, Christ was a tabernacle overshadowing him, no matter what difficulties he was experiencing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Under this overshadowing, Paul enjoyed God's sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, little by little and step by step, he came to know Christ, not only by revelation, but through his personal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He could testify and boast that the grace of Christ was sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He knew that when he was weak, he was strong, because in his weakness the power of Christ was made perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the living out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What an experience of Christ the Apostle Paul had!</S>
