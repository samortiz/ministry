   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE PLEDGE OF OUR INHERITANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 1:13 and 14 the seal of the Holy Spirit and the pledge of the Holy Spirit are mentioned together.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is difficult to say which comes first, the sealing or the pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to 2 Corinthians 1:21 and 22, the sealing seems to come first.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second Corinthians 1:22 says that God hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, both the sealing and the pledging actually take place at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE FOURTH ITEM</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>OF GOD S BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The pledging of our inheritance is another aspect of the fourth item of God s well-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sealing of the Spirit is the first aspect of this item of God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>OUR INHERITANCE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need both the sealing and the pledging because in God s work on us two kinds of inheritances are involved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians 1:11 indicates that we were made God s inheritance, and verse 14, that God is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our inheritance is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God s economy we are an inheritance to God, and God is an inheritance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a mutual inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For us to be God s inheritance, we need the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are God s possession, and as our owner, God has put a seal upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because God is our inheritance, we also need the pledging of the Holy Spirit as a guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We shall inherit all that God is, that is, His Person, and all that God has, that is, His work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For such an inheritance, the Holy Spirit is the pledge, the guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BEING THE PLEDGE OF OUR INHERITANCE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Greek word for pledge in verse 14 also means foretaste, guarantee, token payment guaranteeing the full payment, a part payment in advance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since we are God s inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a seal upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a pledge of this inheritance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God gives His Holy Spirit to us, not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In ancient times, the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchase of land.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The seller gave the buyer a sample of the soil from the land being purchased.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, a pledge, according to ancient Greek usage, was also a sample.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Holy Spirit is the sample of what we shall inherit of God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Greek word for pledge is somewhat equal to today s down payment, which indicates good faith and is a guarantee of coming payments.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Pledge, earnest, and guarantee all these words are about the same in meaning, all referring to a payment that guarantees the balance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Greek word in addition signifies a sample, a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some translators prefer the word foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By enjoying the sample we have a foretaste of what is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose someone gives me ten peaches from his peach orchard.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These peaches are a sample and a foretaste of the produce of the whole orchard.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As those who are to inherit God, we have the Holy Spirit as a pledge, guarantee, earnest, and down payment of our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the same time the Holy Spirit is also a sample and a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The foretaste gives us a taste of God; the full taste is yet to come.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 2 Corinthians 1 we have the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Second Corinthians 1:21 says, Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed One, and hath anointed us, is God Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>. The anointing brings the element of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The divine ointment can be compared to paint.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you paint furniture, you apply the element of the paint to the furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Likewise, the anointing puts the divine ointment upon us, and this brings the divine element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more of the anointing we have within, the more of the element of God we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to be coated with the divine ointment again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many of the older brothers and sisters have received hundreds of coatings, but the younger ones have received just a few.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First John 2 says that the anointing abides in us and teaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are taught by being anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Holy Spirit as the compound ointment within us teaches us, not by words, but by painting us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whether we obey His teaching or not, He still anoints us, putting coat after coat upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way the anointing brings the very essence of God into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I praise the Lord that there is a greater dispensation of God Himself today than there was in the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you study the writings of the early church fathers, you will find that their writings cannot compare with what the Lord has shown us in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Which of the church fathers ever said that God is dispensing Himself into our being?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even certain things uttered by the young people today are superior to what was written by the church fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Day by day we are being anointed, and the divine essence is added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After the anointing, 2 Corinthians 1 mentions the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The sealing of the Holy Spirit brings in the image, the appearance, and the expression, for the seal bears the sign, the form.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God is not only anointing us with His essence; He is also sealing us with His appearance, image, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Along with the anointing and the sealing there is the pledging, which is a matter of enjoyment and taste.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Mothers realize that in feeding their children they need to make the food tasteful.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When food is delicious, the children are eager to come to the table at mealtime.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But if the food does not have a pleasant taste, it will be difficult to get the children to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Holy Spirit is within us today as a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If the Spirit were only the anointing and the sealing, we might become bored with the experience of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But we are not tired or bored of the Spirit because the Spirit is also pledging within us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the past I was taught that the pledge of the Holy Spirit was a once-for-all, objective matter.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But later I learned that the Spirit is not only the pledge, but also the pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This pledging is a continual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I learned this, not from studying, but from experience.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In my experience I came to realize that a pledging was continually taking place within me.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The pledging of the Spirit is given for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Whenever I am disappointed or depressed, the pledging comes in to uplift me.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I experience this pledging daily, even hourly.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Pledging also means that something is given to us as a guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Through the Spirit s pledging, we are encouraged and stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whenever we feel that the situation is hopeless, the pledging fills us with hope.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>On the day we were saved, God began to pledge Himself to us, and this pledging continues day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is very difficult for a Christian in the spirit to not believe that God is with him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We easily and spontaneously believe this because we daily receive the pledging of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God is pledging all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When I am weak, He pledges Himself to me and becomes my encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When my expectations are low, He pledges Himself, and I have hope once again.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When it seems that my faith has ebbed away, He pledges Himself to me, and immediately my faith revives.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When it seems that I have no more love for the brothers and sisters, the Spirit pledges Himself, and more love for the saints flows in. I believe that we have all had experiences like this, although we may not have recognized or understood these experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>During the special ten-day trainings, I speak three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Some may wonder how I have the energy to speak so much at my age.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Many times I have been exhausted and tired by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But whenever I have this sense of tiredness, God immediately comes in to pledge Himself to me.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Because of the Spirit s pledging, I am ready to speak again at the next meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When I stand up and begin to speak, I am full of energy because of the pledging of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In fact, the more I speak, the more enjoyment I have.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When I return home after giving a message, I am exceedingly happy, much happier than before the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The reason for this is that during my speaking I receive a great deal of the Spirit s pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The pledging gives us more of God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The more of God we receive, the more assurance we have and the more appetite we have for God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When some hear about receiving more of God, they may wonder what we mean by more of God and may even regard such a saying as heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Doctrinally speaking, God is God, and there cannot be more of God.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But experientially speaking, we can receive more of God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>By the pledging of the Holy Spirit, we all are receiving more of God.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We know that God is ours by the pledging within us.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>A small sample, like the box of soil given in the purchase of land in ancient times, is within us as a pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This portion within us is increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Many of the older brothers and sisters can testify that throughout the years their appetite for God has been increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>When I began the ministry in this country in 1962, I was hungry for God.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But now, sixteen years later, my hunger for Him has been intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I am so hungry for God that I want to swallow Him up.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I can say to Him, O Lord Jesus, I would like to swallow You up.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Some may say that it is not only heretical but also crude to talk about swallowing up the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Nevertheless, I do intend to swallow Him up.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The more we receive of Him, the more there is to receive and the bigger He seems to become.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This enlargement of appetite comes from God s pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The more we taste of Him, the bigger is our appetite for Him; and the more appetite we have, the more we taste Him.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This is a glorious cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Do not think that the older saints are tired of eating God.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>No, we have a bigger appetite and eat more of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Hallelujah for the Spirit s pledging!</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>God is pledging Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The more He pledges, the more enjoyment we have.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>This enjoyment enlarges our appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Many have a rather small appetite for Christ when they first come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>But after they stay in the church for a period of time, their appetite increases.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The more we enjoy the Lord, the bigger is our appetite for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>The Spirit today is not only anointing us and sealing us, but also pledging in us.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>This means that He adds more of God into us little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>This takes place not once for all, but daily and hourly.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The pledging never stops; it goes on twenty-four hours a day.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We eat, and the Spirit pledges.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>The more we eat, the bigger our appetite becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>The bigger our appetite becomes, the more we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>By means of this cycle we daily participate in God.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>This cycle will continue until we get into eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>At that time, God will become our full enjoyment, and we shall have the full taste of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Many Christians do not even know that the anointing is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Some who know something about the anointing do not know about the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Although some know the sealing, hardly any have the knowledge of the Spirit s pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Probably in your whole Christian life you have never heard a message on the pledging of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>According to my experience, the Holy Spirit is constantly pledging within me, giving me more of God and more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>The more I receive of Christ, the more my appetite for Him increases.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Some may admit that they do not have a very large appetite for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>The reason for this is that they do not care for the pledging of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>We need to care not only for the anointing and the sealing, but also for the pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>We need to say, O Lord Jesus, You are so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Amen, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>If we do this, the sense of the Spirit s pledging will increase within us.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>What a real experience this is!</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Because many Christians care for doctrine but neglect the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging, they miss the experience of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>They have the Triune God in doctrine, but not in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>However, the Bible reveals that the Triune God is not for us to learn about as a mere doctrine, but for us to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>In the Lord s recovery we are not occupied with concepts and doctrinal points.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>We care mainly for the real experience of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Of course, if our experience is sound and healthy, it will correspond with the revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Many times I receive light firstly from my experience rather than from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>But when I check my experience with the Bible, I find that what I have experienced not only agrees with what is in the Bible but is strengthened and reinforced by the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>Everything must be experiential, not merely doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>Many of us can testify that daily we experience the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>As we experience the Spirit in this way, we receive more of the divine essence into our being, we have more of the expression of God, and we enjoy more of God.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>Oh, God is so tasty and delicious!</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>Once we have tasted Him, we cannot forget Him.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>Rather, we desire to taste Him more.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>Redemption here refers to the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 , that is, the transfiguration of our body of humiliation into a glorious one Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>The Holy Spirit today is a guarantee, a foretaste, and a sample of our divine inheritance until our body is transfigured in glory, at which time we shall inherit God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>The span of God s blessings bestowed upon us covers all the crucial points from God s selection in eternity past v. 4 to the redemption of our body for eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>We, God s redeemed ones, the church, are God s possession acquired by His purchase with the precious blood of Christ Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>In God s economy, God becomes our inheritance, and we become God s possession.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>We give nothing, and we get everything!</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>God acquired us at the greatest cost, but we inherit God at no cost.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>This is to the praise of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>TO THE PRAISE OF HIS GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>Because verse 14 ends with the words, to the praise of His glory, we need to consider this matter once again.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>This is the third time this phrase is repeated, this time as an ending to this section vv.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>3-14 concerning God s blessings to us.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>Verses 3 through 6 disclose what God the Father purposed for us; that is, He chose us and predestinated us unto sonship to the praise of the glory of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>Verses 7 through 12 reveal how God the Son accomplished what God the Father purposed; that is, He redeemed us and made us an inheritance of God to the praise of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>Verses 13 and 14 tell us how God the Spirit applies to us what God the Son has accomplished; that is, He seals us and is the guarantee and foretaste of our eternal, divine inheritance to the praise of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>The glory of the Triune God deserves the threefold praise in the blessings He bestows upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>The phrase to the praise of His glory is repeated three times because the Trinity is involved in God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>There is a threefold well-speaking concerning us and a threefold praise to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>The Triune God, the divine Trinity, deserves our threefold praise.</S>
