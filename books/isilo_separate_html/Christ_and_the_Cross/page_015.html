<p>The church is not a human organization, nor is it a religious group. Strictly speaking, the church is not even a Christian gathering. The church is Christ; the life of the church is Christ, and its content is also Christ. Everything related to the church is Christ. The church is not Mr. Chang plus Mr. Wang plus Mr. Lee plus all the other believers. The church must not have the human element, because it is the overflow of Christ. The church is the overflow of Christ&rsquo;s flowing into you, into me, and into every person who has the life of Christ. The totality of the Christ who overflows into every believer is the church. Every Christian added together is not the church. Rather, the addition of Christ in every believer is the church.</p>
<p>A brother who knew the Lord said that when we subtract the element of Adam from every person who has the life of Christ and then add together the element of Christ in these persons, we have the church. This is an accurate definition. The church is not a group of people; rather, it is Christ. The church is not composed of people who have Christ but of the Christ in these people. The Christ in you plus the Christ in me plus the Christ in every saved person equals the church. The Lord Jesus Christ plus the church equals the mysterious, corporate, universal Christ. We must always remember that the church is Christ. Only that which is Christ can be a part of Him and be His Body. Furthermore, only that which is Christ can express Him and be a vessel of His glory. This is the church!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE INCREASE<br />
AND SPREAD OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, and Christ Himself; hence, the church is Christ&rsquo;s increase and spread on the earth. Many people think that the church is nothing more than a group that proclaims and announces Christ to the world. However, according to the Scriptures, the church does not merely proclaim Christ; the church is Christ. The church does not merely announce Christ; the church increases and spreads Christ. As the Body of Christ, the church is Christ. The church on the earth is Christ on the earth. For example, my body is me. When my body comes here, I come here. Because my body is here, it is possible for you to see me and to know me; hence, my body also proclaims me to you. Moreover, my body is my presence. My body can proclaim me and enables you to see and know me, because my body is my very self. What my body is to me is what the church is to Christ. The church can proclaim Christ on the earth for people to see Christ and to know Christ, because the church is the Body of Christ; the church is Christ. Hence, Christ goes wherever the church goes, and Christ exists wherever the church exists. If the church is in Taipei, Christ is in Taipei, and if the church is in Kaohsiung, Christ is in Kaohsiung. The church in every locality not only proclaims Christ but also is Christ. The church is His increase and His spread.</p>
<p>Isaiah 53:10 says that after the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, He would &ldquo;extend His days.&rdquo; How can the Lord Jesus extend His days on the earth if He was resurrected and ascended to the heavens after accomplishing redemption? This is possible through the church. After producing the church through His death and resurrection, the Lord continues to live in the church. We can say that the church is the embodiment of Christ, just as Jesus the Nazarene was the embodiment of God. We can also say that the church is God in the flesh, His second incarnation, just as Jesus the Nazarene was God in the flesh, His first incarnation. In His first incarnation God became an individual man by the name of Jesus Christ. In His second incarnation He became a corporate man called the church.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:15 says, &ldquo;The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth,&rdquo; and verse 16 says, &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; The church in verse 15 is the mystery of godliness in verse 16. The church is not only the house of God and the pillar and base of the truth; the church is also the great mystery of godliness, that is, God manifested in the flesh. The man Jesus was the union of God and man, the mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh. Likewise, the church is the union of God and man, the mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh. Hence, the church as the mystery of godliness is the enlargement of Jesus Christ, the mystery of godliness. The manifestation of God in the man Jesus has been enlarged to be the manifestation of God in the church. Hence, the church is the enlargement of God becoming flesh, the enlargement of Christ; that is, the church is the increase and spread of Christ on the earth.</p>
<p>In relation to time, the church is the increase of Christ, and in relation to space, the church is the spread of Christ. Christ ascended to the heavens over nineteen hundred years ago, but He still has not left the earth; He is still on the earth. On the day of Pentecost He was in Jerusalem. Then He went to Damascus, Antioch, Asia Minor, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe. He went to these places through the church and in the church. The church is the increase of Christ through the centuries and the spread of Christ in place after place. To this day Christ is still increasing and spreading. For two thousand years Christ has been increasing and spreading in and through the church. He is still being manifested among men on the earth through the church, His Body.</p>
<p>Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11), and the church is the firstfruits of Christ being all and in all (James 1:18). Christ fills all and is in all in the church. As such, the church is the universal Christ, a great, corporate, universal man. The universe includes both space and time. Hence, Christ in the church is a universal man, increasing in time and spreading in space. Christ fills time and space so that His glorious fullness may be expressed.</p>
<p>For two thousand years Christ&rsquo;s existence on the earth has never been interrupted. Church history shows that Christ has been increasing and spreading on the earth through the church, His Body. The church that belongs to the Lord, loves Him, and is filled with Him has continued to exist on the earth without interruption from the time of the ascension to the present day. This means that the Lord to whom the church belongs, whom the church loves, and with whom the church is filled has continued to exist without interruption on the earth. On the one hand, Christ has ascended to the heavens, but on the other hand, He has continued to exist on the earth without interruption from the day of His ascension. Whenever the church that belongs to the Lord and loves Him exists, there is Christ&rsquo;s increase. Wherever the church that is filled with Christ exists, there is His spread.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
