   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>36 And seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were 1 harassed and cast away like 2 sheep not having a 2 shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>37 Then He said to His disciples, The harvest is great, but the workers few;</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>35 2 Every disease and every sickness signifies spiritual illness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>36 1 In Greek harassed refers to the sheep's being skinned by a cruel shepherd and thus suffering pain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Cast away refers to the sheep's being abandoned by a wicked shepherd and falling into a distressed condition in which they are homeless, wandering from place to place, and helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus' word here depicts a situation in which the pitiful Israelites were afflicted and in anguish under the hands of the chief priests and scribes, the evil shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>36 2 This indicates that the heavenly King considered the Israelites sheep and Himself as their Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Christ came to the Jews the first time, they were like lepers, paralytics, the demon possessed, and all manner of pitiful persons because they had no shepherd to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now in His kingly ministry for the establishing of His heavenly kingdom, He ministered to them not only as a Physician but also as a Shepherd, as prophesied in Isaiah 53:6 and 40:11.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we come to the enlargement of the King's ministry 9:35 10:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The continuation of the King's ministry in chapter nine enabled Him to reveal Himself as the Shepherd and as the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The heavenly King considered the people not only sheep but also the harvest v. 37 . The sheep needed shepherding, and the harvest needed reaping.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The King of the heavenly kingdom considered Himself not only the Shepherd of the sheep but also the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His kingdom is established with things of life that can grow and multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need to see a vision of the Lord Jesus as the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 38 the Lord told us to beseech the Lord of the harvest that He may thrust out workers into His harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, in His economy, God has a plan to accomplish; then there is the need for His people to beseech Him, to pray to Him, concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many times when we sense the need for workers, we sound out the call for help.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But from now on, whenever you sense the need for workers, you must first pray to the Lord of the harvest, saying, "Lord, here is Your harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We call on You to thrust out some reapers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lord, send more reapers into Your harvest."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praying like this will make a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever you pray that the Lord would send reapers into His harvest, you honor Him very much.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How different this is from inviting people to help you in your work!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you do that, you do not honor Christ as the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, it is a matter of your work, not of His harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You become the master of that work, and He is not considered as the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we need to call on Him and say, "Lord, You are the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The work in this field is Yours, and this harvest is Your crop.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We call on You for Your crop.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, send Your reapers."</S>
