   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The justification, the forgiveness, and the salvation God renders to us have all been "covenanted."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Matthew 26 the Lord Jesus enacted a new covenant, saying, "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" v. 28 . The new covenant is the Lord's blood, and His blood signifies His death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He died for our sins and transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The symbol of His death is the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The blood was the very means by which He made for us the new testament with His Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, redemption, justification, forgiveness, and salvation have all been covenanted by Him through His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today our salvation is a covenanted salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can use the buying of a house to illustrate this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may say we have bought a house, but we need the title deed as a proof of our purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The deed is an agreement, a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The house has been covenanted to us, and the guarantee of this covenant is the title deed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our purchase has been covenanted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It has been legalized.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a sense, we may say that the title deed, the covenant, equals the house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The title deed to the house is the covenant, and the covenant is the house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaiah says twice, in 42:6 and 49:8, that God has given Christ to us as our covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that God's salvation, God's blessings, and all of God's riches have been covenanted to us, and this covenant is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just as my title deed equals my house, Christ equals all of God's salvation, blessings, grace, reality, and riches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of this has been covenanted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our covenant is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's salvation, God's righteousness, God's justification, God's forgiveness, God's redemption, God's riches, and all He has and will do have been covenanted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Greek the word for covenant is also the word for testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every proper covenant eventually becomes a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before the person who enacted the covenant dies, it is the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After he dies, that covenant becomes a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A testament in today's terms is a will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What if your father had a will which said that you were entitled to ten million dollars, twenty houses, and fifteen commercial ships.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Would you not be happy?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our Father in heaven has given us a lot of things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have a will full of hundreds of bequests.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My heavenly Father has given me all these bequests, and they have been covenanted to me as a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have the New Testament of the Bible in our hands, but this is not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The reality of all the hundreds of bequests in the New Testament is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without Christ, the Bible is empty, so the real testament, the real will, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is our title deed, and this title deed is in our spirit as the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ as the Spirit is one with us, so we are one with Him as the testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We know that we have been forgiven, justified, redeemed, and saved because the Bible tells us so.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible is God's covenant, and after Christ's death this covenant has become a testament, a will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But without Christ the Bible is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, Christ is the covenant, and this Christ who is the covenant is in our spirit and has become one spirit with us 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This covenant is altogether according to God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A will is a legal matter that does not depend upon love or grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It depends on the law, and the law is a matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ has been given to us as such a legal covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is our forgiveness, our justification, our redemption, and our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not my word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is Paul's logic.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul said that the gospel is the power of God to save because the righteousness of God is in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that God has made Christ our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This righteousness is wrapped up with God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God's salvation today is a covenanted salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today the very salvation and redemption we have received is covenanted by Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He Himself actually is the covenant.</S>
