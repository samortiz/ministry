<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RECEIVING OF THE SAINTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h2 class=head1>SECOND THESSALONIANS 3:14-15</h2><p>In the previous chapter, we studied portions of Scripture concerning the matter of cutting a saint off from the fellowship of the church. Second Thessalonians 3:14-15 is another portion of Scripture related to this matter. “If anyone does not obey our word by this letter, mark this one that you may not associate with him, in order that he may be put to shame; and do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.” Seemingly, Paul’s words in these two verses are contradictory. In verse 14 Paul says that you may not associate with him. According to our understanding this means not to contact him, but in verse 15 Paul says to admonish him as a brother. How can these two verses be reconciled?<p>According to our natural understanding, Paul charged us to reject this person because he says that we may not associate with him, which to us means that we should have nothing to do with him. The second verse, however, tells us that we must admonish him as a brother. Although we may not associate with him, this does not mean that we should not contact him. This means we should not associate with him as a companion. We should not count him as an enemy or give him up but admonish him.<h2 class=head1>FIRST CORINTHIANS 5:13</h2><p>The strongest portion of the Word that we have looked at concerning the matter of cutting off a saint from the fellowship of the church is in 1 Corinthians 5:13 which says, “Remove the evil man from among yourselves.” Most Christian teachers interpret the word “remove” as meaning to excommunicate. Actually, there is no excommunication here. Paul uses the word “remove.” The fact that this is not a case of excommunication is also fully proven by Paul’s second Epistle to the Corinthians, The Apostle Paul told us that after he wrote the first Epistle, he regretted that his charge was too strong (2 Cor. 7:8). In addition, this brother who was condemned, repented, so Paul wrote a second letter, asking the church in Corinth to forgive this brother, to receive him, and to love him (2:5-10). Paul charged the saints there not to reject this brother at all; otherwise, Satan would have the ground to come in to the situation (2:11). Second Corinthians proves that what Paul charged in 1 Corinthians 5 was not an excommunication. Merely according to Paul’s own word in 1 Corinthians 5, to remove this evil one does not constitute a kind of excommunication. First, the word “remove” is not a legal term. All Paul says is to remove him. If this were a legislative matter, the word excommunicate might be used. Paul, however, did not use such a word. This shows us that our understanding concerning this matter should be reconsidered. All the leading ones who bear the responsibility for the Lord’s testimony of the churches must consider this because to deal with a brother is not a small thing. We need to study our constitution, which is the New Testament.
