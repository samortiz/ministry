   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brothers often come to me and ask, "Mr.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Nee, in your opinion, should we do this?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I ask why they have asked, and they say, "When I read the Bible, I found that one person expounded this passage one way, and another person expounded it another way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am confused."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do you see my point?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The principle of their living is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When others present them an interpretation of the law, they become confused.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is our emphasis merely the outward laws?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If our emphasis is merely the outward laws, we will not be clear about the inward guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are not clear, because we are already assured of the outward laws.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I often hold my brother's hand and point to his heart, saying, "Forget about what your head thinks and what your ears hear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Listen to what your heart has to say."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times theologians who have a very good knowledge of the Bible and who are very educated make judgments that are worse than those of illiterate, simple people who cannot read the Bible and who have no knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A simple person can tell you that he does not have the peace or that his conscience bothers him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The judgments of simple people and those without Bible knowledge are often better than those of famous, knowledgeable, and educated theologians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The issue today has nothing to do with outward matters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not what men say.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please be clear that it is not only a question of what the Bible says, but absolutely a question of what the Christ within us says.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If Christianity were not built upon this, we would have to say, "Blessed are the clever," "Blessed are the literate," or, "Blessed are those who have Bible knowledge."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank the Lord that Christianity is not built upon knowledge or literacy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christianity is built upon the fact that Christ lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A clever person will receive God's guidance if he obeys the inner voice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A simple person will also receive God's guidance if he obeys the inner voice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Recently, I met a seventy-year-old lady who could not read anything, and who had not read the Bible before.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet I have never met another person who had received as much guidance as she had.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She had been a believer for only four months; she could not read and did not have any Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you had talked to her about the law, she would not have been able to tell you anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She could not memorize any commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But her inner being was very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Her inner being directed her in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our rights and wrongs should come from within us and not from anything outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, man prefers the law, because he does not need a personal relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To follow the law, there is no need to face a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no price to pay, and one can get by easily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One does not have to be related to Christ in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as there are the outward qualifications and the knowledge, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in the New Testament, unless a person waits at the door of Wisdom and listens to His voice, he will not know what to do and where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many brothers have come to me to ask me what the Bible says about Christian conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Friends, if you do this, you do not know Christianity at all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The revelation of Christianity comes from this Book, but personal revelations do not come from this Book, but from within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you want to know general revelations, you can find them in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if you have only a general revelation, without personal revelation, you still do not understand Christianity, and you are still in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christianity is not a matter of what the Bible says or what the law says.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christianity is what the One within you says.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day a brother came to me and said, "Some say there is no difference between the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I read the Bible, I also do not find any difference between the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems that the two are indistinguishable.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I don't know if this is right or not."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I held his hand and said, "What is important is not how the Bible distinguishes them, but whether or not there is a distinction within you."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Christianity that many speak about only has the Bible; it does not have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people only have a Bible, without the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have the living Christ dwelling within us to be our life and our right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is our moral standard.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whatever He likes is right; whatever He does not like is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If He says it is right, it is right.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If He says it is wrong, it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Inner guidance is all that matters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But Peter, as well as many modern Peters, thought that the law needed to be added to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He said that there should be three tents, one of which should be for Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is why God had to come in to interrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God was saying that Christ is important, not the law.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I am not saying that this Book is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the future, when there is the opportunity, I will tell you how useful this Book is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But I am saying that Christianity is not just this Book.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christianity is absolutely Christ, the Christ who lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What then are the prophets?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The law can decide only certain things for us; it cannot decide everything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The law can tell us what is right and wrong about many things; but it cannot tell us what is right and wrong about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The law can tell us not to covet, steal, or commit fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But it cannot tell us if we should go to Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The law can tell us what can be eaten and cannot be eaten, but it cannot tell us what we should eat when we go home tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Leviticus 11 tells us what food is clean and unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But the law cannot tell us what we should eat when we go home tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The law can tell us what we should do when we are sick, but it cannot tell us if our sickness will be healed, or if we will die of our sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is why there are prophets in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Old Testament not only has the law but the prophets as well.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is not only Moses, but Elijah as well.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What is a prophet?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A prophet fills up the lack of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The law is dead, while a prophet is living.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The law is written down, while a prophet speaks, guides, and tells men which way they should take.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the main difference between the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The law tells us God's general principle of right and wrong, while the prophets tell us God's fine details concerning right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The law deals with right and wrong in principle, while the prophets deal with right and wrong in specific details.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The prophets give us the guidance and the way for us to take personally.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What is a prophet?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A prophet is one who tells you if your sickness will be healed or if you will die.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He is one who tells you if God will punish you or if He will bless you.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In other words, the law is the abstract guidance, while the prophet is the specific guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I believe it is right to say it this way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>One is abstract, while the other is specific.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The law merely shows us the moral principle before God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But the prophet shows us what we should do today and where we should go.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is absolutely something specific and personal.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We can go to the Bible to find out if God has commissioned us to preach the gospel; it is easy to find the basis and principles for matters like these.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is the aspect of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But there is also the aspect of the prophet, which is personal and specific.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Does God want me to go to Yungnan or Annan?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Does God want me to go to Tibet or Siam?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>How should we go, and when should we go?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>These are specific; they are not abstract principles.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is why there is not only the law but also the prophets in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When the two things were present, God's children were guided on the proper path.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The prophets are a special class of people who help others to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Do not think that the prophets only foretell.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In the Old Testament the prophets find out God's will on behalf of others.</S>
