   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY THE WORK IN KULING AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WORK THROUGHOUT CHINA Date: September 8, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Kuling</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I feel that we should let the brothers and sisters know as soon as possible about the way ahead of them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some are still not clear about what to do, while others are clear already.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who do not know can pray to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you do not have a clear guidance from the Lord, you should let us know as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let me talk a little about the work here in Kuling and also about the work throughout China.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have considered dividing our work into ten divisions or regions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At least one or two of these regions have made a start already.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1 Shanghai region: This includes the area along the Shanghai-Hangchow railway.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The center is Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 Foochow region: This takes care of Fukien province and Taiwan province.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The center is Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Northern Fukien and southwestern Fukien are not included in this region.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3 Wenchow region: Northern Fukien is part of this region.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a definite need to have a start in this region.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are well over a hundred churches in this region.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our strength lies in the clarity of the teaching concerning the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our weakness lies in the fact that our work does not have a center.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There was no interruption in our meetings even during the war years because we were clear about the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we did not have pastors and preachers, we were able to carry on with the breaking of bread, worship, and preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we became scattered because we did not have a center for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We admit that the mistake is on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are willing to face this mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we have seen clearly from the Bible that there are regions to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>4 Peking-Tientsin region: We hope that a region will be raised up in northern China, including Peking and Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We hope that gradually this region will be extended to Shansi, Suiyuen, Ningshia, and even to Inner Mongolia.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before the war there were four million Catholics in China but less than six hundred thousand Protestants.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the war, there were three million Catholics, while the Protestants numbered about four hundred and eighty thousand, or slightly less than five hundred thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although there has been a slight decrease, the decrease is not significant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many were lost during these years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The above numbers also include the nominal ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thirty percent of the Catholics are living in Inner Mongolia.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their work extends westward towards Shansi.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>5 Tsingtao region: This region extends west of the Jiao-Ji Railway and south of the Jin-Pu Railway.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>6 Canton region: This is the southern China region.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Canton is the center; it includes Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The further one moves south in this region, the more unstable the situation becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The people are less dependable, and the testimony is less promising.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This region bears the responsibility of both Kwangtung and Kwangsi provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>7 Hakka region: When we were at Custom Lane, we felt the need to have Swatow as a center.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are over thirty assemblies in southwestern Kiangsi and southeastern Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can even count southwestern Fukien as part of this region.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>8 The literature work: The literature work, such as the publishing of books and periodicals, is considered a separate unit of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such works are handled by Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>9 The work in Kuling: The work in Kuling is also separate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is situated in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>10 Itinerant preaching: In the past we paid much attention to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the line of Antioch; yet we forgot about the line of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today we have to pay equal attention to the Jerusalem line and the Antioch line.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>During the past few months we have been dealing with personal spiritual problems.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From now on, we have to deal with the Lord concerning our work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If any of us has any kind of feeling at all, please let us know so that together we can make the proper decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The work among these ten areas is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are short both in manpower and in finances.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us consider again in detail the work in these ten areas.</S>
