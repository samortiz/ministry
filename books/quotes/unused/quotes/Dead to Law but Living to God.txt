They live to the law because they do not have God, just as those who do not have a car have no choice but to walk
In addition to not knowing God and not having God, they have the evil power of Satan within them that incites them to sin and to do evil
Although they do not have God and even have Satan within them, as human beings they still have a desire to be good and to do good
One category consists of those who are capable of committing every crime under the sun including being treacherous cruel deceitful and evil
Those who do evil give up the law, thereby rejecting God, and those who do good keep the law, thereby also rejecting God
Although doing good might appear to be a worthy goal, yet it is not the right goal, and in fact it is the wrong goal
The reason they dare to do evil things is that they do not acknowledge the existence of God; they have put God aside
People like this have good behavior their words are trustworthy and their character is good but they do not acknowledge the existence of God
He wanted man to have fellowship with Him, to be filled with Him, to live in Him, and to be mingled with Him as one entity
As those who have the life of God, we would not do evil, neither would we do good; even the more, we would reject death
When someone eats of this tree it may seem to be evil but it is actually death or it may seem to be good but in reality it is still death
As vessels to contain God according to His purpose in creating man, we should live to God instead of living to the law
These two portions of the Scriptures refer to the question of the law, and they both point out that the law is versus God
The apostle Paul was previously a keeper of the law; as such, he declared to all that as to the requirements of the law, he was blameless
One day however while he was zealously serving and doing things for God the Lord came and shone upon him saying Why are you persecuting Me
Paul was a person who was serving God zealously and keeping the law of God, yet he turned out to be a persecutor of God
Because we are all living under the law, whenever we transgress the law and its regulations, we are convicted inwardly
In addition, afterward we may be afraid that we will transgress again, so we confess, make a resolution, and pray to ask for the Lord's help
In the garden of Eden after Adam was created, God placed him in front of the tree of life, which denotes God Himself
Thereafter, man began to know love and hate, because good and evil are the two sides of one thing; the two are actually one
As another example, a sister may feel that she has a bad temper, so she makes up her mind to endeavor to change herself
Such a determination, such a decision, and even such a desire to love the Lord and the brothers and sisters are also part of the law
We think it is wrong to cause our mother who loves us so much to be so angry and cry, so we determine not to make her angry again
We also discover that there is no way for us to be gentle and that it is also difficult for us to be humble so we pray asking for Gods help
God told Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for in the day that he ate of it he would surely die
Unfortunately, we mistakenly think that we must reject that which is evil but must try to fulfill that which is good
We can understand what it means to be dead to evil, and it is also easy to do; however, to be dead to good is not easy
Being dead to the law means that we reject any good thought that enters into us, just as we reject any evil thought
Living to God is not ordinances, hopes, letters, or methods, but it is the living God being our life within us
In Philippians 367 the apostle Paul says As to zeal persecuting the church as to the righteousness which is in the law become blameless
The revelation referred to at the end of this passage should be put together with the revelation mentioned in verse 12
Mark 1:32-38 says, 'And when evening fell and the sun had set, they brought to Him all those who were ill and those who were demon possessed
He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and He cast out many demons and did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him
Rising very early in the morning, while it was still night, He went out and went away to a deserted place, and there He prayed
Verses 25-27 of chapter six say, 'And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did You get here?
Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you'
Verse 60 says, 'Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard this, said, This word is hard; who can hear it'?
Verses 66-68 say, 'From that time many of His disciples went back to what they left behind and no longer walked with Him
Innumerable people who are famous and successful have also accepted religion in hopes of obtaining the material blessings of human life
Thousands of years of human history have proved that religion is the best place for the practice of moral culture
Throughout the generations those who have been occupied with the improvement of behavior have always attached themselves to a religion
Throughout the generations many people who were thoughtful, moral, and idealistic have repeatedly discovered this need deep within man
With a little effort, we can easily discover that in every religion there are people with these three types of needs
Those who make an effort to meet the need in the deepest part of their being are very few; rarely is there even one among a hundred
Perhaps some will ask, 'Does not the Bible tell us that the Lord healed the sick, cast out demons, and fed people?
We can use three portions of Scriptures to prove that the Lord did not come to the earth to provide people with material blessings
The next day, rising very early, the Lord Jesus went away to a deserted place, and there He prayed until the crowd came looking for Him
It is because their faith was not a genuine faith but a faith for their own well-being, for their sicknesses to be healed
When trials come and those who have this kind of belief do not see any blessing or any answer to their prayer, they may no longer believe
The Lord told them not to seek the food which perishes but to seek the food which abides unto eternal life, which He could give them
He who comes to the Lord shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into the Lord shall by no means ever thirst
The Lord came to the earth not to give people blessings; He did not come to feed people with bread or to heal people of their sicknesses
Many have believed in the Lord for prosperity, but little do they know that prosperity is a matter of religion
The Lord's salvation is not a matter of prosperity; rather, the Lord's salvation is altogether apart from prosperity
Many people believe in the Lord because they find it difficult to conduct themselves properly in a human society which is so dark and fallen
The unbelievers think that they can benefit greatly by being with such a group of people, so they accept the Christian religion
Paradoxically, when we preach the gospel, we often begin with personal prosperity, saying, 'Oh, it is so good to believe in Jesus!
We may tell those who have believed in Jesus, 'Since you have believed in Jesus, you have to be proper in your conduct and walk
The gospel seems to have become a bitter medicine requiring it to be sugarcoated not only with prosperity but also with behavior improvement
A person who seeks for inner satisfaction is a person with more depth; this kind of person seems to be more noble
As a religionist he did not pay much attention to being prosperous rather he was a person with ideas wisdom a future and accomplishments
As a person chosen by the Lord, Paul should have taken the way of the Lord; instead, he took the way of religion
Very often those who are apparently zealous Christians are actually enemies of Christ in the eyes of God; they are opposing Christ every day
If our worship to God is not related to Christ is not mingled with Christ and is not Christ doing it with us from within then it is religion
The real worship to God is the Christ who is in us, who puts us upon Himself, and who fills us with Himself, worshipping God with us
Sometimes we may meet someone who is so proper and upright and who is a genuinely good person but in him we cannot sense Christ or taste God
Worship with Christ mingled within and improved behavior with Christ mingled within are the salvation of Christ
Previously, due to our ignorance, we were not aware of the existence of our naturalness, but now we have heard and now we know about it
At most, our hearing of the truth can lead us to understand the truth; it cannot lead us to touch the spiritual reality of the truth itself
At such a moment we not only have a mental understanding of the truth, but we also are touched within by the Holy Spirit
When we first heard the gospel, we may have heard a very clear message on the truth of the gospel and truly appreciated it
We are saved when we touch God after receiving the revelation of the Holy Spirit in our spirit through the message we heard
Only when the Holy Spirit comes to us can we have faith; such faith is the issue of the work of the Holy Spirit in our spirit
Although this truth of redemption may genuinely win our appreciation, it does not necessarily generate faith in us
The doctrine itself cannot accomplish this work this is altogether the work of the Holy Spirit working by and through the doctrine we heard
A brother testified My hip has been crippled also my natural life has been crippled this natural life of mine has been touched by the Lord
In response Brother Nee said, 'A person who has really been crippled does not need to remember that he is crippled
He does not need to tell others that he is crippled, because as soon as he walks, people will notice that he is crippled
A person who acts crippled has to always remember that he is crippled, because once he forgets, his real condition is exposed
His outward behavior is not due to his own decision or some teaching; rather, it is because he is forbidden by the sense of life within him
If the Holy Spirit does not move in us, then no matter how much truth we understand, we still do not have any spiritual reality in us
If we are prepared, then whenever the Holy Spirit moves in us, we will be able to follow and cooperate with Him
Spiritual reality is not doctrine and not even objective truth; spiritual reality is the particular work done by the Holy Spirit within us
Suppose that after hearing the gospel, a person confesses that Jesus died for him and also believes that Jesus is his Savior
How can it be that two people can have the same thoughts and could say the same things, yet one is saved while the other is not?
If the Holy Spirit works in them, then they will be saved because they will have the reality of the word they heard
If there is no work of the Holy Spirit, then they will not be saved because there will not be the reality and effect of the word within them
Doctrines cannot afford us the spiritual reality; only through the work of the Holy Spirit can we have the spiritual reality
On the other hand sometimes we already have the spiritual reality but being deceived by the enemy we think that we do not have the reality
If a person has clearly been saved yet is doubtful about his salvation, that is a deception that comes from the enemy
The problem is that either we do not have the reality yet think we have it, or we already have it yet doubt that we have it
In our spiritual pursuit we must first know that spiritual reality is neither doctrine nor knowledge but the work of the Holy Spirit in us
Next, we should not consider that we have already obtained the spiritual reality, neither should we consider that we are lacking it
Today whether the new creation prevails over the old creation or the old creation prevails over the new creation is our own responsibility
Whenever God demands something within us, we have to learn to say to God, 'O God, You win; may You prevail in me'
Whenever we feel that there is a struggle between God and us, we will be able to pray, 'O God, have mercy on me!
It says that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily then it says that we who belong to Christ have been made full in Christ
Generally speaking, religion focuses on three items: material blessings, behavior improvement, and man's inner satisfaction
According to the revelation of the Word, the salvation that the Lord has given us is altogether different from these three items
Many people are very prosperous in their enterprises and have no lack of material things, yet they still feel as if there is a lack
Although sometimes they try to convince themselves intellectually that they ought to be contented, they simply are not satisfied deep within
A lightbulb is created with a purpose with an intention it is specifically made for electricity to pass through it so that it may give light
If we do not let electricity enter into the lightbulb, it will be useless and its existence will be meaningless
The Bible tells us that the way God created man was different from the way He created all the other things in the universe
God created man in His image and according to His likeness because God wanted man to be a vessel to contain Him
When the Coca-Cola bottle was being made, an empty space was left inside so that Coca-Cola could be put into it
In the same way, when God created man, He left an empty space within man for the purpose of filling it with Himself
The reason why people throughout the ages have discovered that they feel empty within is because they are in fact empty
Religion teaches people to sit still in meditation in order to turn their whole being from the outside to the inside
All these things, which may afford some outward enjoyment, cause people to turn outward and therefore experience a greater emptiness within
The richer a person becomes, the emptier he will feel within; the higher his position is, the less satisfied he will be within
Regardless of whether a person is drawn outward or inward, he is still human, and as such he is basically still an empty vessel
In the beginning when God created man He reserved an empty space for Himself that He might work Himself into man hence man was created empty
God comes into us and mingles Himself with us, making us a part of God; the result is that the creating God is mingled with the created man
The Scriptures reveal that all of us, the saved ones, will arrive at a certain stage; that is, we will be filled unto the fullness of God
Most people understand believing in Jesus as a matter of simply having our sins forgiven and being able to go to heaven
John 1:12 says, 'But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name'
Not only do we confess with our mouth that we believe in Him, but we also receive Him into us from within our heart
To believe in this glass of orange juice is to receive the orange juice into us; to believe in Christ is to receive Christ into us
The element of this Christ is nothing less than God Himself, because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily
Ephesians chapter one tells us that we, the saved ones, are the church, the Body of Christ, and that Christ is the Head of the church
The reason is that the intention of God in coming into us is not only to satisfy us but even more to mingle Himself with us
We have to clearly differentiate between these two aspects-Christ as the tabernacle and Christ as the offerings
At the end He even offered His own body as a burnt offering that He might live for God in our stead to satisfy God's desire
He was so balanced, fine, and perfect, and as such, He presented Himself before God for God's satisfaction and enjoyment
Besides the two offerings mentioned above, there are the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
The more we draw near to Him the more we feel that He is so dear and lovable the more we pray to God the sweeter and happier we feel within
Romans 5:11 says, 'Boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation'
When in faith we see the precious blood shed on the cross and know that the Lord Jesus has solved the problem for us, within we are at peace
The best part, the fattest part, including all the fat, had to be placed on the altar as God's food for His satisfaction
God and we, we and God, are both satisfied; therefore, God and we, we and God, can be at peace with one another
On the one hand, He became God's food to satisfy God's need, and on the other hand, He became our food to satisfy our need
In the Bible sin does not refer to the outward actions of sin; rather, it refers to the source of sin that dwells in us
In other words, first the Lord came in the likeness of the flesh of sin, then He became the sin offering, and finally He condemned sin
In the beginning, after Adam was created and before his fall, he did not sin because he was not sin; he was a man
In Genesis chapter three after he had eaten the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , another element was added into him
In the Old Testament a bronze serpent was lifted up on a pole; in the New Testament a man-Jesus-was lifted up on the cross on Mount Golgotha
Of lifting up a man, God lifted up a bronze serpent, because in His eyes all the children of Israel had become serpents
There is a difference between the serpent that was lifted up on the pole and the serpents that bit the children of Israel
The bronze serpent typified Christ who became sin on our behalf and who was in the likeness of the flesh of sin
All our sins-including lying, coveting, and all other actions by which we offend either God or man-were borne for us by the Lord Jesus
These two offerings are closely linked together-the trespass offering follows the sin offering, and the two offerings are actually one
After we are saved for a period of time, we see that not only our conduct is poor, but even our being is problematic
Whenever we see how corrupt and evil our conduct is and thus acknowledge that Christ died for us, we receive Christ as our trespass offering
At this moment within us we are joyful, at ease, peaceful, and comfortable; moreover, our heart is full of thanksgiving and praise
We have a sense that Christ is so good and so precious and that He is our peace, our reconciliation, and our acceptance to God
Our trespasses and our sin were dealt with through Christ's redemption, so there is no more problem between God and us
Romans 12:1 says, 'Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service'
In the same manner, all that we have must be for God alone; if God accepts us, then all that we have will become ashes
We go on further to see that Christ lived for God and that, like Him, we must also live for God since we have received Christ
He put everything to death giving up His all on the cross for God so we also must be like Him putting our all on the altar to live for God
At this point God accepts us, and we become a burnt offering, turning into a heap of ashes for God's satisfaction
At this moment we not only experience Christ, but through experiencing Him we become food to God for His satisfaction
Every person, regardless of which kind of offering he offers, has a reaction or response to his presentation of the offering
A person who offers the peace offering has a grateful heart because he feels that he is so unworthy to have received such great grace
When a person enjoys Christ as the burnt offering, he will surely give himself completely to God and live for God in all things
In the church life the participation of the saints in the service is a manifestation of the extent of their growth in life
If the service in a local church is not the issue of life, it will need to be organized and promoted using human methods
As a result, the reality of the church life and service will be lost, and the church will degrade into a social organization
If the service in the church is committed only to those who are capable and highly educated, then it is reduced to a kind of social activity
The manifestation of Christ's life is based upon the breaking of the cross, and the breaking of the cross is based upon our learning
They do not know the way of the cross, nor have they experienced anything of the cross, so how can they know the breaking of the cross?
The reason the believers do not recognize their natural life and their flesh is that they do not see the way of dealing
As a result, very few in the church service are able to bear the responsibility of taking care of practical affairs
Although in the church there are many saved ones who all have the life of Christ, there are very few who manifest the life of Christ
It is possible to fake many things, but it is impossible to be fake in doing the things related to the Lord's work and the church
When the life of Christ is manifested in the believers, the functions for the various services will be manifested in them
According to the Lord's arrangement and according to the requirement of life, no Christian can serve God independently in a locality
In the church the work of the Holy Spirit does not begin with an individual but with a corporate group of people
Regrettably, a problem arose halfway through the flow of the work; there was a sharp contention between Barnabas and Paul
From this we see that the Holy Spirit records only the work that is in the divine stream, the work of the Body
We can see that the Lord's work is entrusted to many workers; however, these workers do not work individually but corporately
Through it all there was no independent move by any individual; rather, there was only the functioning of a corporate body
Some of the serving ones can serve only by themselves and are not able to bring others along to serve together with them
In the Bible, and in the New Testament in particular, there are many examples of apprentices in serving the Lord
They must allow this kind of character to be broken by the cross; otherwise, they can only do their own work alone
Like master craftsmen teaching apprentices, we all need to learn to bring others along to serve together with us
