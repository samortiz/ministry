<p>Hebrews 6:20 tells us that Christ is the Forerunner. We are all runners, running from all the things outside of God. We run into God. The first One who was running into God was the man Jesus Christ, the Nazarene. He was the forerunner, running from anything other than God into God. He is now within the veil in the Holy of Holies where God is. He was the first to get there. He was the forerunner, and we also are running the same race. We are running into God. Christ took the lead to run this race, and He is bringing us into God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">11. AS THE HIGH PRIEST</h2>
<p>As our High Priest He prays for us and takes care of our case (Heb. 4:14; 7:26). He sustains us and supplies us with all our need for the purpose of dispensing God into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">12. AS OFFERINGS FOR SIN AND SINS</h2>
<p>Christ is also the offerings for sin and sins (Heb. 9:26, 28; 10:12). First of all He is the sin-offering. He is the offering for sin in the singular number, referring to our sinful nature. Then He is also the offering for sins, in the plural number. These are our trespasses and offenses and wrongdoings. Christ is the offering both for sin and sins. Sin is the biggest obstacle which frustrates God from dispensing Himself into us. Christ has solved this problem, taking away our sin, to remove the obstacle so that God can have a free way to dispense Himself into us. He &ldquo;offered one sacrifice for sins,&rdquo; dealing with all our trespasses and wrongdoings. Hallelujah! Today the way is fully cleared up for us to contact God and for God to dispense Himself into us. There is a free way and a free course for God to dispense Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">13. AS THE PASSOVER</h2>
<p>Christ is also our Passover (1 Cor. 5:7). Because we have Christ, nothing can condemn us (Rom. 8:1). Even God cannot condemn us (Rom. 8:33). We have such a Passover. On the day of the Passover the blood of the lamb was shed for all the children of Israel, and God&rsquo;s condemnation passed over them. That was the Passover so that the children of Israel might eat the meat of the lamb to receive life. So the Passover is for the dispensing of life into the redeemed ones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">14. AS THE MEDIATOR</h2>
<p>First Timothy 2:5 says that Christ is our Mediator. A mediator is a middle man. When there are problems between two parties, there is the need of a mediator. There were problems between us and God, but Christ is our Mediator to make everything right so that God can dispense Himself into us. For example, in my home we use electricity for light, for heating, for cooling, for power. Sometimes there is the problem with the air conditioner or with the heater or with the lights. So we always need a mediator. We call a dear brother who lives in Anaheim to come and look at the problem. With God there is no problem, but with us there are many problems. Just a little unhappiness with your wife becomes a problem and the heavenly &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t work so well. Then you have to call upon the Mediator. When you call upon Him, He is very present. He clears up your problem and right away God flows once again. Just a little wrong attitude hinders God flowing within you. Again you have to call upon the Mediator: O Lord Jesus! Then the flow is restored. This is Christ as our Mediator for the dispensing of God into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">15. AS THE SURETY OF THE BETTER COVENANT</h2>
<p>Christ is the surety of the better covenant (Heb. 7:22). With an agreement or contract, there is the need of a guarantee or a guarantor. Jesus Christ is both the guarantee and the guarantor for dispensing God into us. In order for God to dispense Himself into us He made a covenant with us. To assure us of His dispensing Himself into us, God signed the contract. Christ is the guarantee and the guarantor, the surety, of this contract.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
