   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-IMPARTING IN THE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is described in 5:14-17 concerning the life-giving petition can be experienced only by those who are deep in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 14 John speaks of prayer that is according to God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to pray this kind of prayer, we must be one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are deeply one with Him, we shall know His will, and we shall also know the situation of the one who is sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because this one is our brother, someone very close to us in the Lord, we shall know his real situation before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This matter is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you are one with the Lord and know a sinning brother s condition and situation before the Lord, you will then know the Lord s will and be able to pray according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because you know the Lord s will, you will also know whether or not this brother will die because of his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These verses indicate that we who have eternal life can pass this life on to others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that we can be a channel through which eternal life is supplied to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can be a channel for eternal life to flow out of us and into others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 16 refers to this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this verse the one who asks is also the one who gives life to the sinning brother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the one who asks will give life to the one concerning whom he asks.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The asker, who is abiding in the Lord, who is one with the Lord, and who is asking in one spirit with the Lord, becomes the means through which God s life-giving Spirit can give life to the one for whom he asks.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a matter of life-imparting in the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Notice that in verse 16 John speaks of someone seeing his brother sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The words his brother point to a brother who is close to him, someone who is so close to him that he is a part of him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you have a brother close to you in this way and do not know whether this brother will die because of his sin, then you are not deep in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you are truly deep in the Lord and are one with Him, as you consider the brother s situation, you will enter into the Lord s heart and know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You will know whether this brother, who is so intimate to you, will die because of his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then you will know how to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You will know whether or not to pray for him to be forgiven and healed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If this brother s sin is unto death, you will realize that you should not pray to impart life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, you may be burdened to pray for him from another angle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>My burden in this message is to show you that the eternal life within us is real and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, we can enjoy this eternal life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, we can pass on this eternal life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can be a channel for eternal life to flow out from us, or through us, to others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the experience of being a channel for eternal life to flow out to others is a deep matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This cannot be done in a superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we would be a channel for eternal life to flow out to others, we must be deep in the Lord, and we must know the Lord s heart by being in His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have entered into the Lord to such a degree, spontaneously we shall know the Lord s will concerning a brother close to us who has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because we know the Lord s will concerning the brother s situation, we shall know how to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>TESTIMONY OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although I do not claim to be so deep in the Lord, I can testify that through the years I have known some cases of brothers who sinned unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A certain brother, who was very close to me, fell into a certain kind of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During the course of fellowship with the Lord, I had the deep sense that the Lord would take this brother away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I realized that this brother would die because of his sin, and eventually he did die for this reason.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I prayed for this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, I had the intention to pray for his healing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the Spirit within me prohibited me from praying in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How do I know that I was prohibited by the Spirit to pray for this brother s healing?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I knew because as I was praying for him, I had the anointing within me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when I was about to pray for his healing, the anointing stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It was in this way I realized I should not pray for that brother s healing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Simultaneously, I began to understand that probably the Lord would not heal him, that he would probably die as a result of his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then with much anointing from the Lord, I prayed for this brother from another angle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I prayed for the Lord to comfort him and his wife and to care for his family.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In some cases, when I tried to pray for the healing of such a brother, I was rebuked by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord said to me, You are praying according to your own wish.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This brother is close to you, and you love him and want him to live longer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You are praying not according to the will of God, but according to your own desire.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Knowing that I could not continue to pray in that way, I came to realize that the Lord would probably take the brother away.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This has been my experience with some cases in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In 5:14-17 John shows us that eternal life is practical and can be experienced by us in a deep way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In these verses we see the need to live in the divine life to such an extent that we are absolutely one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then as we pray we shall know whether or not there is the anointing in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If there is the anointing, we should go on to pray for a brother according to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if there is no anointing, we may be praying in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we have these experiences, we know that eternal life is real and practical.</S>
