   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Power of Work</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If an experienced Christian in the Lord is present at a revival meeting, he will know whether the preacher is using his soul-power or the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once I met a friend who told me that a certain person's preaching was quite powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I then responded that I had not met that person and dared not to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later I wrote down several words in a notebook and gave it to my friend, asking, "Full of power, but what kind of power was it?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His experiences in the Lord were not as deep as his wife's, and he could not understand the question.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He turned around to ask his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After she looked at the notebook, she smiled and said, "Indeed, this is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What kind of power is it?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One brother once said to us that whether or not a person has power does not depend on how loud he can pound on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, in our meeting, we should discern whether one's power comes from his soul or from his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can consider this matter from two sides: 1 from the preacher himself, and 2 from the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose a preacher depends on his past experiences and thinks that just because someone repented and confessed his sins because he preached a certain way in the past, he should preach the same way, expecting someone to repent and confess again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Or suppose he tries to tell stories about the repentance and confession of others with the hope that this will stir up his audience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If this is his intention, we can be sure that he is working by his soul-power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the contrary, it would be wonderful if preachers could have attitudes like the leaders in the Welsh Revival, who asked God to subdue them, bind the power in their soul, restrain their self, and refuse anything that would come out of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If this is the motive and the pursuit of a preacher, his soul-power can be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The preacher will be able to discern the difference between these two kinds of power and realize how different they are.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He will then be able to tell which of his works are done by his soul-power and which are done by God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are three aspects to the work of the Holy Spirit: 1 The Holy Spirit regenerates us; 2 the Holy Spirit dwells within us so that we can bring forth the fruit of the Spirit; and 3 the Holy Spirit comes upon us so that we have power to testify.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The power of the Holy Spirit is always mentioned in the Bible with reference to working and witnessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the work of the Holy Spirit upon us; it is not the work of the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the power of the Holy Spirit is for work, whereas the indwelling of the Spirit is for fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the original text, whenever the Spirit is mentioned in the Bible with reference to power, it always says that the Spirit "comes upon" us, while whenever the Spirit is mentioned with respect to fruit-bearing, it says that He "dwells within" us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What does come upon mean?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It means that the power given to us by the Spirit is outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot sense it by ourselves and cannot have any assurance of it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If anyone asked us in a meeting, "Are you sure about today's meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you have the assurance that someone will be saved?", we would definitely respond, "I do not have any assurance and do not sense anything."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The reason is that this power is outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The power of the Spirit is the power outside of us and cannot be laid hold of by us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How about the power of the soul?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With the power of the soul, one has the assurance; he knows that his message will cause someone to weep and make someone repent and confess.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What does it mean to be "dynamic"?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It merely means to have the power of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once I felt powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although people told me that I could get by, I still felt powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>So I went to see an older and more experienced sister Miss Barber .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I asked her, "You have great power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But why do I not have any power?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She knew me very well and often helped me in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Looking at me seriously, she said, "Do you want the power that you can feel or the kind you cannot feel?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Which one do you want?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As soon as I heard her, I understood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I said, "I do not want the kind that I can feel."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She then said, "Remember, there is no need for the person to feel the power coming from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man's responsibility is just to obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The power of the Spirit is never to be felt by the person himself."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of course, the sense in the spirit is a different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, our duty is to ask God to bind the power of our soul, our own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must submit to God entirely.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything else is left for God to do and is none of our business.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we exercise the strength of our soul to serve, we can feel it; this is just like the hypnotists who know they will have a certain result if they do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They know what they should do first, what to do next, and what to do as the third step.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The danger of many preachers on the platform is that they do not realize that they are actually exercising their own soulish power.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They think they have the power; but, in fact, they are working by the power of their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are only gaining people by their psychic strength.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some people say that preachers should pay attention to psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although we know clearly that we can gain people by applying psychological methods, we ought to avoid these methods and not exercise the psychic power.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>While I was working in Shantung, one professor spoke to another professor: "All these preachers are working with emotions."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It so happened that on that same afternoon I was giving a message to the believers on the undependability and futility of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That professor who was told that preachers worked with emotions was in the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He heard my word and said, "It is too bad that the other professor who claimed that preachers work with emotions is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Otherwise, he could have heard that emotions are undependable."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Please bear in mind that all work by the emotion is not dependable and shall pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In a meeting, if the Holy Spirit is working, men have no need to exert their own strength and no need to do anything by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a preacher is working by his soulish power, he will have to exert much strength.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In addition, he will need to resort to other methods such as weeping, shouting, jumping, emotional appeals, repetitive singing of a chorus, or telling moving stories.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I do not mean that hymns and stories cannot be used in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But they must be used only within proper limits.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The only reason for preachers to perform is to cause the audience to be moved and stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We all know that even though certain people are not necessarily more handsome or eloquent than others, they have particular attractions which attract people to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In reality, they only possess more attractiveness than others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>People often tell me, "You have great influence on someone, why don't you draw him over?"</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I respond, "This is of no use, because it is only natural and not spiritual."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many people misunderstand Christianity and think that it is a kind of psychic function or something within the psychic realm.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is only because we believers have made the same mistake first.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we cannot attract our parents and children with the so-called power from God, any greater attraction that we have would be useless and not attract others.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Even if we can draw others by our attraction, it will still amount to nothing.</S>
