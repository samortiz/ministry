   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE SEVENTEEN A FULL PICTURE OF GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY HIS DISPENSING Scripture Reading: Jer 15:10 17:27</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message I would like to give a brief word concerning God's economy as it is presented in the book of Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapters fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen of Jeremiah we have a full picture of God's economy by His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>JEREMIAH'S DISAPPOINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jeremiah 15:10 16:9 is a record of a conversation involving three parties: Jeremiah, his mother, and Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jeremiah spoke in a human way, and God also spoke in a human way, speaking as if He were a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this conversation and in Jehovah's further statement of Judah's sins 16:10 17:27 , God's economy is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The book of Jeremiah reveals that God surely judges the evil ones, and sometimes He uses certain evil ones to judge other evil ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was the situation in chapter fifteen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God was intending to judge the people of Israel, and He sent Jeremiah to tell them that He would use the Babylonians to punish them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They responded by persecuting Jeremiah, and this caused him to be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In his disappointment Jeremiah said to his mother, "Woe is me, my mother, because you bore me, / A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole land.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>/ I have not lent with interest, / Nor have they lent to me; / Yet everyone curses me" 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jeremiah's mother was silent, but Jehovah came in to comfort and encourage him, saying, "Surely I will set you free for your good; / Indeed I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you / In a time of trouble and in a time of distress.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>/ Can one break iron, / Iron from the north, or bronze?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word iron here refers to the Babylonians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God was assuring Jeremiah that He would use the Babylonians to punish Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After hearing this, Jeremiah petitioned Jehovah for His care, saying, "O Jehovah, You know; / Remember me and visit me, / And avenge me of my persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>/ In Your longsuffering do not take me away; / Know that for Your sake I bear reproach" v. 15 . Jehovah answered with a further commission to Jeremiah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>19-21 and also by placing restrictions on Jeremiah for His further commission 16:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Finally, Jehovah gave a further statement of Judah's as Israel's sins.</S>
