<h2 class="head1">FURTHER NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">Wenchow, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>I have asked Mrs. Yuen to send you X dollars. This amount was received from the offering box designated for brothers and sisters in difficulty. Please distribute it according to the Lord's will. Peace to you in the Lord!</p><p>Brother in the Lord, Chang Gao-lai, August 24</p><h2 class="head2">Ku-Ling, Kiangsi Province</h2><p>Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>I received the few letters you sent me. Please excuse me for not answering right away. I also received Issue No. 10 of The Open Door. Thank the Lord that we can still have the Lord's message at this time. We are all safe. Originally, we intended to leave Lu-Shan, but we did not move because we have elderly and young ones in the family and have not decided where to go. May the Lord lead us. Sister Hu has left, and someone from Nan-ch'ang told us that she has gone to Nan-ch'ang. But we have not received a letter from her. Please pray for her. Peace to you in the Lord. Greetings to Brother Chang Yu-zhi, and please greet the brothers and sisters in the Lord for us.</p><p>Brother Yu Shin-liang, September 7</p><h2 class="head2">Ding-Si, Kansu Province</h2><p>I read Issue No. 7 of The Open Door yesterday and was encouraged by Brother Chang Yu-zhi's translation of The Dynamics of Service by Paget Wilkes. May God bless this book for the benefit of many. Enclosed please find stamps in the amount of X dollars for publication expenses. Please send one copy to B. R. Hallgren of the Gospel Hall in Jin-Yuen, Kansu, and one copy to John Chang of the Gospel Hall in Ding-Si, Kansu. May God bless your work for Him.</p><p>In Christ, John Chang, August 8</p><h2 class="head2">Hue-Ning, Kansu Province</h2><p>Dear Ms. Yu:</p><p>I have received all the issues of The Open Door and have obtained much help from the news of the brothers and sisters in all the different places. Thank the Lord that His work can still be so prevailing under the present circumstances.</p><p>The condition of the churches in the northwest has improved recently. Some of the Chinese brothers in the China Inland Mission adopted the policy of self-propagation and began pioneering evangelism in Ching-Yang last year. Suh Siu-deh, who loves the Lord, is taking responsibility there. Last winter some brothers and sisters from Kaifeng, who were zealous for the Lord and who were from the Methodist Bible School, established an evangelistic band and intended to go to the northwest to preach the gospel. Lately, the Assembly of God has been very active. It has a little evangelistic band working in the northwest and has done some lasting work in many areas in Tsinghai. Our respected Brother Witness Lee went to the northwest once last year. Many who desired to see him for years were unable to see him. There are still many in Sian and Lan-chou who would like him to come again with the Lord's full gospel and edify the brothers in the northwest. Mr. Liang Bin-yu was in Hue-Ning in July, and he obtained his missionary passport for working in the northwest from Lan-chou on the fifth. There are only one or two churches with a few dozen people in each between Lan-chou and Di-Hwa, a distance of a few thousand miles. If Brother Chao Yung-chuen has a burden in his spirit for the gospel work in Sinkiang, we would very much respect it, because there is a great need for men to go there. The church in Hue-Ning is absolutely the Lord's. But there are many things which we do not understand as far as the way is concerned. Although we were helped by the books Rethinking Our Work and The Open Door, they are not enough. May some writings that can render us more help be published. May God give you deep wisdom so that thousands of people may receive the benefit. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Brothers in Hue-Ning: Sun Fuh-ji, Jacob Chang,<br />Xing Ling-shuen, and Chang Ying-tien, August 10</p>
