BOTH THE PILLAR OF CLOUD<br />AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE BEING THE GLORY AS<br />THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD&rsquo;S PRESENCE<br />WITH HIS REDEEMED</h2><p>Israel, God&rsquo;s redeemed, had God&rsquo;s leading and guidance in the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire all the way from their going out of Egypt and their crossing of the Red Sea to their journeying in the wilderness. After the setting up of the tent of meeting, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle (Exo. 40:34-35). The cloud was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys (v. 38). This indicates that the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire are the glory as the manifestation of God&rsquo;s presence with His redeemed.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Appearing as a Pillar of Cloud<br />for Covering by Day</h2><p>God was with the children of Israel day and night, never departing from them. In the day God&rsquo;s presence appeared as the pillar of cloud to cover and shelter them. Today He is the same to us, the believers. The Spirit of God as the pillar of cloud is the economical Spirit to be poured upon us, to fill us outwardly, for our work and move (Acts 1:8; 2:17). First Peter 4:14 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.&rdquo; The Spirit of God covers and shelters us all the time everywhere as the pillar of cloud, bringing to us God&rsquo;s intimate and glorious presence.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Appearing as a Pillar of Fire<br />for Shining by Night</h2><p>When the dark night descended on them, the pillar of cloud that covered God&rsquo;s redeemed in the daytime became the pillar of fire to give forth light to shine over them (Exo. 40:38). This shining light comes mainly from the Word of God. The glory as the manifestation of God&rsquo;s presence is not only in His Spirit but also in His Word (2 Pet. 1:19). The word of the Scripture as God Himself is like a pillar of fire in the night to us. It conveys the light of life to shine in our darkness, leading us to walk in God&rsquo;s way of light.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE PILLAR OF CLOUD AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE<br />BEING NOT ONLY FOR GUIDANCE BUT ALSO<br />FOR PROTECTION AND FIGHTING</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Protection</h2><p>When the children of Israel went out of Egypt boldly, Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, made ready his horses and chariots and took his army with him to pursue them and, eventually, arrived at the place of their encampment. &ldquo;And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. And the cloud was there with the darkness, yet it gave light by night to them. Thus one did not come near the other all night&rdquo; (Exo. 14:19-20). This shows us that the cloud and the Angel of God, who is the very God Himself, moved together to protect God&rsquo;s people. Furthermore, the pillar that protected the children of Israel was like a wall of separation that separated the two camps. On the side of the Egyptians there was darkness, but on the side of the Israelites there was light. This pillar of cloud, a pillar that gave light, not only guided God&rsquo;s people but also protected them from the hand of the Egyptians.</p><p>On our way of following the Lord, the light which we receive from the Lord through the Spirit and the Word first guides us. Then when opposition rises up against us, the guiding light becomes the protecting light to save us from the persecution and attack of the opposers. As long as we are guided by the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire, even if we are opposed, we are still in the light, but the opposers are in darkness. Consequently, the opposers will perish, but we will be completely unharmed.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 3, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
