   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. As a Servant, Even as a Slave</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our practical service should be as a servant, even as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is according to Matthew 20:26-27.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The great ones among us should be slaves to others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At least we should be servants to serve others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>V. THE EXAMPLES OF SUCH SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this lesson we want to give three examples of such service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. The Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus said that He came not to be served but to serve, to minister Matt 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He served us even by giving up His life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that we even have to die for the brothers if there is the need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to lay down our lives for the brothers 1 John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus is the example to us of serving the brothers even at the cost of our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Epaphras</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the book of Colossians Paul mentioned Epaphras twice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul said that he was "a faithful minister of Christ" on behalf of the saints 1:7 and one who was always struggling on their behalf in his prayers 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A faithful minister is a faithful servant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Epaphras went to Paul from Colossae, and came back from Paul to Colossae to serve the saints there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A minister of Christ is not only a servant of Christ, one who serves Christ, but a serving one who serves others with Christ by ministering Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. Tychicus</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Colossians 4:7 and Ephesians 6:21 Paul spoke of Tychicus as a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow slave in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These verses indicate to us that in the early days some of the brothers served the church full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, they would not have been able to travel as extensively as they did.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In ancient times to travel by boat from one place to another could have taken a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It took them a long time to go to a certain place and return, so surely they were serving the saints and the churches full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should point out that there was such a unique and special characteristic of the church life in the ancient days.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church life is not an organization in which people are hired and fired.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church life is a matter of love toward the Lord and toward the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because some of the dear saints loved the Lord, loved the church, and loved the saints, they served others at the cost of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the early part of the nineteenth century, there was this kind of situation among the so-called Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why they were considered as the fulfillment of the church in Philadelphia, the church of brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The service that builds up the church must be like this.</S>
