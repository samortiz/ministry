	 <h2 class="head1">THE NATURE OF GOD&mdash;HOLY</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You shall be holy because I am holy&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:16; see also Lev. 11:44-45; 20:7; Heb. 12:14).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s nature is not only holy; it is holiness itself. In chapter 8 we saw that to be holy is to be separated from everything. To say God&rsquo;s nature is holy is to say God&rsquo;s nature&mdash;God&rsquo;s essence&mdash;is separated from everything else. Because God&rsquo;s nature, His essence, is holy, He wants us to be holy, to be separated from everything other than Him. If we are not holy as He is holy, we cannot see Him or come near to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPRESSION OF GOD&mdash;GLORY</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The glory of Jehovah settled on Mount Sinai&rdquo;</strong> (Exo. 24:16; see also Ezek. 1:28; 3:23).</p>
<p>God Himself is glory. There is always an appearance of glory when God manifests Himself to man. The glory of God is equal to the God of glory. Moses and the children of Israel saw the glory of God settling on Mount Sinai, and Ezekiel saw the glory of God. When they saw the glory of God, they saw God Himself. When they were before the glory of God, they were before God Himself.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;They exchanged their glory / For an image of an ox that eats grass&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 106:20; see also Jer. 2:11; Rom. 1:23; John 12:41; Acts 7:55; Heb. 1:3).</p>
<p>Jeremiah 2 says that the God of Israel was the glory of Israel. Man replaced God with idols, but Psalm 106:20 and Romans 1:23 both say that man replaced God&rsquo;s glory with idols. Therefore, these few portions show that the glory of God is God Himself. The glory of God is God Himself, especially when He appears to man (John 12:41; Acts 7:55). The Lord Jesus is the expression of God, so He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory (Heb. 1:3). Every person, event, or object that manifests God expresses God&rsquo;s glory. The phrase <em>give glory to God</em> means to express God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NAMES OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In the Old Testament (Hebrew)</h2>
<h2 class="head3">God</h2>
<p>This is the first name in the Bible. It has the following variations.</p>
<h2 class="head4">El</h2>
<p><em>El</em> is translated into English as &ldquo;God.&rdquo; It is singular and denotes God the Mighty One. It is first used in Genesis 14:18.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Eloah</h2>
<p>Eloah also is translated into English as &ldquo;God.&rdquo; It is singular and denotes God as the almighty One who should be worshipped. It is first used in Deuteronomy 32:15 and 18.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Elohim</h2>
<p>The name <em>Elohim</em> is plural and means &ldquo;the Mighty One.&rdquo; It is first used in Genesis 1:1.</p>
<p>The following names are compound names containing <em>El.</em></p>
<h2 class="head4">El Shaddai</h2>
<p><em>El</em> means &ldquo;the Mighty One,&rdquo; and <em>Shaddai</em> comes from the Hebrew word meaning &ldquo;breast&rdquo; or &ldquo;udder.&rdquo; This divine title reveals that God is the Mighty One with an udder, that is, the all-sufficient Mighty One. It is first used in Genesis 17:1. In English it is translated as &ldquo;the All-sufficient God.&rdquo; <em>Hymns,</em> #671 speaks of this name. With respect to this name, God is like a mother who nurses her infant at her breast. He is complete and sufficient.</p>
<h2 class="head4">El Elyon</h2>
<p><em>El Elyon</em> means &ldquo;the preeminent Mighty One.&rdquo; It is first used in Genesis 14:18. In English it is translated as &ldquo;God the Most High.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">El Olam</h2>
<p><em>El Olam</em> means &ldquo;the Eternal Mighty One.&rdquo; It is first used in Genesis 21:33. In English it is translated as &ldquo;the Eternal God.&rdquo; This name denotes that God is the mysterious God throughout the ages. Psalm 90:2 speaks of God as being &ldquo;from eternity to eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">Jehovah</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah</em> means &ldquo;He who is, who was, and who is coming,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the One who existed, exists, and will exist eternally.&rdquo; It means that God eternally is and will not change; He has existed from eternity. He eternally exists, and He will not cease to exist (Exo. 3:14-15; Rev. 1:8). In the New Testament the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am&rdquo; (John 8:24, 28, 58), which refers to the name <em>Jehovah.</em> The name <em>Jehovah</em> is included in the following ten compound names.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-&lsquo;osenu</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-&lsquo;osenu</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah our Maker&rdquo; (Psa. 95:6).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-jireh</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-jireh</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah will provide&rdquo; (Gen. 22:13-14).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-ropheka</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-ropheka</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah who heals you&rdquo; (Exo. 15:26).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-nissi</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-nissi</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah is my banner&rdquo; (Exo. 17:15).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-meqaddishkem</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-meqaddishkem</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah who sanctifies you&rdquo; (Exo. 31:13; Lev. 20:8; 21:8).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-shalom</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-shalom</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah is peace&rdquo; (Judg. 6:24).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-ro&lsquo;i</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-ro&lsquo;i</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah is my Shepherd&rdquo; (Psa. 23:1).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-tsidqenu</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-tsidqenu</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah our righteousness&rdquo; (Jer. 23:6).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-shammah</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-shammah</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah Is There&rdquo; (Ezek. 48:35).</p>
<h2 class="head4">Jehovah-tsebaot, or Jehovah-sabaoth</h2>
<p><em>Jehovah-sabaoth</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah of hosts&rdquo; (1 Sam. 1:3; Jer. 2:19).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Lord</h2>
<p>This name has a singular form and a plural form.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Adon</h2>
<p>This name is translated into English as &ldquo;Lord.&rdquo; It is singular and means &ldquo;master.&rdquo; It is first used in Exodus 23:17.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Adonai</h2>
<p>This is the plural form of the name <em>adon,</em> and it also means &ldquo;master.&rdquo; It is first used in Genesis 15:2.</p>
<p>In general three different names are used in the Old Testament to refer to God. The first is <em>God,</em> the second is <em>Jehovah,</em> and the third is <em>Lord. God</em> emphasizes His power, especially in creation, and <em>Jehovah</em> emphasizes His relationship with man. <em>Jehovah</em> is first used in Genesis 2:4 where it speaks of God in relation to man. The compound names based on Jehovah show further aspects of His relationship with man. The simple meaning of this name is &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; He is everything to man. Whatever man needs, He is. In His name, it is as if there is a blank after &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; which can be filled in by faith with whatever man needs. If a man needs healing, Jehovah can be his healing. If man needs peace, Jehovah can be his peace. Whatever man needs, Jehovah can provide. He is like a blank check that can be filled in with whatever man needs. This name is so precious and sweet to us!</p>
