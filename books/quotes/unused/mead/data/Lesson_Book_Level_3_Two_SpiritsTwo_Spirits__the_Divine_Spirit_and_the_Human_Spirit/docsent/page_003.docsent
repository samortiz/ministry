   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE A. A People to Express God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to Ephesians 3, in eternity past God planned to work Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His eternal purpose is to have a people with Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God will be within them and they will be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This people will be the Body of Christ to express God Himself in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First they are the church and eventually the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. Man Being Made in God's Image</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible tells us that in eternity past there was only God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then He purposed to have a Body for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this He created the universe and then man, the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man, Genesis 1:26 tells us, was made in a specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was made in God's image and according to His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why was it that God made man in His own form?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was because God intended that one day He would enter man to make man His container, with Himself as the content.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the very beginning, then, from the time of man's creation, the preparation was made for man to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE WAY GOD FULFILLS HIS ETERNAL PURPOSE A. God's Economy Oikonomia</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way in which God fulfills His eternal purpose is His "economy."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The economy of God is to dispense Himself into His chosen, predestinated, and redeemed people as their life, their life supply, and their everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have spent much time to study the Greek word for economy or dispensation used in Ephesians 1:10; 3:9 and 1 Timothy 1:4 oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This Greek word is a compound word made up of oikos, meaning house, and nomos, meaning law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you trace the root of this word, it goes back to a word that refers to the parceling out of food, the distributing of food as in parcels.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This root word also means to distribute food to the cattle for grazing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is God's economy to parcel Himself out to us as our life and as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. God's Dispensing of Himself to Produce the Body</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God's economy He dispenses Himself into His people as life, as life supply, and as everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He dispenses Himself as their strength, their power, their wisdom, their righteousness, their holiness, their love, their kindness, and even as their attributes and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Out of this economy many believers are being produced to be the components of the Body of God's Son for a full expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is our vision concerning God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>GOD AS THE SPIRIT REACHING MAN A. The Way God Can Enter into the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In what way could the infinite God be dispensed into man?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father by Himself cannot reach us, nor can the Son by Himself enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Father is unapproachable 1 Tim 6:16 , but the Son came to tabernacle among us John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But still He was not able to enter into us because He was blood and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a man with a physical body He was able to be among His disciples, but not within them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So He told His disciples that He had to die and to be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By His death and resurrection His form was changed from a physical form into a spiritual form.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He became the pneumatic Christ who was able to enter into His disciples John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the reaching of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Triune God reaches His redeemed people, He is the Spirit.</S>
