   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. TWO MEN, TWO ACTS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TWO RESULTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Romans 5:12-21 we have two men, two acts, and two results.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This passage is difficult to remember because everything in it transcends our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By nature, we do not have the concept that is revealed in this passage of Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we did, we would easily be impressed with Paul s thought.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Have you ever thought that in the whole universe there are only two men?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, in the eyes of God there are just two men Adam and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We ourselves are nobodies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are all included in either the first man or the second.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything depends on where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you are in Adam, you are a part of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are in Christ, you are a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Fifty years ago I was in Adam, but today and forever I am in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A. Two Men 1.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Adam</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Adam was the first man 1 Cor 15:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was not only the first man, but also the first Adam 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Adam was created by God Gen 1:27 , and had nothing of the divine nature and life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was merely God s creation, a work of His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is the second man 1 Cor 15:47 and the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What does it mean to say that Christ is the second man and the last Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It means that Christ is the last man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After Him, there is no third man, for the second man is the last.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This excludes the possibility of a third man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not consider yourself as the third.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is the second man and the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Following Him, there is no third Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This second man was not created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is a man mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is God incarnated to be a man John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first man had nothing of the divine nature and life of God, for he was merely God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The second man is the mingling of God with His creature, full of the divine nature and life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is a man mingled with God, a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fullness of the Godhead is embodied in Him Col 2:9; John 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>B. Two Acts 1.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Adam s Transgression in the Garden</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Romans 5:14 mentions Adam s transgression, referring to Adam s transgression of eating the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After God created Adam, He placed him in front of the tree of life, indicating that Adam should partake of this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This would have enabled him to receive God s life and to live with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Adam failed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He forsook the tree of life that denoted God as life and turned to the tree of knowledge that signified Satan as the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, Adam s transgression consisted in leaving the tree of life and pursuing the tree of knowledge Gen 2:8-9, 17; 3:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The issue of the tree of life is life, but the issue of the tree of knowledge is death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that Adam gave up life and chose death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ s Obedience on the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The second act was Christ s obedience on the cross Phil 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This act of obedience, a righteous act performed by Christ, terminated the man of knowledge 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Adam brought man to knowledge, making him a man of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ, by His obedience on the cross, terminated the man of knowledge and brought man back to life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First Peter 2:24 tells us that Christ s death restored man to life, and John 3:14-15 says that Christ was lifted up on the cross in order to bring man back to life eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, the obedience of Christ on the cross terminated the fallen man of knowledge, the man of death, and recovered man back to life, making him a man of life.</S>
