   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church in the City</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Church in the House</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: Concerning the ground of the church, we have said that there should be only one church in a city, because there is only one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people, however, speak of "the church in a house," quoting the Scriptures as their basis, as being an additional unit to the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They imply that the church may possibly have several units in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What should we say to this kind of statement?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Answer: The New Testament has a total of four passages which refer to "the church in a house," that is, in a home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 16:5</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"And greet the church, which is in their house."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Their" refers to Prisca and Aquila mentioned in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here the fact is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church in Rome, like hundreds and thousands of other local churches, first started in the house of a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that the principal members of such a house were brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the same time, there were not many members in the church; therefore, they used this brother's house for their meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a historical matter, not a doctrinal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is possible to give an explanation for a doctrine, but it is impossible to give an explanation for historical events, because historical events are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Anyone who is acquainted with history knows that hundreds and thousands of churches first started in homes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the church in a certain place became the church in a certain person's house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church in Rome was the church in Prisca and Aquila's home.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Question: Some say that since Paul sent greetings to the church in Rome as well as to the church in a house, this signifies that there was not only a local church but also a church in a house.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are there not, therefore, two churches?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Answer: Let us consider the matter slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I fear that you have not listened to the word of God carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The book of Romans never speaks of "the church in Rome."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How then could the apostle have greeted the church in Rome?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The book of Romans does not present clearly in writing one greeting to "the church in Rome" and another greeting to "the church in the house."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in greeting the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila, it is implied that such a greeting is to the church in Rome, which was meeting in Prisca and Aquila's house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the church in Rome was the church in Prisca and Aquila's house.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I presume the difficulty of those who argue about the church in both the house and the locality lies in the fact that after verse 5 Paul mentions so many names.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I think all Bible expositors know that after Paul greeted the church in verse 5, he purposely mentioned several important individuals and especially greeted them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This does not mean, however, that these people were outside the church in the house, but that they were the ones inside the church in the house to whom Paul sent his particular greetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some people, besides being included in his general greetings to the church, needed special attention.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not make the mistake of thinking that since everyone is included in the general greetings to the church, it is unnecessary to add further greetings to them individually.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That is not holy affection; neither is it the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul did not do such a thing, and neither would you or I.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The proof of this is in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the greeting sent to the church automatically included everyone and it was unnecessary to greet them again by mentioning certain names, Paul should not have greeted Prisca and Aquila in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul should have greeted in verse 5 just "the church, which is in their Prisca and Aquila's house."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Should this not have included Prisca and Aquila already?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Greeting the whole church naturally includes individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, mentioning individuals in addition to greeting the church does not mean that these individuals are not of the church but members of another group.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If this were so, then Prisca and Aquila were not of the church that was in their own house!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you see the point?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul greeted Prisca and Aquila in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then in verse 5 he proceeded to greet the church which was in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If mentioning individual names in addition to greeting the church means that these individuals were not of this church and that there was another church in existence, then even Prisca and Aquila, whom Paul mentioned separately in his greeting, were not of the church which was in their own house!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fact is that the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila was the church in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church in Rome at that time was in the house of Prisca and Aquila.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just as the individuals mentioned before verse 5, such as Prisca and Aquila, were of this church, so the many individuals named after verse 5 were also of this church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, the many individuals who were not mentioned were also of this same church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In verses 10 and 11 two more houses are mentioned in which there were also the Lord's people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, Paul did not say, "Greet the church in Aristobulus's house" or "Greet the church in Narcissus's house."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only in verse 5 did Paul say, "Greet the church, which is in their Prisca and Aquila's house."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even though the whole household of Aristobulus believed in the Lord, there was only one church in Rome, which was the church that was in the house of Prisca and Aquila.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, although there were believers of the household of Aristobulus, they could not become the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although many of Narcissus's household were believers, the believers in his house could not become an independent church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There was only one church in Rome, which was the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore the Bible does not mention the church in the house of Narcissus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The household of Aquila, the household of Aristobulus, and the household of Narcissus all belonged to the church in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although these were three households of believers, there were not three churches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There was only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rome was a locality; therefore, it had only one church, which was in the house of Prisca and Aquila.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>History tells us that Rome was a very large city during the time of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But in the early days the believers in Rome were few.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because the city was large and the believers were scattered throughout the city, it was normal for Paul to add personal greetings to the greeting sent to the church in Rome, which was meeting in the house of Prisca and Aquila.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He especially mentioned, "Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers with them" v. 14 , and also, "Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them" v. 15 . These saints were scattered in places far away from each other in the city of Rome, just like the saints today in the church in Shanghai who live in the Yangshupu District or the region of Jiangwan.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But Paul told us that there was only one church in the city of Rome and that was the one in the house of Prisca and Aquila.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although they were scattered and a few brothers were together with those who lived nearby, Paul did not call them the church; Paul only called them "the brothers with them" or "all the saints with them."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only one church can exist in one locality.</S>
