   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH HIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FROM GALILEE TO JERUSALEM 16 Scripture Reading: Luke 17:1-37</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall begin to consider chapter seventeen of the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This chapter continues to speak of matters that took place as the Lord Jesus was on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning this, the record in Luke comprises much more than the record in Matthew and Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In those Gospels the record concerning the Lord s going from Galilee to Jerusalem is somewhat brief; Luke s account of this, however, is much more inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>FOUR MINOR MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After speaking in chapter sixteen on riches, the Lord goes on in 17:1-10 to cover four minor matters: stumbling others vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1-2 , forgiving others vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3-4 , faith vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>5-6 , and realizing that we are unprofitable slaves vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regarding this last point, we need to realize that we are actually not very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that no matter how much we have done for the Lord, we need to consider ourselves unprofitable slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A Word Related to the Deeds of the Pharisees</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have spent much time wondering why these four points are inserted here immediately after chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At first I could not see any connection between them and the record in the previous chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, I saw that there is a connection, and this connection is that the four points in 17:1-10 are a teaching given by the Lord to the disciples because of what the Pharisees were doing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For instance, as religious hypocrites, the Pharisees often stumbled others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one stumbles others more than a hypocritical religionist.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Being false leaders in religion, the Pharisees were continually stumbling others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While they stumbled people on the one hand, they would not forgive them on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that even though they offended others, once they themselves were offended by someone, they would never forgive the one who offended them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, these false leaders in religion did not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they had had faith, they would not have lived the way they did.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Finally, the Pharisees were proud, viewing themselves as being very useful and profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From this we can see that the teaching in 17:1-10 was given by the Lord over against the background provided by the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In these verses the Lord seems to be telling His disciples, Don t be like the Pharisees, stumbling others and yet not forgiving those who offend them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Pharisees are without faith and yet are proud of themselves, thinking that they are useful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As those who are enjoying the Lord in the New Testament jubilee, we should not stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the contrary, we should do our best to perfect, protect, and preserve others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, if we are offended by someone, we should always be ready and willing to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Luke 17:3 and 4 say, If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And if he sins against you seven times a day, and turns to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here the Lord emphasizes the need to be willing to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, in any kind of circumstance or environment, we need to exercise our faith, believing in God and trusting Him for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, although we may be somewhat useful and profitable, we should humble ourselves and not think of ourselves as being useful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, we should always consider that we are unprofitable slaves.</S>
