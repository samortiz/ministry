   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Mary s Opinion</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Mary came to the Lord at Martha s word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She reiterated what Martha first told the Lord: Lord, if You were here, my brother would not have died 11:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This also is an opinion, a complaint against the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord never argued; neither did He accept their opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They simply did not understand that as long as the Lord was present everything would be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They could not realize this, for they were very sorrowful and even weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, the Lord groaned in His spirit and was troubled 11:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did not groan over the death of Lazarus, but over the fact that not one of the sorrowful ones knew that He was the present resurrection, and He was troubled by this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the Lord asked them where they had put Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They said to Him, Lord, come and see 11:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This answer was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That opinion was the best.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the church has a problem, do not talk so much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Simply say, Lord, come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At this juncture, the Lord wept in sympathy with their sorrow over Lazarus s death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>D. The Jews Opinion</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 11:36-38 we see the Jews opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They thought that the Lord wept 11:35 because He loved Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But some questioned why the Lord could not have kept Lazarus from dying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those opinions plus the Jews ignorance of the Lord s ability to raise Lazarus from the dead caused the Lord to groan again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>E. Martha s Opinion Again</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Lord came to the tomb, He told them to take away the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once again, Martha frustrated the Lord with her opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She said, Lord, by now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he has been there 11:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She felt that there was no use in moving the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this chapter there is nothing religious, but there are many opinions standing in the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the Lord is life to the people in the church, He meets a great number of human opinions from the people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is just like His meeting the opinions of the disciples, Martha and Mary, and their Jewish friends.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>F. Opinions Belonging to</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>the Tree of Knowledge vs. the Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All opinions come out of man s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So they all belong to the tree of knowledge, which is versus the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tree of life is actually the Lord Himself for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we stay with our opinions, we are kept away from the enjoyment of the Lord as our resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When our opinions are subdued, it is easy for us to enter into the full enjoyment of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>LIFE S RESURRECTING A. Giving Life to the Dead</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord as resurrection gives life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In resurrection, this life is imparted into the dead to raise them up from death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is life s resurrecting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>B. Needing Man s Submission and Cooperation</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must see one point here.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The point is that the Lord was able to raise up Lazarus from death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, He could not do anything because He was continually frustrated by human opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was frustrated by those opinions until the time came when they were subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, Martha was subdued with a certain amount of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord has the resurrection life, the resurrection power, but it needs our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It needs our submission.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is our submission?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is simply the giving up of our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You must forsake your opinion and allow the Lord to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When He tells us, Move this stone, we should simply move it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must submit, cooperate, and coordinate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to submit to His word, cooperate with Him, and coordinate with the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why did the Lord, who was able to raise the dead, not remove the stone by Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because His resurrection power requires our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once they had removed the stone, the Lord cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>11:41-43 , and Lazarus was raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He heard the voice of the living Lord, was quickened, and was raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After Lazarus came out of the tomb, there was still the need for human cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lazarus s hands and feet were bound with the burial clothes and his face was bound about with a handkerchief.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore Jesus said to them, Loose him and let him go 11:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They had to remove the bandages from the resurrected Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They did it and the work of resurrection was completed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We too must work by cooperating with the Lord to release others from the bondage of their bandages.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the Lord raises up people from their death in the church, we need to cooperate with Him in order to release them from their earthly bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>By this kind of cooperation the church becomes the testimony of the Lord as life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord could have moved the stone from the cave and He could have removed the bandages from Lazarus, but He did not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He would rather ask us to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, before we can cooperate with Him, we must first give up our opinions and act according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the church life, we must drop our opinions, submit to the Lord s word and work, and cooperate with His resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is a serious lesson that everyone in the local churches must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Especially the Marthas and the Marys the leading ones, the responsible ones must learn to drop their opinions, submit themselves and their opinions to the Lord, and cooperate with Him and with His resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If in any local church the leaders drop their opinions, submitting them to the Lord s word, and cooperate with the Lord s resurrection power, that church will see resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is a part of the major revelation of this chapter which is the submission of human opinions and the cooperation of the lovers of the Lord with His resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord today is still waiting for an opportunity to express His resurrection power, but it is difficult for Him to obtain the submission, cooperation, and coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As leaders in the local churches, we may be busy praying and asking the Lord to do things according to our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have to drop our opinions, submit every opinion for His consideration, and cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When He asks you to remove the stone, remove it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When He tells you to do a certain thing, do it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then you will see resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You will see resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is a part of the revelation of John 11.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Most people have seen only the story of Lazarus being raised up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They have not seen the revelation in this chapter, which is that outside of religion, in the local churches, the frustration to Christ as life comes from our human opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>C. The Actual Changing of Death into Life</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>To resurrect the dead actually is to change death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The significance of this case is the same as that of the sign of changing water into wine.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As Mary s opinion in that sign frustrated the Lord s changing of water into wine, so Martha s opinion in this case frustrated the Lord s resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Once Mary s opinion was subdued, the Lord s changing power was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When Martha s opinion was subdued, the Lord s resurrection power prevailed.</S>
