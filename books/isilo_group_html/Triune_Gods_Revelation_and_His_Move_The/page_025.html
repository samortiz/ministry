The Bible is the Word of God that conveys to us God&#8217;s revelation. Most Christians know this in a general way, but they do not know how to convert the Word of God into revelation. Even more, they do not know how these revelations can become visions to us for us to move with God. The Bible presents stories to us which are full of facts. We should not merely read the stories, but get the facts. Matthew 1 presents the genealogy of Christ, showing the coming of Christ to mankind. We must see this fact as a basis in order to see the revelation and the vision from Christ&#8217;s genealogy. I have done my best in this message to simplify the facts of the New Testament into fifteen categories. These fifteen main categories are the fifteen facts which are the real content of the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>I. THE FACTS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Incarnation</h2><p>The first category of the New Testament is that God was incarnated to be a man in the flesh (John 1:1, 14).<h2 class=head2>B. Human Living</h2><p>Second, the man Jesus experienced human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years. This man is a God-man. God as a man experienced the human life. He was God, yet He became a man to live as a man for thirty-three and a half years.<h2 class=head2>C. Crucifixion</h2><p>Jesus was crucified to accomplish God&#8217;s redemption for man (Matt. 27:33-50; Eph. 1:7; Heb. 9:12). After thirty-three and a half years of human living, Jesus died on the cross to do one marvelous thing, that is, to accomplish God&#8217;s redemption according to God&#8217;s economy for man.<h2 class=head2>D. Resurrection</h2><p>Christ resurrected from among the dead on the third day after His crucifixion (Matt. 28:1-7; Acts 10:40; 1 Cor. 15:4b).<h2 class=head2>E. Breathing the Spirit into His Believers</h2><p>In the evening on the day of His resurrection the resurrected Christ came to breathe the Spirit, whom He had become, as breath into His believers (John 20:19-22). On the same day in which He resurrected, Christ came back to His disciples. He did not teach them, but He breathed Himself into them as the breath of life.<h2 class=head2>F. Ascension</h2><p>After Christ breathed Himself as the breath into His disciples, He ascended to the heavens, was enthroned, and received the crown of glory (Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9; 2:33; Heb. 2:9); He has been made Lord, Christ (Acts 2:36), the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5), and the Savior (Acts 5:31), and also has been established by God to be the Minister of His new covenant (Heb. 8:2), the High Priest (Heb. 2:17; 4:14; 7:26; 8:1), and the Mediator and guarantee of the new covenant (Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 7:22). The things which transpire with the ascended Christ in the heavens are much more than what transpired with Him on earth. He was qualified to be such a man because He was God becoming that man. That was the unique qualification of Jesus. Who was Jesus? He was God! In His ascension He was enthroned, crowned, appointed, and established to be many items with many statuses.<h2 class=head2>G. Pouring Out the Holy Spirit</h2><p>In His ascension the ascended Christ poured out the Holy Spirit as a violent wind upon His believers (Acts 2:1-2). After He was appointed, anointed, to be many items, the first thing He did was to pour out the Spirit upon His believers as the power from on high, as the violent wind. The Spirit as the gentle breath was given to the disciples in the night of His resurrection, but on the day of Pentecost, He poured out the Spirit of power upon them. This Spirit is nothing less than the Triune God upon His believers to empower them to carry out what Christ wants them to do.<h2 class=head2>H. Sending Out the Apostles and Disciples</h2><p>After He poured out the Spirit of power upon His apostles and disciples, Christ sent them out to different places to preach the gospel and establish churches.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Triune God's Revelation and His Move &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
