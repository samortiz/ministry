The Positive Aspect</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. As God's Living Testimony<br>to Minister the Living God to His Seekers</H2><P>As God's living testimony the law functions to minister the living God to His seekers (Psa. 119:2, 88). If we regard the law only as letters, the law will be very negative to us. However, if we regard the law as God's testimony, as a portrait of God, and if we consider that every word of the law is something breathed out by God, then to us the law will be the living and loving word of God.

The Judaizers, who were zealous for Judaism, were a damage to the Lord Jesus in the Gospels, to the apostles in the Acts, and to the believers in the Epistles. Paul, before he was saved, was a strong Judaizer. In Philippians 3:2 Paul referred to the Judaizers as "dogs" and "evil workers," saying, "Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_301.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_303.html">Next</a> </body></html>
