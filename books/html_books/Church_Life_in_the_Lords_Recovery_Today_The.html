The church life mainly involves worshipping God, meeting, preaching the gospel, serving God, and working for the Lord. The entire New Testament does not present these matters in sequence in a systematic way. Rather, the New Testament record is according to the spiritual need; that is, it takes the spiritual need as the center, revealing a certain matter when it speaks of the spiritual need for that particular matter. Therefore, when the New Testament speaks of spiritual matters such as how to meet and how to serve God, it brings out their practical aspects but does not clearly point out their details all at once. For example, when Paul uses the term priest of the gospel of God in Romans 15:16, he does not specifically elucidate it; rather, he merely brings it up in passing in connection with the spiritual situation. Because of this, many have read the Bible throughout the centuries, but not many have seen the significance of the term priest of the gospel of God. There are many other similar cases, in which the Bible mentions a certain matter without giving a particular explanation for it. Hence, when we come to explore these matters, we need to take the view of the entire Bible. Unless we take this view, when we come to the matter of how to serve God in preaching the gospel, we may never realize that we who preach the gospel are all priests of the gospel of God.<p>Because the record in the New Testament is often spiritual, it is difficult for us to be clear concerning the way to practice certain matters. This is not to say that the presentation in the New Testament lacks clarity; it is to say that it is not easy to discover in the New Testament the way to practice certain matters. Therefore, throughout the centuries those who love the Lord and desire to serve God have encountered problems when studying the Bible. This is one reason why the way to practice the church life has stirred up many arguments and debates among Christians in the past nineteen hundred years and has even led to divisions. This is very regretful.<h2 class=head1>ERRONEOUS TEACHINGS BRINGING IN UNSCRIPTURAL PRACTICES</h2><p>Because not everyone has received sufficient light from the New Testament, some unscriptural practices have been brought into the church life. For example, there are many different practices of baptism. Because no plain regulations are given in the New Testament concerning this matter, there have been endless arguments throughout the centuries concerning how to baptize people and how many times to baptize them. Because there were so many arguments, many became confused, and consequently, some unscriptural practices were gradually brought in. Such situations happened again and again, especially in the degradation of the church. The only way to understand the Bible is to trust in the Holy Spirit. However, due to the church&#8217;s degradation, the degree of relying on the Holy Spirit was greatly reduced; thus, many practices that are not found in the Scriptures were brought in.<p>The matter of the eldership is another example. In the New Testament, elder and overseer are synonymous terms referring to the same person (Acts 20:17, 28). However, in the second century a teacher by the name of Ignatius introduced an erroneous teaching, saying that an overseer is higher than an elder. He then appointed overseers as bishops over a district to rule over the elders of the different places within that district. This extreme error resulted in the formation of a hierarchy. This teaching is also the source of the episcopal system of ecclesiastical government. Later, after gradual development, there were not only the bishops who governed a district but also the archbishops who mostly governed a country. Then, on a higher level, there were the cardinals who surround the pope to rule over the Catholic Church on the whole earth. They are the &#8220;cabinet members&#8221; of the pope, and if the pope dies, they elect a new pope from among themselves. The pope, of course, is the highest bishop. Besides the Roman Catholic Church, the Episcopal Church is also governed by the episcopal system. Although the presbytery system of the Presbyterian Church is not as strict, the principle is the same with them.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES</h2><p>Despite the church&#8217;s degraded condition, there have been a few since the second and third centuries who have loved the Lord with a pure heart and who have recovered the Lord&#8217;s truths. Such a recovery has been gradual and has been continuing throughout the past centuries. The most evident example occurred in the 1500s when Martin Luther recovered the truth concerning salvation through justification by faith. Then in the 1600s the Lord raised up a group of people in the Catholic Church who particularly pursued the matter of life; they were the &#8220;mystics&#8221; who stressed the inner life. After another century, in the 1700s, the Lord raised up Zinzendorf, who recovered the oneness in the church life and thereby ushered in a tremendous blessing. In the 1800s the Brethren in England were raised up; they brought in a much clearer and deeper recovery of the church life. However, the good condition among them did not last long, and they faded away at the end of the last century.<h2 class=head1>THE CONTINUAL ADVANCE OF THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY AMONG US</h2><p>In the beginning of this century, after 1920, the Lord&#8217;s recovery turned from Europe and America to the Far East. Church history tells us that when God could not find virgin soil for the church life, He came to the pagan land of China to raise up the church. In the beginning we mostly adopted the ways of the Brethren in our practice, but later we found that in many aspects of the truth they had not entered into the depths of the spiritual significance of the Bible. Brother Watchman Nee, who was the most advanced and who had the most revelation among us, saw many new things from the Bible, and he put what he had seen into the book The Normal Christian Church Life. From then on, he saw new things again and again. Every time he saw something new, that became a turn to him. At first, he practiced a certain way, but after he saw something new, he would make a turn, a change. Then after another few years, he would change again. Because of this, people could not understand him, and some even condemned him. However, concerning this matter, Brother Nee&#8217;s reply was that we are in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, and the Lord&#8217;s recovery is gradually advancing. Every time there is an advance, spontaneously there will be a turn. If we never make a turn or a change in a certain matter from the beginning to the end, it proves that we have probably fallen from the Lord&#8217;s way in that matter.<p>This is the mistake made by the denominations in Christianity. Those in the Baptist denomination saw the truth concerning baptism and stopped there. Until this day they have not advanced, nor do they want to have any change. Yet, after them, the Lord still had something more to recover. Then the Presbyterian denomination appeared when there were some who saw the truth concerning the administration of the church by the elders, the presbytery. They were right, but they remained there and were not willing to make any further turns. All the denominations are in this condition. Finally, the Brethren also had the same weakness. Because of this, Brother Nee was in fear and trembling before the Lord about this matter. He was afraid that we would be the same, that we would be content with seeing a small aspect of the truth and not be willing to receive more light, supposing that if we made a change which was not in accordance to what we had seen originally, then our new discovery was not the truth. Of course, the truth in the Bible can never change, but how the saints and the church follow the Lord&#8217;s truth, and to what extent they follow, changes depending on the amount of light they have seen concerning the truth. The more truths we see and the more light we discover, the more we will make a turn and will advance.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH LIFE GRADUALLY COMING TO A STANDSTILL</h2><p>By 1984, we in the Lord&#8217;s recovery definitely saw His blessing; eight to nine hundred churches had been raised up on the whole earth, spreading the Lord&#8217;s recovery over the six continents. In spite of this, there were two conditions, two big shortcomings, among us. One condition was that our inner life was not sufficiently strong, living, or fresh, showing that we were in a half-dormant state. The churches both in the West and the East in general were in this same condition. At that time, I mostly stayed in the United States, where there were approximately one hundred churches, but the spiritual condition there was not high. As for the East, I have had a deep relationship particularly with Taiwan, and I was very familiar with the condition of the churches there. Their condition was about the same as that of the churches in the West in that they also were not high enough. This was the inward aspect.<p>Another condition, the outward aspect, was the slow increase of the number of believers. Because of the literature work in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, churches had been raised up in the six continents. The number of churches had increased, but the number of believers had not increased much. In those fifteen years, the annual rate of increase of the believers in the churches in the United States was only two to three percent. In general, this was the condition of the churches in both the East and the West-the rate of increase of believers was very low. This matter was irrefutable evidence indicating that we had a problem, which I gradually began to detect. Not only did we detect this problem, but the large denominations also discovered that they had the same problem. In the past few decades, the increase of the number of believers has been declining. Although our numbers did not decrease and even slightly increased, the rate of increase was neither high nor fast enough.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH LIFE TODAY</h2><p>Since October 1984, we have spent much time to delve into this problem. Today I can testify to all the brothers and sisters that within these four to five years the Lord has definitely shown us many precious revelations. These revelations mainly comprise four major items, all of which we had not seen so clearly, or perhaps not seen at all, prior to 1984.<h2 class=head2>The Recovery of the Service of the New Testament Priests of the Gospel</h2><h2 class=head3>Preaching the Gospel Being a Work of the Priests of the Gospel</h2><p>The first item is that we are priests of the gospel. We know that the believers should all preach the gospel, and we may say that the brothers and sisters in every place have endeavored to preach the gospel. We cannot deny, however, that our gospel preaching has not been so powerful, and the results have been unsatisfactory to us. Very few of the saved and baptized ones have remained after the gospel preaching. Many churches among us began with only ten to twenty people; after several years, they increased to about seventy to eighty people and then gradually to one hundred. Once the number in a church exceeded one hundred, the rate of increase became very low. For the following few years, the number would constantly remain one hundred plus a few dozen. We zealously preached the gospel, yet we did not investigate thoroughly to see why the results of our gospel preaching were not ideal and why not many people remained after we had baptized them. Instead of investigating the reasons for our being in such a condition, we simply continued to preach the gospel in a routine way.<p>At the present time, after spending four to five years to study this problem, we have come to the conclusion that in the past we did not see that the preaching of the gospel is a work of the priests of the gospel. In the past, our concept and our feeling were merely that since we are believers we should love the Lord and lead others to salvation. Over time, this kind of concept or feeling did not increase our sense for gospel preaching, nor did it develop our spiritual faculties for us to minister as the New Testament priests of the gospel. Although we preached the gospel, we did not have the sense that we are priests of the gospel. A priest is one who specifically takes care of the matters pertaining to the service of God. For example, in the meetings we have the piano service, which we may speak of as the &#8220;priestly service of piano playing,&#8221; and those who serve in piano playing may be called the &#8220;piano-playing priests.&#8221; In Chinese, the service to God is called &#8220;the priestly service of sacrifice,&#8221; and those who serve are called &#8220;the sacrificing priests.&#8221; Since we, the New Testament believers, are the priests of the gospel, we are exclusively in charge of the preaching of the gospel. It is not that when we are happy, we preach a little, and when we are not happy, we do not preach at all. Whether or not we are happy, preaching the gospel is our duty, our exclusive responsibility.<h2 class=head3>The Work of a Priest of the Gospel as Seen in John the Baptist</h2><p>The revelation of the priests begins in the Old Testament. The entire Bible deals with the service rendered by God&#8217;s people to Him. God&#8217;s intention is that all His people would serve Him as priests. For this reason, in the Old Testament, God ordained that His elect, the Israelites, would all be priests so that they could be a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). Later, however, the children of Israel failed when they committed a great sin by worshipping the golden calf; consequently, they lost their priesthood. Thus, God had no alternative but to choose the house of Aaron as priests to bear the responsibility of the priesthood, and the Levites as the ones to serve with them.<p>At the beginning of the New Testament, we first see John the Baptist, who may be considered the last of the Old Testament priests. He was born into a priestly family, and his father, Zachariah, was not only a priest but also the leading priest of a priestly order. John was the only begotten son given to his father by God through the work of grace. After he grew up, he should have, according to the regulations, dwelt in the temple, eaten the priestly food, worn the priestly garments, and carried out the priestly work of offering bulls and goats as sacrifices. But he completely abandoned all these things and went into the wilderness, a place that was far away from the religious regulations and the background of civilization. He lived in the wilderness, ate locusts and wild honey, and wore a garment of camel&#8217;s hair. Furthermore, it seems that the work he did was also something &#8220;wild&#8221;; he preached, saying, &#8220;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&#8221; (Matt. 3:1-4), and then he put the repenting and confessing ones into the water.<p>What John the Baptist did indicates a basic turn and change from the service of God in the Old Testament to that of the New Testament. In the Old Testament there was a system for the service of God, including the great, holy temple with its magnificence and splendor, the perfect, sacrificial regulations, and the dignified, orderly priesthood. At the end of the Old Testament, by gaining John, the only son of Zachariah, who was a leading priest, God repudiated the Old Testament service and initiated a new beginning. John rejected being a priest of the Old Testament, and he turned and became the first priest of the gospel in the New Testament. The priests in the Old Testament offered bulls and goats as the primary sacrifices, which were physical, but the New Testament priests offer sinners, who have repented by believing the gospel, as spiritual sacrifices. In God&#8217;s eyes, every repenting and believing sinner is a spiritual sacrifice offered to God.<p>In his Epistle, Peter said that we, the New Testament believers, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices to God (1 Pet. 2:5). Becoming a New Testament priest who offers up spiritual sacrifices to God is the result of preaching the gospel. Hence, Peter went on to say that we are a royal priesthood, a holy nation, so that we may tell out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light (v. 9). This is to announce the salvation of God through the gospel that people may be saved to become spiritual sacrifices offered to God.<h2 class=head3>The Work of a Priest of the Gospel as Seen in the Apostle Paul</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus came out to minister after John, He did the same as John did, preaching the gospel of God everywhere and saving sinners to offer as sacrifices to God. He did not only do this Himself, but He also sent out His disciples to do the same thing. After the church appeared on the earth on the day of Pentecost, the disciples did this even more. Among them, there was an apostle who can be considered as a pattern in this matter, Paul the evangelist. He went all over the Gentile world to preach the gospel and save sinners, bringing them back to God. In Roman 15:16 he told us that, as a priest of the gospel of God, he offered to God as sacrifices the Gentile sinners saved through him. This was the beginning of the work of Paul as a priest of the gospel. After this, he nourished them that they might grow in life and present themselves as living sacrifices to God. This is what we see in Romans 12:1, which is the second step of the work of a priest of the gospel. However, Paul did not stop here. In Colossians 1:28 he said that he admonished every man and taught every man in all wisdom that he might present every man full-grown in Christ. This is also the perfecting of the saints, which he spoke of in Ephesians 4:12. The saved believers not only grow in life, but they are also perfected in every way in Christ unto maturity that they may directly do the work of the building up of the Body of Christ. This is the third step of the work of the apostle Paul as a priest of the gospel. Not only so, but in 1 Corinthians 14 he encouraged those who served God to desire earnestly that they may prophesy. To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into people for the purpose of ministering and dispensing Christ into them that they may be nourished and built up. This is the fourth step, which is also the highest step, of the work of a priest of the gospel.<p>The work of the priests of the gospel begins with the preaching of the gospel to save sinners and continues on with bringing them to grow in life, perfecting them, and enabling them to speak for the Lord. It is only when we arrive at the final stage that we can say that the work is complete. At this stage, all the saints can do what the gifted ones, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, do for the building up of the Body of Christ. This is the proper service of the New Testament believers. When the believers serve in this way, they serve as the New Testament priests of the gospel. Hence, the work of the priests of the gospel is very extensive, from leading people to salvation to nourishing and perfecting them until they are able to prophesy for the Lord that others may receive the life supply and the dispensing of Christ. As a result, every one of the saints can build up the Body of Christ. At the same time, the New Testament priests are a priesthood, in which all believers should and can participate. In 1 Corinthians 14:31 Paul says, &#8220;You can all prophesy one by one.&#8221; If a saved one has become a New Testament believer but still cannot prophesy, this shows that he has not been completely perfected in the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel and that he still has a lack. Since we are New Testament believers, we need to be perfected to such an extent that we can prophesy for the Lord to release the riches of Christ and minister Christ to others for the building up of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>Everyone Personally Preaching the Gospel to Carry Out the Service of the Priests of the Gospel</h2><p>What we have spoken here is a great matter that we have seen in the last four to five years. This clearly tells us that every New Testament believer must take the responsibility to do the specialized work of the priests of the gospel. For this reason, dear brothers and sisters, my main burden here is to show you that, since you love and seek the Lord, you must do the first step of the work of a priest of the gospel. Instead of others doing it for you, you need to carry it out personally by preaching the gospel to save sinners and offer them to God as sacrifices. This is also what the Lord Jesus said in John 15; as the branches of Him who is the vine, we must bear fruit to glorify the Father. Since we are branches, we must bear fruit. No branch can bear fruit for other branches. Fruit-bearing is not something that others can help us with by doing it for us. Today, as the priests of the gospel, we cannot be substituted; we ourselves, personally, need to preach the gospel and lead people to salvation. For this reason, in the church, those who are gifted in gospel preaching not only should go forth to preach the gospel but also should spend time to perfect other saints that they also may be able to preach the gospel as the gifted ones do. Every one of us must learn how to preach the gospel to save sinners, bearing fruit of the gospel as sacrifices to be offered to God. I believe that if we all are willing to receive this light, there will be no lack in the Lord&#8217;s recovery in the matter of preaching the gospel to save sinners. Furthermore, the number of believers among us will increase considerably. May the Lord grant us His visitation in this matter.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>EVERYONE PARTICIPATING IN THE SERVICE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Luke 19:10; Acts 1:8</h1><h2 class=head1>THE COMPLETE WORK OF THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>In the preceding chapter we saw that the work of God&#8217;s New Testament priests of the gospel, which is specifically carried out in sinners, includes four major steps. The first step is to go forth and visit people with the gospel that sinners may be saved and offered as sacrifices to God. The second step is to nourish the new believers. Saving sinners is like giving birth to babies; thus, what follows is the need to nourish and cherish the newborn ones that they may gradually grow in life. For this we need to feed the newly saved believers with the milk of the word in the Holy Scriptures that they may grow until they can present themselves as living sacrifices to God. The third step is to teach and perfect the saints. The gifted ones in the church perfect the grown-up saints for the purpose of making every one of them able to do the work that the gifted ones do, that is, the work of the building up of the Body of Christ. The fourth step, which is also the climax of the work of the priests of the gospel, is to help the perfected saints so that every one of them can prophesy. To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, speak forth the Lord, and speak the Lord into people, thereby dispensing and ministering Christ to others. This kind of prophesying is mainly not to predict but to present to others the Lord&#8217;s intention, the Lord&#8217;s gospel, and the Lord&#8217;s truths.<p>The church should have a meeting for all the saints to come together that all the saints may be perfected to speak for the Lord. This meeting should not be for one or two persons to speak and the rest to listen, but for every attendant to prophesy, to speak for the Lord. It is not that one man speaks and all the rest listen, but that all speak and all listen to one another. In this way the riches of Christ are released through every member. Regardless of how rich a person&#8217;s speaking is, it can never replace the riches released by all the members. Through all the saints&#8217; prophesying one by one, the riches that they have experienced in the church are ministered, item by item, for the satisfaction and edification of everyone. As a result, all the saints are built up through the supply of the riches of Christ to accomplish the work of the building up of the Body of Christ. These four steps of the work of the priests of the gospel are full and complete. They begin with preaching the gospel to save sinners for their regeneration, and they continue with nourishing and cherishing them and teaching and perfecting them that they may grow and mature in Christ, having the knowledge in truth and the experiences in life, so that they may speak for the Lord through the divine prophesying.<h2 class=head1>THE DEFORMED PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL CARRIED OUT BY A FEW</h2><p>Such a complete work carried out by the priests of the gospel is clearly revealed in the New Testament. However, the condition of Christianity before our eyes is not like this. Consider the first step, that is, the preaching of the gospel for people to be regenerated. Every believer going out personally to bring people to salvation as a priest of the gospel should accomplish this step. But deformed Christianity has changed this to a big gospel campaign with a gathering in which one man preaches. In this way, all the believers&#8217; spiritual and organic faculties for gospel preaching are negated. The work of gospel preaching, which should be carried out by every believer, is borne solely by one person, and the rest of the saints mostly help only in some practical matters during the big gospel meeting, such as inviting people, ushering, sitting with guests, and after the meeting, speaking with them and recording their names. Thus, the saints&#8217; direct, personal preaching of the gospel to sinners is annulled. This kind of Bible-deviating, deformed preaching of the gospel causes the saints over a period of time to form the habit of not preaching the gospel and thereby to become incapacitated in gospel preaching. If our organic faculties, whether physical or spiritual, are not exercised for a long period of time, they lose their function. We fully acknowledge that the big gospel meetings can save sinners; moreover, apparently the number of saved ones is considerably large. However, if we compare this practice with the practice of every believer preaching the gospel, there is still a great difference. According to statistics, it is rare for any Christian organization to have more than a thirty percent rate of increase of believers. This rate may not seem high, but if we can accomplish this, the result will be significant in a few years.<h2 class=head1>PERFECTING EVERY SAINT TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Let us consider this matter according to the way revealed in the Bible. If a certain locality already has some saints meeting together, they need to first love the Lord; second, they need to offer themselves to the Lord; third, they need to be revived within; and fourth, they need to be perfected. These saints need to be perfected in the truths of the gospel, such as knowing the difference between justification and sanctification, the relationship between redemption through the precious blood and salvation in life, and other matters. After this, they need to be perfected in the experience of the gospel. Through such perfecting they will know that their sins have been forgiven, that they have been justified by God, reconciled to God, and joined to the Lord. In this way they are thoroughly regenerated in their spirit and have the Holy Spirit indwelling their spirit. Then they have to walk according to the indwelling Spirit that they may be justified subjectively, sanctified, and transformed in life. After they have been fully perfected in truth and in experience concerning the gospel, they still need to be perfected in the skills of gospel preaching. Not only in gospel preaching but even in playing the piano or playing ball, we need to learn and receive instruction from a teacher. In anything we do, we get to know how to do it not by birth but by learning. First we learn, and then we know. If we do not learn or practice, we can never know how to do something. If we always preach the gospel by holding big meetings, most of the saints will just sit with the guests, have a little contact with them after the meeting, and record their names. Then when they meet someone who has a question concerning the gospel truth, they have to bring him to a handful of evangelists, since they themselves are not clear or competent enough to explain such things. This proves that the old way of gospel preaching has annulled our faculties for gospel preaching.<h2 class=head1>PREACHING THE GOSPEL MORE TO BECOME MORE ABLE TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2><p>If we were to cover our eyes with a black cloth so that we could not see anything, after a period of time our eyes would become blind. The reason for our blindness would be that we have not used our eyes. Why is it that the saints cannot preach the gospel? The reason is that they do not preach the gospel. We cannot speak, so we do not speak, and the more we do not speak, the more we cannot speak. This produces a vicious cycle that results in poverty. Conversely, although we cannot speak, we still should speak. Then, the more we speak, the more we can speak, and the more we can speak, the more we like to speak. The physical strength of an elderly man diminishes over the years. As a result, he does not like to walk. The less he walks, the slower he walks, and the slower he walks, the less he likes to walk. If this cycle continues, it will not be long before he is not able to rise up again after sitting down. For this reason he must struggle to walk, and the more he walks, the more he can walk. Consider the gospel preaching among us. Is our condition one of &#8220;the more we walk, the more we can walk,&#8221; or is it a condition of &#8220;the slower we walk, the less we like to walk?&#8221; Do we strive and struggle, or do we simply let the fallen nature take its course? Probably many of us no longer preach the gospel and have no desire to preach the gospel, considering ourselves as old branches that can no longer bear fruit. The most we may do is pray for the gospel when the Holy Spirit moves us.<p>In Colossians 1:28-29 the apostle Paul said, &#8220;Whom [Christ] we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.&#8221; Paul stayed in Ephesus for three years, where he taught the saints publicly and from house to house and did not cease to admonish each one with tears, night and day (Acts 20:31, 20). Paul labored in this way not by himself but according to the power which Christ operated in him. This operation of power, as the heavenly &#8220;motor,&#8221; supplied him continuously with the power of the resurrection life that he might carry out and fulfill his priestly ministry of the gospel.<h2 class=head1>FOLLOWING THE PATTERN OF THE LORD JESUS</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, we must see that what has been passed down by today&#8217;s Christianity is half right and half wrong. On the one hand, it has accomplished something by saving sinners; on the other hand, it has spoiled something by annulling the saints&#8217; function for gospel preaching. The New Testament tells us that we all are priests of the gospel and must personally go forth to save sinners. We all need to struggle for this. The God-ordained way for gospel preaching is not for us to invite people to come and listen but for us to go and bring salvation to people. In the Gospels, the Lord Jesus Himself was such a pattern. He desired to preach the gospel to us, the sinners, but, instead of sitting in heaven and bidding us to go there, He came down from heaven to us. He came first to seek and then to save that which was lost (Luke 19:10). He also sent out twelve disciples to pass through village after village to announce the gospel and heal the sick everywhere (9:1-6). Afterward, He also appointed seventy disciples and sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come, to find the sons of peace and reap His harvest (10:1-6).<p>One day He purposely went to the city of Jericho to seek a God-chosen yet fallen sinner, Zaccheus, and to bring salvation to his whole house (19:1-9). He also went to Samaria and sat by the well of Jacob, waiting for an immoral woman that He might give her the living water to quench the thirst deep within her (John 4:3-14). It was in this way that He went to different places to seek and save sinners. Therefore, after His death and resurrection, He charged His disciples before He ascended to the heavens that they should go and disciple all the nations (Matt. 28:19) and that, after they had received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and had been clothed with power from on high, they should go everywhere to be His witnesses, beginning from Jerusalem, then to the surrounding cities in the entire land of Judea, passing through Samaria, and spreading unto the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8).<h2 class=head1>BEGINNING THE PREACHING FROM OUR &#8220;JERUSALEM&#8221;</h2><p>In preaching the gospel we should keep the principle of beginning from our center, our &#8220;Jerusalem.&#8221; Our Jerusalem is our family and our relatives. Every one of us has our close relatives, distant relatives, colleagues, schoolmates, friends, and neighbors. These are people who are more intimate and acquainted with us. Many of them not only are not yet saved but may not even have heard the name of Jesus. Actually, when we go out to preach the gospel, there is no need to knock on new doors; it is enough to just knock on familiar doors. Our acquaintances-our family members, close relatives, distant relatives, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and schoolmates-are more than enough persons to whom we can go to preach the gospel. When we save one person or one family, that person or that family in turn has his or their acquaintances; then the gospel can spread out little by little. Whoever is saved through us will be also perfected to be like us. Those who are saved through us will go and save others by the same way they were saved. This is the proper way for us to preach the gospel. If we are willing to be faithful to this practice, we will surely bear fruit.<p>After hearing these messages, every one of us should get a notebook and write in a list the names of all the candidates for our gospel. Then we should pray for them before the Lord one by one and look to the Lord&#8217;s leading to go and preach the gospel to them. If we all are willing to do this, it is not difficult; to be sure, we can have one person saved in three to four months. This requires us to knock on the doors, not of strangers, but of our close or distant relatives, our older or younger schoolmates, our neighbors, our friends, and our colleagues. These doors are more than enough for us to knock on. Moreover, it is very easy to do this. Recently, the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses published statistics saying that they have 120,000 members in Japan, and they have gone out to visit people and have gained ten thousand people a year. They spent an average of over six thousand hours to gain one person. I am convinced that, according to the Bible, if we preach the gospel to the acquaintances around us, we do not need to spend even sixty hours; perhaps six hours are enough to bring one of them to be saved. This is not something so difficult that we cannot do it.<h2 class=head1>RISING UP TO PREACH THE GOSPEL AND BEAR FRUIT</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s recovery has been in Japan for thirty years, since 1959. The total number of saints in the whole of Japan is under two thousand five hundred. This indicates that we have not done much in our move for the gospel. From today on, brothers and sisters, we must all be priests of the gospel of God to preach the gospel to our acquaintances. If only fifty of those hearing this message gain one person to be saved every three to four months, after one year they will become two hundred and fifty. If we carry this out, the result will be considerably great. According to statistics and the present situation, our preaching the gospel in the old way has been &#8220;losing money,&#8221; and we have been making many mistakes. Therefore, I have a heavy burden to stir you up to preach the gospel. Do not consider that you are here merely to receive the supply; rather, rise up and go to preach the gospel. In this way, you will be a living person and will always bear fruit. If you bring one person to be saved in one month, yielding new fruit every month (Rev. 22:2), you will be the happiest person in the entire country. May our Christian life be a life of going forth to bear fruit. We should always preach the gospel, and preaching the gospel can never be wrong.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ORIGIN, DEVELOPMENT, AND PRACTICE OF THE OFFERING OF SACRIFICES BY THE PRIESTS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 9:22-23; John 21:15; Eph. 4:11-12; Acts 20:20, 27, 31; Heb. 10:24-25; 1 Cor. 14:26, 3-5, 31, 24</h1><h2 class=head1>THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRIESTS&#8217; OFFERING OF SACRIFICES</h2><p>In the previous two messages we saw that God&#8217;s intention is that every believer should be a priest of the gospel carrying out the complete work of the priesthood of the gospel for the accomplishing of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. Being the priests of God is a major subject throughout the entire Bible. First, in creation God created man in His image and according to His likeness that man might express Him. Second, God gave the created man the authority over all things that man might represent Him. Third, God created man with a spirit as the organ to receive and contact Him, and fourth, God put the created man in front of the tree of life that through it man might receive God as his life. If man had remained in the situation arranged by God, everything would have been perfect and there would have been no offering of sacrifices, nor would there have been a need for it. However, because man fell into sin, there was a need for God&#8217;s redemption. After that time, man could approach God and serve God only through the offering of sacrifices.<h2 class=head2>The Priests&#8217; Offering of Sacrifices in the Old Testament</h2><h2 class=head3>The Individual, Unofficial Priests</h2><p>Hence, Abel, the second generation of mankind, began to offer sacrifices to God, and through the offering of sacrifices he fellowshipped with God (Gen. 4:4). After the flood destroyed the world, Noah came out of the ark and built an altar on the new earth to offer sacrifices to God (8:20). Later, Abraham was called by God to leave Ur of the Chaldees, and, upon his arrival in the land of Canaan promised by God to him, he also built an altar to offer sacrifices to God (12:1-8). Then, according to God&#8217;s command, he offered his only begotten son, Isaac, as a burnt offering to God, and God provided a ram as the substitute for Isaac. That ram was a type of the Christ who was to come (22:13).<h2 class=head3>The Institution of the Corporate Priesthood</h2><p>Abel, Noah, and Abraham offered sacrifices to God as individuals according to their need before God, not according to an established arrangement. We may say that they all were priests, and Abel was the first priest in the Bible. However, at their time God had not instituted the priesthood, so we can say that they were merely individual, unofficial priests. When Abraham&#8217;s descendants, the children of Israel, were delivered out of Egypt and arrived at Mount Sinai, they were instructed by God through Moses to build the tabernacle according to the heavenly pattern. From that time onward, God came to the children of Israel through the tabernacle for them to contact, enjoy, and receive Him; they also could approach God and serve God through the tabernacle. For this reason, God established the institution of the priesthood. From then on, there were priests among God&#8217;s people, not individual, unofficial priests but corporate, God-ordained priests.<p>The one thing that was the most necessary for a priest in serving God was to offer sacrifices. Under God&#8217;s ordination, those who served as priests could approach God, and they also took care of the needs of His people. They constantly carried God&#8217;s people into His presence to seek His heart&#8217;s intent. Through the Urim and Thummin they received revelation from God and brought the divine revelation to God&#8217;s people. They became a group of people who were very intimate with God, who brought God to His people and brought His people into His presence. They were an indispensable link between God and His chosen and redeemed people.<h2 class=head2>Coming to the Turn in the New Testament</h2><p>Although such an institution of the priesthood in the Old Testament was ordained and confirmed by God, it remained merely a type, not the reality that God intended to obtain and attain. Therefore, God arranged for Christ to become flesh that He might fulfill all the types and turn them into reality. The New Testament shows us that God&#8217;s doings are marvelous. In the Old Testament age of the types, the last of the priests was Zachariah. In his old age he had no child; furthermore, his wife was barren and advanced in years. He petitioned God to give him a son to succeed him as priest. At that time God was going to have a turn of dispensations from a dispensation of types and vanity to a dispensation of reality and practicality. Therefore, God answered his prayer and gave him a son, who was called John (Luke 1:5-14).<h2 class=head2>The First Priest of the Gospel in the New Testament-John the Baptist</h2><p>John possessed the four characteristics given to man by God in the creation of man: having God&#8217;s image to express Him, having God&#8217;s authority to represent Him, having a human spirit to receive God, and having God&#8217;s life to live Him out. Furthermore, he had the good qualities of Abel, Noah, and Abraham of the age of individual priests, and he also inherited the arrangement of the age of the priesthood established by God. Not only so, he was a Nazarite, one who voluntarily consecrated himself to be a priest to God. He did not drink wine or liquor but was filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&#8217;s womb (Luke 1:15). He was a person who lived absolutely for God and who was qualified to serve God. It was through him that God ended the institution of the Old Testament priests and initiated the reality of the New Testament priests. God bestowed on him an unprecedented, divine, and great commission to go forth to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God to bring people to repent and be baptized that they might enter into the kingdom of God. This was not a type but a reality. Furthermore, he told people that he was not Christ, he was not the reality, but he was a voice crying in the wilderness to preach the baptism of repentance and usher in the Christ who was to come. This is the way the dispensation of Christ as the reality arrived. The kingdom of God was no longer a type but a reality, and likewise the Christ of God is not a type but a reality. When people heard John&#8217;s preaching and repented, John immersed them into water. This means that he put people into death that they might be regenerated by Christ in the position of death and be raised from death to become God&#8217;s New Testament believers, those who truly have God&#8217;s life for them to live out God. John the Baptist offered these repentant and saved ones to God. Thus, the service of the priests of the gospel of God began with him.<h2 class=head2>Christ Being the Reality of the New Testament Offerings</h2><p>After John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus came. He continued the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom of God that John the Baptist carried out (Matt. 4:17). He was the Christ of God as the embodiment of God to bring God to people. In His preaching of the gospel, He told people not only to repent but also to believe into Him and receive Him as the reality of God. After He had accomplished His gospel ministry, He was crucified and thereby accomplished an all-inclusive death, solving all the problems between God and man. Furthermore, through His redemptive death, He released the divine life. Then He was resurrected from death and imparted the divine life released by Him to everyone who believes in Him, so that all who believe in Him would be resurrected with Him to be the many sons of God. At the same time, He also became the life-giving Spirit to enter into His redeemed ones that they may be the many sons of God and the members of His Body. After accomplishing all these things, He ascended to the heavens on high and, as the all-inclusive Spirit, poured out what He had received of the Father so that all the members of His Body may receive, as He received, the power to go forth and preach the gospel as His witnesses.<p>Our gospel preaching today is mainly the preaching of such a Christ, who as the embodiment of God became the reality of God, solved all our problems through His crucifixion and resurrection, and released the divine life so that all who believe in Him may become the sons of God to express Him and the members of His Body to be presented to God. To serve God in this way is to be a priest of the gospel of God. Therefore, the work that is carried out by the New Testament priests of the gospel is still primarily to offer sacrifices. However, the sacrifices offered by the New Testament priests and the sacrifices offered by the Old Testament priests are altogether different. In the Old Testament, what the priests offered as sacrifices were bulls and goats, whereas in the New Testament, what the priests offer as sacrifices are sinners who have been saved into Christ and joined to Him. The bulls and goats as sacrifices in the Old Testament were types of Christ who was yet to come, whereas the redeemed sinners are in Christ who has now come. As such, they have become a part of Christ and are offered to God as living, spiritual sacrifices by the New Testament priests of the gospel.<h2 class=head2>The Sacrifices Offered by the New Testament Priests of the Gospel</h2><p>These living sacrifices offered to God were chosen and predestinated by God before the foundation of the world and are called out from all the nations and peoples in the New Testament age. Hence, in the New Testament age, there is the need of a group of people to execute God&#8217;s calling by going to the sinners to blow the trumpet of the New Testament gospel. They are people who can express God and represent Him and who have the life of God and live Him out. They contact God constantly and are intimately close to Him. They know God&#8217;s heart, and they live and work according to His heart&#8217;s desire. They are a group of people who can bring God to people and who can also bring people into the presence of God. By God&#8217;s life and power and through their spiritual experience, they work on all those who have been chosen and called by God that they may make them, one by one, spiritual sacrifices in Christ. They not only make God&#8217;s chosen and called ones offerings to God once they are saved, but they also nourish them and lead them to grow in life that they may present themselves as living sacrifices to God. Furthermore, they teach and admonish every man in all wisdom until they can present to God every man full-grown in Christ. Thus, after these living sacrifices have been saved, have grown in life, and have been perfected, they arrive at the stage where they can serve as priests of the gospel of God, as the other believers do, to carry out the same kind of work on those who are to be saved after them. This work of the gospel is not merely for sinners to be regenerated as the children of God, as we may have thought in the past. Rather, the work of the gospel comprises every step from a sinner&#8217;s regeneration to his maturity in Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE WORK OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL IN OFFERING SACRIFICES</h2><h2 class=head2>Nourishing the Saved Ones So That They Also Present Themselves as Living Sacrifices to God</h2><p>We have seen that the complete work of the gospel, the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel in offering sacrifices, includes four major steps. The first step is to help sinners repent and believe into the Lord and thereby be regenerated as the children in God&#8217;s family. The second step is to nourish the newborn babes. This is the feeding of the Lord&#8217;s lambs mentioned in John 21. In 1 Thessalonians 2:7 Paul said, &#8220;We were gentle in your midst, as a nursing mother would cherish her own children.&#8221; In the original language, cherishing here includes nourishing; it indicates care that is more tender than mere nourishing. Only this can keep infants from an early death. In the past, many have been baptized in the churches, but those who remained were few. The reason is that those who begot them did not feed them. If those of us who bring people to salvation feed them as lambs, according to the Lord&#8217;s word, and cherish them as Paul did, I believe that more than half of them will remain. In John 15:16 the Lord said that He chose us and set us that we would go forth and bear fruit and that our fruit would remain. For this reason, we should not only beget through the gospel, but we should also be nursing mothers to nourish and cherish the babes whom we have begotten in the Lord.<p>We know that to nourish and cherish babes is not accomplished in one or two days; it is a daily, continual work that requires a long period of time. First Peter 2:2 says that it is by the guileless milk of the word that newborn babes grow. This requires the nursing mothers&#8217; nourishing. Paul regarded the Corinthian believers as infants in Christ and gave them milk to drink, not solid food (1 Cor. 3:1-2), and he did the same thing for the Hebrew believers (Heb. 5:12). He was truly a pattern to us. If we all are willing to do this, those whom we have brought to salvation will not suffer an &#8220;early death&#8221;; rather, they will receive adequate feeding and will grow in life so that they can present themselves to God as living sacrifices. When they are first saved, we offer them to God as sacrifices, but after we have fed them, they can present themselves to God. This is the work of what we have referred to as the home meetings.<h2 class=head2>Perfecting the Saints to Present Them Full-grown to God</h2><p>The third step is to bring them to the small group meetings to be taught and perfected until they can do the work of the building up of the Body of Christ, as the gifted ones do, in preaching the gospel, nourishing, teaching, prophesying for the Lord, and even establishing churches. According to the organic practice revealed in the New Testament, the perfecting work in this step can be carried out only through the group meetings, because the work in this step requires mutuality. Hebrews 10:24-25 says, &#8220;Let us consider one another so as to incite one another to love and good works, not abandoning our own assembling together.&#8221; We believe that this refers to the small group meetings. Paul stayed in Ephesus for three years, on the one hand, ministering to the saints publicly in the meetings, and on the other hand, teaching and admonishing them from house to house. This step of the work is greatly lacking among us. In order to perfect the saints that they may all function in a full way and may be presented to God full-grown in Christ, we need to have people in the churches who do the work of teaching and perfecting in the small groups.<h2 class=head2>Leading the Saints to Prophesy That They May Minister Christ for the Building Up of the Church</h2><p>The fourth step is to work out a meeting for mutual speaking and mutual listening, a meeting in which the perfected ones can all prophesy, speaking for the Lord, speaking forth the Lord, and speaking the Lord into others. This is the most excellent matter. When someone has knowledge in truth and experience in life, and he also receives the Lord&#8217;s inspiration by his continual contact with Him, then having these three things, he can speak for the Lord, speak forth the Lord&#8217;s desire, and release the Lord&#8217;s riches. In this way, he ministers Christ&#8217;s mysteries, riches, and sweetness into others. This meets the need of all the saints so that all are edified and the church as a whole is built up.<p>This kind of meeting, a meeting for all to prophesy, has disappeared from church history for nearly nineteen hundred years. This is because it is a culminating work that requires labor. Hence, throughout the centuries the church has been afraid to touch this matter and therefore has simply evaded it. It seems that the Bible in the hands of Christians today does not have chapter fourteen of 1 Corinthians, a chapter in which Paul speaks of nearly nothing else but prophesying. He begins by saying, &#8220;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy&#8221; (v. 1). Then he goes on to say, &#8220;He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church&#8221; (v. 4). He also says, &#8220;So also you...seek that you may excel for the building up of the church&#8221; (v. 12). Speaking in tongues is a low gift since it does not minister to people or build up the Body of Christ. However, prophesying, speaking for the Lord, speaks forth His desire, releases His riches, and ministers His transcendence and sweetness to all the saints. This is the most excelling gift.<p>Who can do such an excelling thing? Paul says, &#8220;You can all prophesy one by one&#8221; (v. 31). Although prophesying is an excelling gift, God&#8217;s grace will enable us to attain it if we pursue it faithfully. We are not able, but He is able. It is not we but the grace of God (15:10). At the end of chapter fourteen, he says, &#8220;So then, my brothers, desire earnestly the prophesying&#8221; (v. 39). To this day this chapter of the divine Word has not yet been fulfilled. We believe that the Lord will recover this matter among us. He has been waiting for more than nineteen hundred years. Is today not the right time for Him to recover this chapter in the Bible among us?<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY BEING THE WORK OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL IN OFFERING SACRIFICES</h2><p>In the past, we may have heard, to some degree, something concerning the practice of the new way among us. It is very unfortunate and heartbreaking that several churches have wrongly understood the new way that has been brought in and have also spoken mistakenly about it. The new way is not door-knocking alone; it does not consist merely of knocking on doors to visit people for gospel preaching. That is only the beginning of the new way. To practice the new way is to come back to the Bible and take the way ordained by God for the New Testament priests of the gospel to carry out the work of the gospel. This way includes primarily four major steps. The first step is to personally visit people for the preaching of the gospel to lead sinners to be saved through regeneration and then to offer them to God as sacrifices. The second step is to go to the homes of the new believers to nourish and cherish them that they may grow in life so that they can present themselves as living sacrifices to God. The third step is to ask the new believers to participate in small group meetings so that they all will be helped and instructed, and so that everyone opens himself and everyone fellowships. Such opening and fellowshipping bring in mutual interceding, mutual caring, and mutual shepherding. Moreover, these small group meetings afford everyone the opportunity to ask questions concerning truth and life. During this time, no one leads the meeting or acts as the only person who answers questions, but all of the attendants answer according to the measure and depth of what each one knows. Everyone speaks a brief word and adds to the speaking of others. In less than ten minutes, seven or eight people can answer a question in a complete way so that everyone learns and everyone is taught.<p>If we have this kind of small group meeting, week after week, for fifty-two weeks yearly, how much and how greatly we will be benefited! These meetings are neither the worship services in the denominations nor the meetings among us for listening to messages. In the small group meetings there are no religious ceremonies nor predetermined programs and procedures. Instead, everyone who comes to the meeting begins the meeting while still in his home or on the way, coming with singing and praying. Whoever comes into the meeting can simply sing and pray without waiting, and when others come, he can begin to open up himself for mutual fellowship. If there is any problem or need, they simply pray for one another. In this way, spontaneously there is care and shepherding. Any question concerning truth and life can be brought out for all to answer and to teach and learn from one another so that all may be perfected. The fourth step is to help the perfected ones to be God&#8217;s prophets speaking for the Lord in the meetings, speaking the Lord into people, so that all the saints are supplied and the Body of Christ is built up. This is the culminating step.<h2 class=head1>PRESENTING OURSELVES TO TAKE THE NEW WAY ORDAINED BY GOD</h2><p>These four steps taken together constitute the new way of which we have spoken in these days, that is, the way ordained by God from the past unto eternity, which He has revealed in the Bible for us to take. I fully realize that this way does not seem convenient to many of our dear saints, but the commission that I have received from the Lord is not to speak messages that are convenient to the brothers and sisters. If so, I would have failed the Lord and cheated you. At this time I am speaking sincerely and faithfully concerning what the Lord intends to recover in us. The proper church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today is one in which every believer is a New Testament priest of the gospel. Although we all have our own occupation or business, we should still set aside an amount of time and present ourselves to go out personally for preaching the gospel and offering saved sinners to God as sacrifices. We should also go to the homes of the new believers to have home meetings that we may nourish and cherish them and lead them to grow. Moreover, every week we need to spend time to bring them to the small group meetings that they may be taught and perfected. Furthermore, we ourselves should pay the price to love the Lord, pursue to be spiritual, delve deeply into the truth, have experiences in life, always maintain the fellowship between us and the Lord, and always be ready to receive inspiration in our spirit that we may be those who prophesy for the Lord in the meetings. If we are willing to do these things, we become the genuine New Testament priests of the gospel to carry out the entire gospel work; that is, to deliver a God-chosen and called one from the position of a sinner to become a child of God and a member of Christ, and to help him to grow, be perfected, and eventually prophesy for the Lord for the edification of the saints and the building up of the Body of Christ. If we truly do this, God&#8217;s New Testament economy will be accomplished quickly, and the day of the Lord&#8217;s coming will be near. May the Lord bless us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RECOVERY OF THE ORGANIC PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</h1><p>Prayer: O Lord, we worship You that You have enabled us to see Your light and receive Your revelation. We gather here again to open ourselves to You, Lord. May You also open Yourself to us to speak again a word to us for this age, even a word which You have revealed in the Bible and ordained in eternity. O Lord, make us those who love You, who enjoy sitting at Your feet to listen to the word concerning Your heart&#8217;s desire. Lord, may You visit the church in Tokyo and all the churches in the whole of Japan that they may all receive grace and be brought into Your new way for the organic building up of Your organic Body. O Lord, be with us; as we speak for You, be one spirit with us. Speak in our speaking and seal every word with Your Spirit that we may have fresh utterance and the expression that is of You. Furthermore, resist the enemy for us and destroy the power of darkness. May Your blessing and grace be upon all the saints. Amen.<h2 class=head1>THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY BEING ALTOGETHER ORGANIC</h2><p>I am burdened concerning the God-ordained way revealed in the Bible. I believe that after the three preceding messages, we have gained considerable understanding concerning the way to worship God as revealed in the Bible and have recognized that this way greatly differs from the practice which we see in Christianity and from the way we have had in the past among us. The difference lies in the fact that the God-ordained way is altogether organic, and since it is organic, everything is a matter of the Spirit. Perhaps someone may ask, &#8220;What does it mean to be organic?&#8221; A podium is made by putting together several pieces of wood. It is organized, not organic, because it is lifeless. However, the church, the Body of Christ of which the Scriptures speak, is not organized but organic. This organic Body of Christ is signified by our human body. Our human body is constituted with many members, and everything in this body is a matter of life; everything is organic, not mechanical. When we speak, not only does our mouth speak, but in actuality, our entire being is speaking. Our hands, feet, face, and even our hair all help together. If we were robots, our mouth would move when its switch was turned on, but none of our other parts would be involved. However, when we speak, we are organic; regardless of how we speak, our entire body participates in the speaking because an organic element is present in our body. This element is the circulation of our blood. The life of our body lies in the blood; wherever the flow of blood goes, there is the organic function. On the contrary, wherever the flow of blood is stopped, the organic function is lost. People suffer a stroke or become paralyzed when there is a blockage of the blood flow. The better the circulation of blood is in our body, the healthier our body will be. Hence, our body needs a great deal of exercise to improve its blood circulation.<h2 class=head1>THE WORK OF THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL BEING ORGANIC AND FULL OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>We are living, organic beings not only because of the blood circulation in our body but also because of the transmission of oxygen in our blood. If we do not take any food for eight days or drink any water for three days, we may still live, but if we stop breathing for just a few minutes, we will die. Hence, oxygen is more important to us than water and food. If there is a sufficient amount of oxygen, the blood circulation will be normal, and the entire body will feel refreshed. Likewise, as the saved ones, we all have the essence of the Body of Christ, and that essence is the life of God. We have two lives: the human life and the divine life. Because we have the human life, we know the things in the human kingdom, and because we have the divine life, we know the things in God&#8217;s kingdom. This is our organic essence. If all day long we neither call on the Lord nor pray, we become miserable because the organic essence within us cannot operate. However, the more we call on the Lord and the more we pray, the more we feel comfortable and refreshed because the life within us is activated. Hence, we need to move in cooperation with the inner organic operation. The Holy Spirit in us is like the oxygen in our body. We must have the Holy Spirit and always be filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit and the divine life are just like the oxygen and the blood circulation that refresh us and make us healthy. Therefore, all our activities in the church must come out of the life of God in us in coordination with the Holy Spirit. This is a basic principle.<p>The work of the New Testament priests of the gospel includes four major steps: first, preaching the gospel to save sinners; second, nourishing the newly saved ones; third, teaching and perfecting the nourished saints; and fourth, leading them to prophesy, to speak for the Lord. Each of these four steps must be organic; every step must be carried out in life and through our being filled with the Holy Spirit. This is the way revealed in the New Testament. However, in today&#8217;s Christianity, all these things are not organic and are not carried out by being filled with the Spirit. They have become practices in ordinances with fixed programs and rigid procedures. Such practices in Christianity according to programs and schedules may sometimes be of life and occasionally be filled with the Spirit, because those who are doing these things are living. Nevertheless, in principle, all the activities in Christianity depend upon organizational arrangement, not upon life and the Spirit. However, in the Lord&#8217;s recovery the gospel work we do as priests of the gospel should come out of the organic essence and should be filled with the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head1>BY THE ORGANIC ESSENCE AND BEING FULL OF THE SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2><h2 class=head2>Organic Preaching of the Gospel</h2><p>In order to have the organic practice of the new way, we should have a great deal of exercise. If we desire to go out week by week to preach the gospel, we first need to decide on a time and ask someone to coordinate with us; then, when the time comes, we go out together. Doing this, however, does not mean that we are organic. Preaching the gospel is a good thing, but a good thing is not necessarily organic or filled with the Spirit. As gospel preachers, we need to pick up the burden to pray every day for our gospel contacts whose names we have listed. In our prayers, as we are moved and led by the Lord, we know to which one we should go that we may lead him to salvation. Then we should make an appointment with him and specifically pray for him, even with fasting. Meanwhile, we should find someone with whom to coordinate and pray. Then when the time comes, we are living, organic, and full of the Spirit. We do not act according to procedures or in a routine way. Instead, we go together with the same organic source and in the same move of the Spirit. When we see our contact, right away we may testify to him, saying, &#8220;The Lord is living. He is the Savior, who shed His blood on the cross for redemption. Anyone who repents and confesses his sins will receive forgiveness. Moreover, today the Lord as the life-giving Spirit desires to enter into anyone who believes and calls on Him that He may be his life and his everything. Therefore, you should open yourself and call on the Lord&#8217;s name to take Him in, just like you breathe fresh air.&#8221; As we lead him in this way to receive the Lord and be baptized, he is saved and becomes a person who has the divine life and the Holy Spirit. This is the organic gospel preaching.<h2 class=head2>Organic Nourishing and Perfecting</h2><p>If our gospel preaching is organic, full of the Spirit and full of life, people will be saved organically and will be full of the Spirit and full of life. After this, we have to nourish the saved ones; this is also organic. This is not merely to do things in the proper order; rather, it is to do everything in an organic way, being full of the Spirit and full of life. From the time we lead someone to baptism, instead of forgetting him we should pray for him every day. We should love him and cherish him as an infant to whom we have given birth. Every time we contact him, we should be in the Spirit so that he senses that he has received the life supply. We should also instruct him to pray with his spirit and enjoy the Lord&#8217;s word. Not only so, we should bring him to the small group meetings, according to the organic operation of the Body of Christ, so that he can see how the saints are living and organic when they meet together.<p>Before leaving home, everyone who attends these meetings should begin to sing and pray. Spontaneously, we all go to the meeting singing and praying. The Christian meeting is based upon prayer and singing and is constituted with the word of God and the Spirit of God as its elements. This way of going to the meeting with singing and prayer is organic, full of life and the Spirit. In such an organic small group meeting, no one comes to attend a worship service, and no one comes to lead the meeting. Everyone who comes is living and full of organic function. Hence, such a meeting does not have any fixed program or procedure; we simply follow the organic operation and act according to the Holy Spirit. There is no rigid speaking according to a prior decision. Everything is not carried out in a proper order according to prescription and arrangement with programs and procedures; this is to have a worship service in the way of the denominations. Our condition in the past was like this to some extent. Such practices are a departure from the Bible and do not correspond to God&#8217;s New Testament economy. According to the Bible, Christian meetings are not mechanical but living, not organized but organic, full of the Spirit and full of life. Only this can enable people to be supplied, enlightened, and even the more, perfected.<h2 class=head2>Organic Prophesying</h2><p>Lastly, we must reach the point where every saint prophesies and speaks for the Lord. This step is not only absent in Christianity but also, regretfully, it is lacking among us. It is something very great and high, which requires the saints to enter deeply into the truth and know the Bible well, and at the same time, to have the experience of the Lord and growth in life. To be rich in truth and to be rich in life are the basic factors. Furthermore, the saints should live a life in which they contact the Lord day by day, fellowship with the Lord moment by moment, confess their sins thoroughly, and are always filled with the Spirit. They are ready at any time to receive inspiration from God. When they open their mouth, they have the word of truth with the experience of life to speak forth the Lord and to speak the Lord into others. Their speaking is organic and of the Spirit, not mechanical or merely from their memory.<p>To be a Christian is very simple. It only requires us to be saved and regenerated and to receive spiritual nourishment, teaching, and perfecting. In this way we are sanctified and transformed by the renewing of our mind. Every day we need to be soaked with the Lord&#8217;s word and to experience the Lord. Then, whenever we are inspired and open our mouth, what we speak is the word of truth with the experience of life, full of light, revelation, and supply, speaking forth the Lord and speaking Him into people that the seekers may be satisfied, the Lord&#8217;s lovers may be supplied, and everyone who hears the word may be edified. As a result, all the brothers and sisters are built up together to be the organic Body of Christ. This is truly to reach the peak.<p>This is what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. However, it is not easy to arrive at such a point. This peak is high and the way is steep; therefore, very few are willing to spend their energy to pursue it. Christianity simply puts this matter aside, and 1 Corinthians 14 has become a chapter buried and sealed up in the Bible. However, we believe that today, in the last days of this age, it is the right time for the Lord to recover 1 Corinthians 14 among us. For this reason we have to endeavor, labor, and struggle. After we are saved and sanctified, we grow and are transformed so that we present ourselves to the Lord as living sacrifices. Then we need to go on and be perfected; we need to have mutual teaching and mutual building up with the brothers and sisters in the small group meetings. Furthermore, we need to read the word every day, penetrate the word, pray to the Lord every moment, and experience Him. We also should be those who love the Lord and fellowship with Him and who constantly have His appearing and inspiration. Thus, spontaneously, when we come to the meetings, we can right away, at the right opportunity, open our mouth to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, that the church may be built up.<h2 class=head1>BEING ORGANIC RESULTING IN MULTIPLICATION AND BUILDING</h2><p>If we are organic and are full of the Spirit and full of life in preaching the gospel, nourishing the new ones, attending the small group meetings, and prophesying for the Lord, surely our gospel will be very effective, the number of the believers will multiply, and the churches will spread and be built up. A large city such as Tokyo may be likened to a huge fishpond in that there are people everywhere who are all candidates for the gospel. It is not difficult to gain people for the Lord. Moreover, according to God&#8217;s sovereign arrangement, we still have many relatives, friends, colleagues, schoolmates, and neighbors, who are all the objects of our gospel preaching. What we need is to be organic by being according to the Spirit and being a living Christian, not being complacent or slothful, but turning from the old way back to the Bible, carrying out every step according to the God-revealed and God-ordained way. Thus, we will receive the Lord&#8217;s grace and blessing. We will grow in life, be perfected, and arrive at the stage of maturity that we may speak for the Lord.<p>Every one of us can arrive at such a condition. In Philippians 3:13-14 Paul said, &#8220;One thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward.&#8221; This is to begin with being saved, growing, being perfected, and then arriving at prophesying. If we are blessed to arrive at such a condition, even the outsiders, the unbelievers, will be saved and blessed, and the church will be built up.<h2 class=head1>BEING ASSURED THAT THE LORD WILL WORK OUT HIS RECOVERY</h2><p>This is the conclusion of what we have received in the last four or five years after reconsidering our ways before the Lord according to the Bible, by studying church history, and by comparing the statistics of numerous denominations. This is also the life that we should live, the work that we should do, and the way that we should take as God&#8217;s New Testament priests of the gospel. For this reason I am convinced that among us the Lord will first recover the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. Second, He will recover the organic essence of the Body of Christ so that every member is living, full of the Spirit, and full of life. Third, He will recover Ephesians 4 so that all the gifted ones may perfect the saints to do the work of the ministry, and fourth, He will recover 1 Corinthians 14 so that all the saints may arrive at a state in which they all speak for the Lord as prophets. I believe that the Lord will work this out for the accomplishment of His purpose. On the human side, we may have looseness and shortcomings which merely delay the Lord&#8217;s time. Furthermore, to the Lord a thousand years are like one day. However, He will eventually accomplish what He is after; He will work it out sooner or later.<h2 class=head1>BEING POSITIVE, ENDURING, AND ENDEAVORING</h2><p>We all should have much faith and maintain a heart of endurance, being hopeful in the Lord and hopeful concerning His new way. In the last days of this age the Lord will fully recover these four things among us-the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, the organic function of the believers, the perfecting in Ephesians 4, and the prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14. We need to be positive but not anxious. We all have our old background and old upbringing which are not easy to discard and replace with something new. Therefore, we should not be too hasty to have a success but should rather proceed slowly with a right heart and endurance. At the same time, those who have already entered into the new way should not despise those who have not yet entered, and neither should those who have not yet entered oppose those who have entered. We all should love one another, bear one another, and wait for one another. Do not forget that whichever way we are in, we are all those who believe in the Lord, who love Him, and who are for Him. However, it makes a difference which way we take. If we take the right way, the results will be great; if we take the wrong way, the results will be small, and this will be a frustration to the Lord. Therefore, as much as we can, we should turn to the proper way.<p>We must endeavor to go on with the Lord. The Lord knows our problems and our circumstances. He can be our supply and strength and day after day bring us to the right way. We also should consider one another and pray for one another, without criticizing, despising, or opposing, but only loving, exhorting, and supporting one another. We all should endeavor together to do our best. May every saint enter into the God-ordained way, may everyone be a priest of the gospel, may everyone preach the gospel to save sinners, may everyone nourish others, may everyone perfect others, and may everyone prophesy and help others to prophesy for releasing the riches of Christ that all may be supplied and the church may be built up.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>LIVING THE CHURCH LIFE IN THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY TODAY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Prov. 4:18; 2 Cor. 4:16; Rom. 8:4; Col. 1:29; 2 Cor. 5:10</h1><h2 class=head1>THE ORGANIC PRACTICE OF THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL ACCOMPLISHING GOD&#8217;S PURPOSE</h2><p>In the previous messages we have seen clearly that God&#8217;s desire in the New Testament is that every saved one be a priest of the gospel. First, we need to go and preach the gospel to gain sinners that they may be regenerated so that we may offer them to God as sacrifices. After this, we need to pick up the burden to go to their homes regularly to nourish and cherish them that they may receive the life supply and grow in the spiritual life until they can present themselves to God as living sacrifices. Then we need to continue to carry out in them the work of teaching and perfecting. This requires us to bring them to the small group meetings to have contact and fellowship with the saints that they may open themselves up to the saints to receive mutual care and supply. In such a small group meeting, everyone has the equal opportunity and right to open his mouth to speak, to ask questions, and to answer questions. Everyone also can teach others and be taught by others. The questions asked are mainly of two categories: one category concerns the divine truths in the Bible, while the other category concerns our Christian pursuit and growth in life. It is best to have such a small group meeting once a week. For fifty-two weeks in a year, all should come together weekly to fellowship, minister, ask questions, answer questions, teach, and learn. In this way, we can gradually enter into the knowledge of the truth and the growth in life. As a result, we will be perfected to do the same work that the gifted ones do, with all of us carrying out our respective functions for the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>In the stage of perfecting, we need to help others to exercise and learn to speak for the Lord, that is, to prophesy. This is not to gossip or speak ordinary words. Instead, this is to speak concerning Christ and to minister Christ, to speak forth God&#8217;s eternal purpose, plan, and economy, and to speak forth the proper spiritual living and the spiritual experiences which we who belong to the Lord should have. This is to prophesy according to the biblical revelation in coordination with our own experience of life and in conjunction with the instant inspiration that we receive. Hence, this kind of prophesying is organic and in the Spirit, not mechanical or according to doctrines and reasonings in letters. Such organic prophesying and spiritual speaking spontaneously minister Christ to others and release the light of truth that people may receive enlightenment and life supply. This is not limited to two or three people, but all attendants have the equal opportunity and the same right to speak. Hence, prophesying is everyone speaking and everyone listening; it is mutual speaking and mutual listening.<p>In such a meeting for prophesying, at least over half of the attendants can speak. This does not mean that the others may not speak, but because of time not everyone may have the opportunity to speak. If someone does not have the opportunity on one occasion, he can wait for the next occasion to speak, if time allows. There may be some whose speaking is not rich or strong, but there will always be some who speak in a very rich and strong way. All the speakings are needed, whether they are deep or shallow, high or low, rich or poor. This is because a church meeting is not like a class in school. In a class all the students have the same status and are at the same level, but in a church meeting there are young ones, middle-aged ones, older ones, more advanced ones, and less advanced ones. All are blended together, and even the newly saved ones are encouraged to open their mouth to speak. Everyone presents what he has received of the Lord; in this there are true riches. Furthermore, everyone can receive much supply and edification from what is spoken, heard, taught, and learned. Then, week after week, the supply that we receive will be of a great variety, and the functions in which we are perfected will be extensive. When all the saints are established, the whole church can be built up. In this way, the Body of Christ will be built up organically, and God&#8217;s desire will be realized, God&#8217;s purpose will be accomplished, and God&#8217;s eternal economy will be fulfilled.<p>The church should help the brothers and sisters in the way of visiting people to preach the gospel to save sinners, nourishing and taking care of the new believers, and teaching and perfecting them so that all can prophesy and speak for the Lord. When the church does this, sinners will be saved, believers will grow, saints will be perfected, and all will prophesy one by one. Then the church will be flourishing and the testimony will be strong. What a rejoicing this will be to us!<h2 class=head1>THE STUDY OF THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY ACHIEVING THE ULTIMATE RESULTS</h2><p>I was a Christian in the old way for fifty-five years, and I preached in the old way for fifty years. In 1984 the Lord opened my eyes to see that the old way was partially scriptural and partially unscriptural. In the last four and a half years I have seen begetting, nourishing, teaching, and building in the Bible, that is, preaching the gospel, nourishing and cherishing, teaching and perfecting, and prophesying for the Lord. In addition to seeing these things, I researched them. I set up a training center in Taipei, which in actuality was a research center, where we spent much time investigating these matters one by one. A number of saints went there to be trained, but to speak honestly, they did not receive much genuine training. What they saw was merely a small amount of practice; it was not the ultimate result. Although they only saw the investigation, they considered that they had received the training, and therefore, after returning to their locality, they did exactly as they had seen, and they trained others to do the same. However, since that was not the final result of our research, they did not receive the real training. At the beginning of this time, I told people that we were still in the stage of investigation, a stage that was experimental in nature, and that we did not yet have the assurance about what we were doing.<p>However, after four and a half years of study, I now have the full confidence and the boldness to tell people that we have completed our study of the four steps of the new way. Every step is according to the Bible and has been determined by studying church history, comparing what others have done, and reviewing the practice among us for the last sixty years. Hence, I have great courage and boldness to definitely say that what has been presented in the previous four messages is absolutely according to the Scriptures; nothing is according to human opinion or ideas. We truly feel good and are happy about these things.<h2 class=head1>BEGETTING, NOURISHING, TEACHING, AND BUILDING BEING OUR LIVING</h2><p>What shall we do now? To do anything does not depend first on the method of doing it but on what kind of person is doing it. The person is far more important than the method. Two people may be taught to do the same thing, and both may learn it. However, one person may be diligent, serious, thorough, and absolute, but the other one may be just the opposite-lazy, loose, sloppy, and careless. Even if they do the same thing in the same way, the results will be extremely different.<p>The church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today is very noble because here we are doing the work of the priests of the gospel. Apparently, every step is a work, but in reality, it is our living, which is the living of the priests of the gospel. In actuality, it is not that we are working but that we are living the Christian life. Our life consists not only of sleeping, eating, being clothed, exercising, studying, and working; there are other matters that comprise our life. First, we need to rise every morning to have a morning revival. Just as we need to wash our face in the morning, so we need to contact the Lord, and just as we need to eat breakfast, so we need to enjoy the Lord. Eating breakfast and enjoying the Lord in the morning are both equally a part of our living. Not only so, we go to work by day; that is also a part of our living. But at night we also must set aside a time to visit our relatives or friends to lead them to salvation. This is a very important part of our living. Then, we must regularly go to the homes of the new ones and meet with them to nourish them with the milk of the word in the Bible and cherish them so that visit after visit they may grow in life. This is also a part of our Christian life. Furthermore, we need to bring them to the small group meetings that they may have a taste of the mutual fellowship of the saints and at the same time learn the truth of the Lord. Thus, they have some amount of learning in truth and some experiences in life, and they also know how to come near to the Lord, fellowship with the Lord, and receive inspiration from Him so that they can stand up to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, in the meetings. This is not a simple matter. Therefore, in our living we must continue to pick up the burden to teach them, perfect them, and demonstrate to them how to prophesy, to speak for the Lord. We must tell them that to prophesy is not to talk about secular matters or merely about how our sicknesses have been healed. Rather, it is to release the truth according to the Bible and testify the truth according to the experience of life. Furthermore, when they speak, they should speak according to inspiration organically, not mechanically. To have the truths of the Bible, the matching experiences of life, and the inspiration is to be organic. This is the proper prophesying, the genuine speaking for the Lord. Every week we need to set aside a little time to help others to exercise in this way. This is also a part of our living.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH LIFE BEING OUR NOBLE &#8220;RECREATION&#8221;</h2><p>Strictly speaking, we do not need everyone to serve the Lord with their full time. According to the natural law in God&#8217;s creation, we cannot work continuously for twenty-four hours a day. Throughout the course of development in history, human beings have come to the conclusion that the most suitable way for our human life is to have eight hours for work, eight hours for sleep, and eight hours for eating, resting, taking a walk, exercising, or engaging in other activities, which consist mostly of recreation and amusements. Without recreation or amusements it is difficult for human beings to feel pleasant, but most recreation and amusements lead people to commit sins and do evil. As Christians and as those who love the Lord, we also need to have a part of our time in our living for recreation and amusement. Our recreation, our amusement, is our church life. What a joy it is to come to the meetings to have mutual fellowship with the brothers and sisters, singing, praying, and testifying! When there is no meeting, we can go to preach the gospel to lead people to salvation, or we can visit the new ones to nourish them in their homes, bring them to the small group meetings to perfect them, and bring them to the Lord&#8217;s Day meeting, teaching them how to prophesy in the meeting. This is our most noble &#8220;amusement.&#8221;<p>I believe that according to God&#8217;s arrangement, every brother and sister can afford at least two nights every week either to visit people for gospel preaching, to nourish the new believers, to bring them to the small group meetings, or to help them to learn to prophesy. If we can do this every week, we will have a normal Christian life. If we live in this way, we can bring at least two people to the Lord every year and equip them to be perfected. It is best to not be overly zealous; otherwise, our work cannot be thorough. If we preach the gospel and bring two or three to salvation, we can nourish and lead them week after week. If we lose one of them, we should go to bring another one or two more to be saved and then nourish and lead them. In this way, from the beginning to the end of the year, we will always have two or three under our nourishing and perfecting. We should calmly consider these matters. What I have fellowshipped can be carried out both by those who have an occupation and by those who have a family. Furthermore, this can be done in an unhurried manner, since it does not require us to go out to do this every day, but only two nights in a week. We must do this regularly, ordinarily, and according to a specified time; we should neither be overly zealous nor indifferent. This is to live the normal Christian life, which is the church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today.<h2 class=head1>REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR LIVING THE CHURCH LIFE IN THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY TODAY</h2><p>For us to live the church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today, there are certain requirements. The first requirement is to be revived every morning. We need to have a revival every morning like the rising of the sun. In this way, our path is the path of the righteous, which shines brighter and brighter (Prov. 4:18). The second requirement is to overcome day by day. Every day we begin with morning revival; then during the day we continue to live an overcoming life and are thereby renewed day by day (2 Cor. 4:16). The third requirement is to live in the Spirit moment by moment (Gal. 5:25). The fourth requirement is to walk according to the Spirit in everything, to not walk according to the flesh (Rom. 8:4), to have no murmurings and reasonings (Phil. 2:14), and to have no selfish intentions and covetousness (Gal. 5:26).<p>The fifth requirement for us to live the church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today is to be in one accord and in harmony with the saints (1 Cor. 1:10), and the sixth requirement is to not be blown by winds of teaching (Eph. 4:14). Among us, the Lord&#8217;s recovery has spread to all the six continents, and there are over one thousand churches with people of different races and kinds. It is unavoidable to have different speakings and teachings. Ever since we began to speak concerning the new way in preaching the gospel by knocking on doors to visit people, some who have dissenting opinions have considered that this is not necessarily the best way to preach the gospel. Although they may be right, we must care for the true situation. If the way of our gospel preaching cannot stir up the spirits of the saints to be priests of the gospel, activate their organic faculties for gospel preaching, or create the opportunity for every brother and sister to preach the gospel directly to others, that is not the way that God desires. Therefore, if we probe deeply into this matter, we will see that only by personally visiting people to preach the gospel can the saints exercise their function of gospel preaching. Generally speaking, this is something that cannot be accomplished by other ways of gospel preaching. For everyone to go out to visit people personally and preach the gospel directly to them is to practice the scriptural way and the most proper, normal way. We cannot say that all other speakings are wrong, but it is easy for them to become winds of teaching that toss people about so that they do not know what to follow. As a result, the saints cannot be in one accord and in harmony with one another, and the church suffers loss.<p>The seventh requirement for living the church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today is to not preach anything different from the teaching concerning God&#8217;s New Testament priesthood of the gospel (1 Tim. 1:3-4). We should not be blown about by the winds of teaching; furthermore, we should not preach or teach different opinions in the church. We have no dissension; we simply work according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy and avoid speaking about anything else.<p>The eighth requirement is to pray watchfully, labor diligently, and struggle earnestly to carry out every step of the duties of God&#8217;s New Testament priests of the gospel (Matt. 26:41; Rom. 12:11; Col. 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:58). For the church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today, we must watch and pray. It is only by this that we can be moved by the Holy Spirit and manifest our organic functions. Furthermore, we need to labor diligently, being serious and thorough, not being slack or slothful, but struggling earnestly according to the power which Christ operates in us.<p>The ninth requirement is to await the Lord&#8217;s coming by living and working in the light of His judgment seat (Phil. 3:20; 2 Cor. 5:10). In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we need to be those awaiting the Lord&#8217;s coming. We are the heavenly citizens, not people belonging to this earth. Our commonwealth exists in the heavens, from where the Lord will come to receive us. We are waiting for His coming, and when He comes, we will receive either His reward or His punishment before His judgment seat. Therefore, today we should live and work in the light of His judgment seat, awaiting His coming. These are the requirements for us to live the church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today. May the Lord bless every one of us. Blessed are we if we receive this word and do accordingly.</body></html>
