   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Yi-Lin, Northern Kiangsu</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings to Sister X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received your letter from Chungking and reckoned that it had taken more than a month and a half to get to me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is really terrible that the communication is so poor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My company has temporarily stopped doing business because of the war.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My health has been bad for more than a month.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You can imagine the condition the church is in under such circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Please do not forget to pray for us!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I received the letter you sent through Ming-hwei.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I sent a letter in reply, but I am concerned about whether it will get to you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It has not arrived Editor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I hope to receive some instructions with regard to my present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Greet Sister Wang, Sister Chang, and all the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May you be blessed with health in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Wu Wei</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Address omitted</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Soo-Jia-Tsui, Northern Kiangsu</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the churches in northern Kiangsu are still under the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are several more churches than there were two years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the Lord's special grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Ji is still in Soo-Jia-Tsui.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have been away from home for the most part since the fall of last year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He constantly leads me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not beneficial for a worker or for a church to have the worker stay in one place for a long time because 1 the Lord's gifts are kept from spreading to other places, 2 it becomes difficult for gifted local ones to rise up to serve the local church, and 3 it becomes a sect subconsciously, with certain churches belonging to certain individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The article on the principle of the work in the second issue of The Open Door is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have not decided where I will go next.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I did not receive the second issue of The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have already received the fourth issue.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Chiu Ri-jien</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>March 30</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Shao-Shing, Chekiang Province One</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Last October, I fled from Hangchow to Chou-Jia-Pu in Shi-Siang.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I stayed there for more than a month.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My wife gave birth to a child one night.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I desperately needed help, a woman suddenly came from the mountain and helped me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This really was God's provision for me; glory be to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After nineteen days I took my family into the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Unfortunately, it rained the whole time, the roads were winding and muddy, and my child kept slipping and falling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thank God for His protection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We finally arrived at a place in the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We stayed in a gospel chapel for three Lord's Days.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then my family and I walked to Yi-Chiao.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was about thirty miles over mountain roads.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was on the road back to Shao-Shing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was not easy to travel with a little baby.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was especially difficult because the boats had all stopped running.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I could only pray silently for God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He indeed made marvelous provisions!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I met someone from my home town.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was actually one of my neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was just hiring a boat to go back home.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we had arrived two hours later, he would have been gone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We were able to ride in the boat with him straight home.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At this point my heart overflowed with praise: "Eye has not seen and ear has not heard...things which God has prepared for those who love Him."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Where is Brother Luan?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Please greet Miss Miao and Miss Tso.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Please send me The Open Door beginning with the first issue so I can read them all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>May you be blessed with the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hsu Tseng-rong</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>March 28</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Address omitted</S>
