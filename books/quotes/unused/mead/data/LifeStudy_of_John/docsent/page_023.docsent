   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Jesus Coming in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Weak and Fragile People</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in the Enjoyment of Their Human Life</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we need to see that Jesus came in resurrection to weak and fragile people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some may ask, How could Jesus come in resurrection when He had not been crucified yet?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To say this is to allegorize.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yes, the whole story of changing water into wine is an allegory, and we need to allegorize every part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Third Day, Signifying in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The day upon which this sign was accomplished was the third day 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The third day signifies the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 1 the words the next day are used three times, in verses 29, 35, and 43.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why does it say the next day three times in chapter one and then speak of the third day in 2:1?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The third day in chapter two should not actually be called the third day, but the fifth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps you should go to John and argue with him, saying, Brother John, you did something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have three next days and so the day mentioned in 2:1 should be the fifth day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John would reply, Dear brother, that was why I did not speak of the second day, third day, and fourth day in chapter one, but called each of them the next day until I called the day in chapter two the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>None of the events which transpired on the next days in chapter one were in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us look at the three next days in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The next day John saw Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! v. 29 . Was that in resurrection? Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How can you say that was in resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Again the next day John and two of his disciples were standing, and looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God! vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>35-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although this happened on the second next day, it did not occur on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The third next day is found in verse 43.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The next day He would go forth into Galilee, and He found Philip; and Jesus said to him, Follow Me. This did not happen on the third day, because the third day is the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>None of the events mentioned in chapter one transpired on the third day, that is, in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only as we come to the changing of water into wine in chapter two do we find mention of the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Cana, a Land of Reeds,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Signifying the Place of Weak and Fragile People</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How do we know that in John 2 Jesus came to weak and fragile people?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We know it by the fact that He went to Cana and that Cana in Hebrew means a land of reeds.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A reed in Scripture signifies fragile people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both Isaiah and Matthew say that we, the weak people, are the bruised reed which the Lord will not break Isa 42:3; Matt 12:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Matthew 11:7, the Lord, when referring to John the Baptist, asked the Jews if they went out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken by the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, John the Baptist was not such a weak, fragile person that could be shaken by the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, Cana as a land of reeds symbolizes the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The whole world is a Cana, full of weak and fragile people to whom the Lord came.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord s coming to Cana signifies His coming into a world full of weak and fragile people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although the people of this earth, like reeds, are weak and fragile, yet the Lord came to them in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Galilee, a Despised Place</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The wedding which Jesus attended in John 2 was in Cana of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Galilee was a place despised by people 7:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a despised place, Galilee signifies the low and mean condition of the world.</S>
