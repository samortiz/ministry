The Son does the will of the Father. In John 5:30 the Lord says, &#8220;I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.&#8221; Then in John 6:38 the Lord testified that He came down from heaven to do the will of Him who sent Him.<h2 class=head2>Speaking the Father&#8217;s Word</h2><p>The Son speaks the Father&#8217;s word. Whatever is spoken by the Son is the word of the Father, because the Son does not speak His own word, but speaks the Father&#8217;s word. In John 14:24 the Lord says concerning this, &#8220;He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father&#8217;s who sent Me.&#8221; In John 7:16 the Lord said regarding His teaching, &#8220;My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.&#8221; The Son speaks the Father&#8217;s word because the Son does not speak from Himself: &#8220;For I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who sent Me has Himself given Me commandment what I should say and what I should speak. And I know that His commandment is eternal life. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak&#8221; (12:49-50).<h2 class=head2>Seeking the Father&#8217;s Glory</h2><p>The Son seeks the Father&#8217;s glory. John 7:18 says, &#8220;He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.&#8221; This verse proves that the Son does not seek His own glory, but seeks the glory of the Father. The Son&#8217;s will is the Father&#8217;s will, the Son&#8217;s work is the Father&#8217;s work, the Son&#8217;s word is the Father&#8217;s word, and the Son&#8217;s glory is the Father&#8217;s glory. The Son has nothing of Himself. All that the Son has is from the Father. The Son and the Father truly are one.<h2 class=head2>Expressing the Father</h2><p>The Son does not express Himself; instead, He expresses the Father. The Son&#8217;s expression is the Father&#8217;s expression. Hence, when we see the Son, we see the Father. This is proved by the exchange between the Lord Jesus and Philip. In John 14:7 the Lord pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known His Father also. Then He said, &#8220;Henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.&#8221; However, Philip replied, &#8220;Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us&#8221; (v. 8). To this, the Lord Jesus answered, &#8220;He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father?&#8221; (v. 9). In the Son the Father is expressed and seen, for the Son is the expression of the Father.<h2 class=head2>Sending the Spirit from with the Father</h2><p>The Gospel of John reveals that the Son sends the Spirit from with the Father. In John 15:26 the Lord speaks of the Comforter, whom He &#8220;will send to you from with the Father&#8221; (lit). Then in 16:7 He goes on to say, &#8220;For if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.&#8221; These verses indicate that the Son sent the Spirit from with the Father. Actually, this means that the Son sent Himself, because the Son is in the Father, and the Spirit comes from with the Father. Eventually, the One who is sent by the Son from the Father is actually the Son Himself.<h2 class=head2>Giving the Spirit to Us</h2><p>The Son also gives the Spirit to us. According to John 3:34b, &#8220;He gives the Spirit not by measure.&#8221; The Spirit is from with the Father, and the Son is in the Father. Whatever the Son gives is the Son Himself. Therefore, the Spirit given by the Son is actually the Son Himself.<h2 class=head2>Becoming the Spirit through Death and Resurrection</h2><p>The Son became the Spirit through death and resurrection. According to 1 Corinthians 15:45b, Christ, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit. On the day of His resurrection, Christ breathed on His disciples and said to them, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (John 20:22). We may say that Christ already was the Spirit when He was in the flesh. The difference here is that His flesh was a covering comparable to a shell. Through death and resurrection, the opaque shell of the flesh became transparent. Therefore, now we can see that the Lord is the Spirit. Through death and resurrection, the last Adam in the opaque shell of the flesh became the life-giving Spirit. This is still the same Jesus, but now the shell is transparent. Hence, the One who was with the disciples is the same One who is now the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head2>Abiding in Us as the Spirit with the Father</h2><p>After becoming the Spirit, the Lord abides in us as the Spirit with the Father (John 14:16-20; 17:23, 26). Do you know who abides in you? The Son abides in you as the Spirit with the Father. The Son sends the Spirit, and then the Son comes with the Spirit. Thus, when the Spirit comes, the Son comes. Furthermore, when the Son comes, the Father also comes. This means that when the Spirit comes, all Three of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit- come. Therefore, now the Son abides in us as the Spirit with the Father. This is for the dispensing of the Triune God into our being.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_157.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_159.html">Next</a> </body></html>
