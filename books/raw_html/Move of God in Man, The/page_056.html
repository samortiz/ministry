<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. The Advocate&#151;the Paraclete, the Comforter, the Patron, the One Who Is at Our Side<br>to Help Us, to Take Care of Us and Our Case,<br>to Intercede for Us, to Give Us Counsel,<br>and to Console Us</H2><P>In His ascension Christ is our Advocate (1 John 2:1). As the Advocate He is the Paraclete, the Comforter, the Patron, the One who is at our side to help us, to take care of us and our case, to intercede for us, to give us counsel, and to console us. He takes care of everything concerning us. The Greek word for advocate can also refer to one who offers legal aid like an attorney. Christ, of course, takes care of our case in every aspect. Today we have both the Lord Jesus in the heavens and the Spirit, the Comforter (John 14:16), within us as our Advocate, who takes care of our case.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. The Great Shepherd&#151;the Chief Shepherd,<br>to Take Care of God's Flock and<br>Be the Overseer of Our Souls</H2><P>Christ is the great Shepherd, the Chief Shepherd, to take care of God's flock and be the Overseer of our souls (Heb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 5:4; 2:25). A shepherd of actual sheep cannot do anything to help the sheep in their souls. But today Christ shepherds us by overseeing our souls. Our soul is the part of our being which needs the most shepherding. Our body is troublesome, but the most troublesome part of our person is our soul. To deal with others in a proper way, we have to take care of their souls. If a husband cannot take care of his wife's soul, he is a defeated husband. Our soul is our inner being, our real person. Our Lord as the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls, shepherds us by caring for the welfare of our inner being and by exercising His oversight over the condition of our real person.</P><P>Christ's shepherding of us is a part of God's history. As the Advocate He prays for us and that is God's praying, so that is God's move in us as a part of God's history. The move of God in Christ within us in His ascension is a part of God's history in His union with man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. The Head over All Things to the Church</H2><P>In addition to all the above items, Christ is also the Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:20-22). Today it seems that in the universe there is no head. But, actually, Christ, the ascended Savior as the Lord of all in the universe, is the Head over all things to the church. His being the Head over all things is related to the church. So He could also be the Head of the church. Hence, He is quite qualified, quite capable, to take care of the church in every way to meet the church's need in different situations. This is also a part of God's move in Christ's ascension.</P>
