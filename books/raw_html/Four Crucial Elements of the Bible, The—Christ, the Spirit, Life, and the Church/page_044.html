<h2 class=head2>Romans 8:16</h2><p>The fourth passage that speaks of the human spirit with the Spirit is Romans 8:16, which says, “The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.” John 1:12 says that as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name. Being a child of God is not something which we imagine with our mind or feel with our emotions. How do we experience being children of God? It is by the Spirit’s witnessing with our spirit. The Spirit as the Spirit of the consummated Triune God comes to witness with our spirit. In other words, since the Spirit of the Triune God is in our spirit, He can witness with our spirit that we are children born of God. This verse strongly indicates that the Spirit of the Triune God is in our spirit.<h2 class=head2>2 Timothy 4:22</h2><p>Paul says in 2 Timothy 4:22, “The Lord be with your spirit.” As we have seen, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, “The Lord is the Spirit.” The Lord is the Spirit; therefore, He can be with our spirit and is even in our spirit.<p>Putting these five verses from the Scriptures together, we can see a clear picture that the Triune God as the Spirit today is in our spirit. When we worship God, we must worship Him in spirit; when we testify, we testify in our spirit; and when we enjoy the Lord, we enjoy Him in our spirit.<h2 class=head1>SERVICE TO GOD NEEDING TO BE IN SPIRIT</h2><p>Since God as the Spirit is in our spirit, we must serve Him in spirit. The apostle Paul says in Romans 1:9, “God...whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son.” This indicates that we must serve God in spirit. Our service to God should not be in letter, rituals, or teaching but in our spirit. Whatever we are and have must be in spirit. Therefore, 7:6 says that we serve God in newness of spirit, and 12:11 says that we must be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.<h2 class=head1>THE HUMAN SPIRIT IN EPHESIANS</h2><h2 class=head2>The Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation</h2><p>Ephesians has six chapters, and in every chapter our spirit is mentioned. In 1:17 the apostle asks God to give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation. In Greek, spirit here refers not to the Holy Spirit but to our regenerated human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. Our spirit within our being is a spirit of revelation, a heavenly “window” that is capable of receiving light from heaven. God’s revelation and light enter into our entire being through our spirit. Therefore, before he spoke concerning the profound truths in Ephesians, Paul first prayed that God would make our spirit a spirit of revelation.<h2 class=head2>The Reality and Building Up of the Church Being Only in Our Spirit</h2><p>Ephesians 2:22 says that the church is built up into a dwelling place of God in spirit. Apparently, the church being God’s house means that God has a house among the saints. Actually, the church as God’s house is in the believers’ spirit. If the believers in a local church do not know their spirit nor serve and live in spirit, but rather live and walk according to their mind, opinions, and emotions, how can there be the house of God? Such a church is only a church in name; it does not have the reality of the church. The reality of the church is in our spirit. If every one of us walks in spirit and worships God in spirit, the church has the reality and is the dwelling place of God.<p>For us to be built up together in the church, we must be in our spirit. When we are in our mind, we have only opinions and divisions. When we are in our emotion, we have only contentions and murmurings. Very often those whom we love the most are also the ones with whom we are angry the most. If we do not have any dealings with others, there are no arguments, but once we make friends with others, we begin to have quarrels. The same is true even between husbands and wives. The building up of the church is a spiritual matter. When we exercise our emotions, the church is gone. When we exercise our emotions, we open the door to the flesh, opinions, and quarreling; thus, the building work is finished. We may not quarrel outwardly, but if we still exercise our emotions inwardly, there cannot be the building up because we are still outside the spirit. The building up of the church is a matter in spirit.<p>Hence, whether we are young or old, we must be in spirit. Only in the spirit can we have the building and the church. Everything depends on the spirit, not on whether it is good or bad, or right or wrong. It is not that if we are gentle, then there is the church, and that if we are hot-tempered, then there is no church. Rather, only when we are in spirit can there be the church. Therefore, if we are not in spirit, we should not speak, exercise our emotion, or become angry. We should be in spirit not only when we praise or sing hymns but also when we are angry. It is not enough to be in spirit when we pray. If we are in spirit even when we are angry, the church will surely be built up. When we are in spirit, even if we become angry, we are angry for the Lord and not for ourselves. Therefore, when we are angry, we must first return to our spirit, and if it is not of the Lord, we should not become angry. In this way we can be built up together in spirit.
