   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BIBLE CAUSES US TO BELIEVE IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am one who preaches the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Among us, many co-workers also preach the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we are all those who believe in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all believe that His death has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He did not die for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, He died to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But let me ask you a question.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Can you find one place in the entire Bible that says that we should believe that the Lord Jesus has died for us?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Where in the entire New Testament does it say that we should believe in the Lord's death for us?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no such place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is most peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is not a single verse in the entire New Testament that tells us that we should believe in the Lord's death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not misunderstand and think that I despise the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am very much for the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But one must pay attention to the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is not a single place in the New Testament that says that we should believe in the Lord Jesus' dying for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are countless places in the Bible that tell us that Jesus died for us and for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But there is not one place that tells us to take His death as the object of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Gospel of John tells us that we have to believe 3:15-16, 18, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But it does not speak about believing in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It only speaks of believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is another thing that is equally peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Testament tells us to believe that God has raised Jesus from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible does not say that the cross or the death of the Lord Jesus is the object of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, it says that resurrection is the object of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe we all know the verse in Romans 10:9, "That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why does the Bible not ask us to believe in the cross of the Lord, but asks us to believe in His resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why does the Bible never ask us to believe in the cross of the Lord Jesus, but ask us to believe that God has raised Him from the dead?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers, we must consider this a little.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If it were up to our reading of the Bible, we would think that the cross is the most important thing, and that there should be at least one word that says that we should believe in the Lord's death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But there is not a single word about this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why is this the case?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One brother may answer that if Christ has not resurrected, our faith is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is true that twice in 1 Corinthians 15 it says that if Christ has not been raised, then our faith is vain vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>14, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But this word does not help us to solve the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the contrary, it makes our problem all the more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If there is no resurrection, our faith is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, resurrection is something that we should believe in. We know that redemption is a matter between God and the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not God's demand on man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Redemption is not something that the Lord has done to satisfy man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is the Lord Jesus' satisfaction of God's demand of holiness, righteousness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord's death and the redemptive work that He accomplished are transactions that went on between God and the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not something that is sounded out as the object of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The basis of our faith is God's raising of Jesus from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, today our faith is not in the blood of the Lord Jesus' redeeming us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can never fully understand this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even a man as spiritual as Andrew Murray, who knew God so well, said that he did not know how much value there is to the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even he said that when he went before God, he could only pray, "God, I do not know how much worth is the blood of Your Son before You.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But I ask that all the worth of Your Son's blood be realized in me."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord's blood is of such worth that if I would only say so much, I will not be able to receive all that He has done, and His work would be limited by my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not know the worth of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But we do know the worth of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The blood of the Lord satisfied God's demand, and we do not know how great that demand is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But we do know how great the satisfaction is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I do not know how much I owed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Perhaps it was ten talents or perhaps ten million talents.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But I know that the death of the Lord is sufficient to save me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How do I know this?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is because He has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am not trusting in the money I put into the bank to be enough or not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is not what I am trusting in. I do not even have to trust that all the money that I have put in was genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What I am trusting in is that God would not give me a counterfeit receipt.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even if the redemption of the Lord were wrong, whatever mistakes there could be, God would never issue a wrong receipt.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, though I do not know how much the blood has met God's demand, I do know that it has satisfied God's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the Lord had not satisfied God, God would not have resurrected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, you can believe in a most ignorant way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You do not have to ask whether the blood of the Lord is sufficient, or whether the Lord's work of redemption is approved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You only have to ask if God has resurrected the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Since the Lord Jesus has resurrected, all you have to do is believe.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We believe in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is why the Bible only requires us to believe in resurrection; it does not require us to believe in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The work of the cross is only conveyed to us to let us know what the Lord has done before God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What we preach and believe is the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It includes His death and His life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Once I see the receipt, immediately I know that the amount is adequate and that every bank note is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Tonight I can sleep well because the Lord Jesus has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If the Lord had not resurrected, even though He has died and redeemed us, we still could not sleep in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How do I know that His blood is sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How do I know that the problem of sin is solved?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Because we are justified, He has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Hence, we believe in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I do not know how many are sitting here who are still worried about their salvation, who are still doubting and are not sure.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When you ask yourself whether you have trusted in Jesus, you may say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When you ask yourself whether you believe that Jesus has died for you, you may also say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But in you there is still a question.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You may think that to believe in Jesus is not sufficient to be forgiven of your sins, that you may still have to do some good works.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You may still think this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But you only need to know one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Why did God resurrect the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Why did God issue a receipt?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The fact that God is willing to issue you the receipt proves that the amount that you have put in was right.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When God raised His Son from the dead, it proved that the redemption that His Son accomplished was a righteous one.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God cannot do anything unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Resurrection proves that the work of the Lord Jesus is effective before God.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is why the New Testament emphasizes so much our believing that God has raised His Son from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The two verses that we mentioned earlier in 1 Corinthians 15 are very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Verse 14 says, "And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is vain; your faith is vain also."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Verse 17 then says, "And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If Christ has not resurrected, one will not know what has become of the things that he has believed in. Another wonderful thing is seen in 1 Corinthians 15:3 which says, "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures." But in verse 17 it says, "If Christ has not been raised...you are still in your sins." Do not these two verses contradict each other? Verse 3 says that He has died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>That means He has solved the problem of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Why does verse 17 say that if Christ has not been raised, we are still in our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This verse is quite peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Perhaps you would have changed that to, "If Christ has not died for you, you are still in your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we changed the words been raised to died, we would readily be able to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Since Christ has died for us, we are no longer in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>But verse 3 says that Christ has died for our sins already.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Now verse 17 says that without Christ's resurrection, we are still in our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>My friends, the matter is actually very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>On the one hand, Christ has died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But when do we know that we are no longer in sin, and when do we know that we have been freed from sin?</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>It is when the Lord Jesus was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>It is when the Lord was resurrected that we realized that we were redeemed from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We have to distinguish between these two.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The redemption and deliverance from sin before God is due to the Lord's death; it is not due to His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>But for us, it is the Lord's resurrection, rather than His death, that we realize.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>For my creditor, the time a debt is settled is when he sees the money.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>But for me, it is settled when I see the receipt.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>My creditor only looks at the money, and I only look at the receipt.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>God's eyes only see the death of the Lord Jesus, and our eyes only see His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>God does not need the resurrection of the Lord as His proof.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>He knows very well that the Lord's death is adequate for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>The problem is that we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>A receipt is not written for the one who receives money.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>It is written for one who pays the money.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>No receipt is prepared for the creditor.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>All receipts are made out for the debtors.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>They are written to give the debtors peace of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Hence, before God the Lord's death is sufficient for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>As long as He dies, God is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Resurrection tells us that He is satisfied, that the death of the Lord has redeemed us from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>But if the Lord has not resurrected, even though we have been redeemed from our sins, we still would not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>With the death of the Lord, the problem of sin is forever dealt with before God.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Without resurrection, we would not have the confidence that our sins are indeed dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>The fact of forgiveness lies in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>The assurance of forgiveness lies in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>The Lord's death redeems us from sins, and the Lord's resurrection allows us to know that we have been redeemed from our sins.</S>
