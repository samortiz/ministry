   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PSALMIST'S PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 8, 9, 11, and 12 are the psalmist's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Praying That God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Will Behold Their Shield</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>and Look upon the Face of His Anointed</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Behold our shield, O God;/And look upon the face of Your anointed" v. 9 . The "shield" in this verse refers to David the king, and the "anointed" refers also to David the king, typifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here the psalmist prayed concerning David, saying that he was the shield to protect them and that he was God's anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In typology, however, this anointed one, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In our prayer we may say, "O God, look upon the face of Christ, Your anointed One, who is our Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. To Enjoy Jehovah Our God in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>as a Sun, a Shield, Grace, and Glory,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lacking Nothing</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 11a says, "Jehovah God is a sun and a shield."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sun is the source of light, and light gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Plants, animals, and human beings all need sunlight in order to live and grow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our spiritual life, we also need sunlight, and for this we have Christ as our source of light and life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 11b-c the psalmist goes on to say that Jehovah gives grace and glory with nothing good withheld.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Grace and glory are both God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Grace is God for our enjoyment, and glory is God for our splendor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, in these verses Jehovah God in Christ is four things to us: the shield, the sun, the grace, and the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Psalm 84 was written according to the psalmist's background, which was very similar to Job's background.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 11c the psalmist says that God "does not withhold anything good/From those who walk uprightly."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 12 he goes on to declare, "O Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man/Who trusts in You."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 11d "those who walk uprightly" probably refers, in the complex sentiments of the psalmist, to those who keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 12 "the man who trusts in You" probably refers, also in the complex sentiments of the psalmist, to the man who dwells in God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What we have here is the complex expression of the mixed sentiments of the psalmist.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such sentiments were not according to God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Job walked uprightly, yet God not only withheld something from him but also stripped him and consumed him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, Job trusted in God, yet he did not always have God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you believe that it is because we walk uprightly that we today enjoy Christ as our sun, shield, grace, and glory?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you believe that it is because we trust in God that He blesses us?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must confess that in ourselves we cannot walk uprightly or have a firm trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Does this mean that we lose Christ as our sun, shield, grace, and glory?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No, this is not our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In type, Psalm 84 shows us how excellent the church life is and how we should treasure it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we enjoy the cross of Christ, and here we enjoy Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all should take the highway to come to the church and then dwell here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we enjoy our David, our anointed One, our Christ, who is our sun, our shield, our grace, and our glory.</S>
