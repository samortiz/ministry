   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>GOD CALLING THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO CARRY OUT HIS MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is so good to be young persons in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In every age and generation God has come to the young people for the carrying out of His move.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both the Bible and church history show us that God wants to use the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may say that Adam was very young when God was with him because he had just been created.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Abel, the second generation of man in the line of life, was probably also young when he offered sacrifices to the Lord Gen 4:2, 4 .</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was sixty-five years old when he began to walk with God, but at his time a man who was sixty-five years old was still young.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He walked with God for three hundred years, and God took him at the age of three hundred sixty-five Gen 5:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Abraham also was called when he was a young man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may point out that Abraham was seventy-five years old when he was called by God Gen 12:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if you read the Scriptures carefully, you will see that Abraham was seventy-five years old when his father Terah died in Haran Gen 11:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Acts 7:2 tells us that "the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first time God called Abraham was while his father was still alive, and the second call came after his father had died.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the first time God came to Abraham was much earlier than when he was seventy-five years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, we have to realize that at Abraham's time, a man who was seventy-five years old was still quite young.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moses was called by God and began to serve Him when he was eighty years old, but his preparation for service began when he was a small boy being nursed by his mother.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>David also was a young man when he was anointed to be king 1 Sam 16:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, Daniel was young when he was an overcomer in the palace of the king of Babylon Dan 1:4, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament, none of the apostles whom Jesus called was an old man.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Lord walked along the shore of the sea of Galilee, He called the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Zebedee was with his two sons, John and James, but the Lord called only the sons and not Zebedee Matt 4:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was God's divine way and economy to call the sons and not the father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The elders in the first church on the earth, the church in Jerusalem, were young people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible also tells us that Timothy became an apostle 1 Thes 1:1; cf.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 2 Timothy 2:22 Paul wrote, "Flee youthful lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that the receiver of that Epistle was still a young man.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All those who were in the initial stage of the Lord's recovery of the proper church life over fifty years ago were young people in their twenties.</S>
