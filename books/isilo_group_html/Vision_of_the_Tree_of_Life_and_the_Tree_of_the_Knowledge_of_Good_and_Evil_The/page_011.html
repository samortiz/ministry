BETWEEN GOOD AND LIFE</h2>
<p>Even after two thousand years of history, Christianity is still not free from its involvement with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Although there are wicked men in the world who commit evil deeds and frequently provoke God&rsquo;s judgment, just as the men who developed on the evil side of the tree of knowledge in the Old Testament books of history did, there are a few people chosen by God who are like Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. These ones learn to follow God, contact God, walk with God, and call upon God. They are not on the evil side of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but are on the line of the tree of life. Regrettably, Christianity also has many who are on the side of good, like the men in the books of poetry. A considerable number of believers are developing on the good side of the tree of knowledge. No matter how these people develop, they always encounter God&rsquo;s tearing down. This tearing down is not because they are bad but because they are good. God continues to judge the evil side, and He continues to tear down the good side. The evil side is large and includes all evil men. The good side is narrow and includes only those who fear God and who want to do something for God in order to please Him.</p>
<p>A considerable number of Christians are still in the good of the tree of knowledge, just like the God-fearing men in the books of poetry. A few Christians have been enlightened or torn down to come out of the side of good and are learning to contact God as life. Hence, there are two types of messages, two types of sermons, among Christians. One type of message teaches man how to fear God, how to do something to please God, and how to turn away from evil. This type of message enlightens man in relation to the good side of the tree of knowledge. The other type of message is on the line of the tree of life and leads people to know life. We must ask ourselves whether we are developing and being established according to the good of the tree of knowledge or learning to enjoy the tree of life. Do the messages we give just enlighten believers concerning the good side of the tree of knowledge, or do they bring believers to contact the tree of life? This is a serious matter!</p>
<p>In theory it may seem easy to discern between the two types of messages. However, it is difficult to discern between them because the differences are subtle. For example, we dare not say that it is not good for the saints in a church to zealously offer up their material possessions, but this may not be the tree of life. We dare not say that it is not good for the saints in a locality to keep morning watch and be godly, but this may not be the tree of life. We dare not say that it is not good for a brother to zealously preach the gospel, but this too may not be the tree of life. The distinction is very subtle. Those who serve God should be able to discern between these two trees. No matter how good a thing may be, if it does not touch God, contact God, or lead us to enjoy God or take Him as life, it belongs to the tree of knowledge.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision of the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
