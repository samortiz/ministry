   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAMPSTAND, THE STONE, THE LAMB, AND GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The revelation in the Bible is always progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first mention of the seven lamps is in Exodus, but the development of the seven lamps is in Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the book of Exodus we cannot see that these seven lamps are the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to see this, we must proceed from Exodus to Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Zechariah 4:2 and 10 we see clearly that the seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Zechariah 3:9 shows that the seven eyes of God are the seven eyes of the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The seven lamps are the seven eyes of God, and these seven eyes are also on the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Zechariah, this stone is for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Zerubbabel was in the process of building the temple, and that stone with the seven eyes was for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually we see that the stone with the seven eyes is the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the book of Revelation we see that the seven eyes of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of God, the seven eyes on the stone, and the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the lampstand equals the stone, the stone equals the Lamb, and the Lamb equals God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Exodus we have a lampstand with seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Zechariah we see that these seven lamps are the seven eyes of God and the seven eyes of the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The book of Revelation indicates that these seven eyes are also the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seven lamps are the seven eyes of God, the seven eyes of the stone, and the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This proves that the lampstand is God, that God is the stone, and that the stone is the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The lampstand is the stone, the stone is the Lamb, and the Lamb is God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These four things the lampstand, the stone, the Lamb, and God are four in one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The lampstand is for shining, the stone is for building, the Lamb is for redeeming, and God is for administrating.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we have the shining stand, the building stone, the redeeming Lamb, and the administrating God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE SEVEN SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>FOR ADMINISTRATION AND TRANSFUSION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The seven lamps of the shining lampstand are the seven eyes of the building stone; the seven eyes of the building stone are the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb; and the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb are the seven eyes of the administrating God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These seven lamps and these seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are not only the seven lamps and the seven eyes, but also the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the previous messages we have covered many of the crucial aspects of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this message we have the conclusion of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This conclusion is that in the present age the Spirit is the seven Spirits of God who are the seven lamps of fire burning for God's administration and also the seven eyes of the redeeming and building One for transfusion and infusion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The lamps of burning fire are for God's administration, and the eyes are for the redeeming and building One's transfusion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I realize that this thought is foreign to today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, it is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the past did anyone tell you that the lampstand as God's testimony is for God's administration or that the seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of the administrating God and the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Did anyone tell you that these seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb are the seven eyes of the building stone?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Did anyone tell you that the seven lamps as the seven Spirits are for God's administration and that the seven eyes as the seven Spirits of God are for Christ's transfusion?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You probably never heard any of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The seven lamps are for God's administration to accomplish God's purpose, and the seven eyes are for Christ's infusing to perfect us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, these seven Spirits are seven lamps shining, burning, searching, judging, and carrying out God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, these seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the redeeming and building Christ to infuse whatever Christ is into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever He looks at us, we receive an infusion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is today's life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today the life-giving Spirit is the seven Spirits of God as the seven lamps of fire burning to carry out God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While He is burning us, He is looking at us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is not only the lamps of fire burning for God's administration, but also the eyes of the redeeming Lamb looking at us, not to judge us and expose our faults, but to grant us His precious infusion.</S>
