<h2 class="head4">b. Proper Clothing with Modesty and Sobriety</h2><p>Let us look at 1 Timothy 2:9-11: "Similarly, that women adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing, but, what befits women professing godly reverence, by good works. Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection."</p><p>One of God's basic requirements for the sister is modesty. It is good to feel modest and to be conscious of shame. This is a natural protection for the sisters. Sisters who are conscious of shame and who are modest are protected naturally. Do not wear dresses which are contrary to your sense of shame. You must exercise sobriety. Do not wear immodest clothes. Immodesty is contrary to sobriety. Always wear "proper clothing." Every sister knows what is proper in her particular community. We should always wear clothes which are considered proper by those around us. A Christian should not wear clothes which provide an opportunity for heathens to say, "Do Christians wear such things too?" Our standard must never be lower than that of the heathens'. We must learn to have modesty and sobriety and must know what constitutes "proper clothing."</p><p>Verse 9 continues: "Not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing." This particularly refers to the curling of hair. Peter was referring to the many fashions that women apply to their hair. Curling the hair means making many curls like clusters of vines. Women were already concerned with fashion two thousand years ago. Today many think that it is fashionable to curl their hair into clusters. Actually, this is something very ancient; it was being done two thousand years ago. Costly clothing is spoken of here as well. Some dresses have the same value but are priced differently. We should not wear the costly ones or spend extra money on them.</p><p>Sisters must take care of propriety in their clothing. We have no intention, nor did Paul or Peter, to ask a sister to be careless, loose, or unconcerned about her attire. Neither should we set our mind on fancy dresses and costly clothing. Sisters should wear proper clothing; they should learn to manage their wardrobe properly. They should set their wardrobe in proper order, using ordinary material at reasonable cost. No sister should be unconcerned about the way she attires herself.</p><p>Some sisters spend too much time on their clothing. They pay too much attention to fancy clothes and costly dresses. Other sisters do not care for the tidiness and the cleanliness of their attire; they are very careless about their clothing. This shows that they are sloppy. A woman's dress is a true reflection of her character. If one does not pay attention to personal grooming and cleanliness, such a person is loose, sloppy, and careless. Our clothing must be proper, neat, and clean. It must be simple, but clean.</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Seal of the Holy Spirit upon One's Clothing</h2><p>Leviticus 8:30 says that, according to the command of God, "Moses took some of the anointing oil...and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons and on the garments of his sons with him; and he sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons and the garments of his sons with him." Thus, our clothing must be sealed with the mark of holiness. There should be the seal of the Holy Spirit, the seal of the anointing oil, on our clothing. When one is anointed, his garment is also anointed, and both are sanctified together.</p><p>In Numbers 15:38 God also commanded the Israelites to make tassels on the corners of their garments and put a cord of blue upon the tassel of each corner. Blue is the color of heaven. This serves to remind men of the heavenly things. A believer's clothing must have a heavenly taste to it. It must not express the world. Do not follow the world in its freedom and fancy. We should have the expression of heaven in our clothing. Our clothing, as well as ourselves, should be fully sanctified.</p><h2 class="head3">6. Principles Concerning Clothing</h2><h2 class="head4">a. Personal Freedom</h2><p>I would like to say a general word according to my personal opinion on clothing. I am not saying that every child of God should dress the same way. I have no intention to ask all the sisters to ignore outward beauty altogether. I am not saying that all the brothers and sisters should use the cheapest fabric and the worst materials for their clothing. The Bible has no such commandment. When John came, he was clothed with camel's skin. But when the Lord Jesus came, His undergarment was a seamless garment, the best of the time. There is one basic principle of Christian clothing&mdash;God has given everyone the freedom to wear what he likes. We are free to choose the materials we like and to pick the style we prefer.</p>
