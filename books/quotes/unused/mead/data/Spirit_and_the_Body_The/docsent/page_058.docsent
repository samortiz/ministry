   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOING TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the matter of gaining the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every church must go to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In any field the future is with the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If an industry or a school does not gain young people, that industry or school has no future.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This generation is the generation of the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, this does not mean that we do not appreciate the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are three reasons why we must go to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first reason is that the young people are not occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is best to contact young people between the ages of sixteen and twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During these years they begin to understand things, but they are not occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we must seize the opportunity to gain the high school students and the freshmen in college.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When many young people turn eighteen, they are eager to leave home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the right time to gain them for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second reason for going to the young people is the fact that so many young people are gathered in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No other age is gathered together like this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the young people are gathered in the schools, it is easy to contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to catch fish, you must go where the fish are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The third reason is that it is easy for the young people, especially those at the end of their teen-age years, to have a change in their mind, that is, it is easy for them to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To repent means to have a change of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you present something solid, worthwhile, and interesting to young people, they will take it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For these three reasons, every local church must work on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who engage in this campus work should be young, the younger the better.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is difficult for someone more than twenty-seven years of age to talk to a person seventeen years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is better that we work with those in our own age group.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I went to work on the campuses, no young people would want to talk to me, because I am an old person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if I were a young person, it would be very easy for other young people to talk to me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we should not send the older ones to work on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the older ones, those over twenty-seven, should not think that there is nothing for them to do or that they should retire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>An army has more personnel than just the young soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The entire church is a fighting body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But this does not mean that everyone must go to the frontier to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, we should send the young ones to the frontier and let the others work in the background.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, the older ones can spend much time in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if we asked the young people to stay behind and pray, it would be very difficult for them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It would be like interrupting a basketball game and asking the players to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because their heart and interest are in playing basketball, the players would find this very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even while they are praying, they would be eager to dribble the ball.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead of asking the young people to stop and pray, we should pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need both a playing team and a praying team.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The young people should be the playing team, and the older ones should be the praying team.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we are all one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you ask me to stay home to pray, I will be very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For me to pray at home is enjoyable.</S>
