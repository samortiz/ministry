   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A Heresy in the Creeds the Mother of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the heresy in the creeds the Mother of God Theotokos .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Earlier we said that this heresy was recorded in the Chalcedonian Confession of Faith adopted in A.D. 451.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Greek, Theo means "God," and tokos means "bearer"; hence, Theotokos is rendered "the Mother of God."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a great heresy, for how can the eternal God have a finite human being of flesh as His "Mother"?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps some may argue that the mention of "the Mother of God" is related to Christ's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yes, according to His humanity, He had a mother, but we cannot say that this mother is "the Mother of God."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Theological studies throughout the ages concluded, based upon the Bible, that our Lord Jesus is indeed the complete God who came in the flesh to become a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His divinity is complete and His humanity is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As God, He possesses divinity; as a man, He possesses humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to His humanity, Mary is His mother; but we cannot say that Mary is His mother in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can only say that Mary is the mother of the man Jesus; we cannot say that Mary is the Mother of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus is God, not a partial God, but the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is neither just one part of the Triune God nor just one-third of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is God Rom 9:5 , not only God the Son but the complete God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Isa 9:6; John 14:9; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, the Lord Jesus is also a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just as man has a spirit, He also has a spirit John 11:33 ; just as man has a soul, He also has a soul Matt 26:38 ; just as man has a body, He also has a body John 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since He has humanity, it was necessary that He have a mother for the human birth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, Mary is His mother in His humanity but not His mother in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we cannot call Mary "the Mother of God."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This heresy led to a great dispute in the Roman Catholic Church concerning the matter of whether Mary had "original sin."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This dispute lasted over fourteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then in the 1850s it was officially determined by the Pope that Mary did not have original sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a great heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This point has become a strong factor of our refusal to accept the creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We admit that the major part of the creeds is right, yet they contain such a great heresy in the statement, recorded in plain words, concerning "the Mother of God."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Inadequacy of the Creeds</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Besides the heresy about "the Mother of God," there are no other gross errors in the creeds; in fact, many of the items in the creeds are quite accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, all the creeds, besides containing some errors, are incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, they cannot be our rules of faith but can serve only as references.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For over fifty to sixty years I myself have directly received a great deal from the Bible by finding out the truths, item by item, contained in it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By the spring of 1983, what I found was nearly complete.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then when I spent time to refer to the creeds, I discovered that many items in the creeds are similar to what we have seen, yet I also found out that the creeds are short of many items.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the following paragraphs I will enumerate and briefly discuss fifteen items that are missing in the creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that you will be able to understand and enter into them and even apply and speak them. a. The Last Adam Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First Corinthians 15:45b says that "the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The omission of this point is the greatest defect of the creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible tells us that the Lord Jesus is the Word who was in the beginning and that the Word became flesh; in the flesh He is the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In God's eyes the Lord Jesus is the last man and, as such, He concludes the adamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through His death and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a very great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today after having read through the Bible and having some amount of experience, we have this conclusion: this life-giving Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
