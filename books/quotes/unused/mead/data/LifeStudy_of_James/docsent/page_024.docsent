   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JAMES MESSAGE EIGHT PRACTICAL VIRTUES OF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION 8 Scripture Reading: James 3:1-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to chapter three of the Epistle of James.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 1 through 12 of this chapter are concerned with bridling the tongue, and verses 13 through 18, with behaving in wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>BRIDLING THE TONGUE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is extremely difficult to bridle our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, you may find that you are not able to keep yourself from speaking even for an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if we fail to bridle our tongue, we are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, if we restrict our tongue, we are wise.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wisdom in practical Christian perfection is related to restricting our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In James 3 two words are crucial the tongue and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For years I was not able to understand the last part of this chapter, the verses concerning wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I could not understand them because I did not have the key.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But now I have seen that the key is that restricting our tongue is the way to have wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Foolishness is related to talking too much, and wisdom is related to bridling our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 3:1 James says, Do not become many teachers, my brothers, knowing that we shall receive greater judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Teachers tend to bring in different teachings, and this produces different opinions and causes trouble and division see 2 Tim 4:3; 1 Tim 1:3-4, 7; Eph 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 1 James says that teachers will receive greater judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever we say will be judged, and we shall be judged by our words Matt 12:36-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although we need to learn to bridle our tongue in our daily living, we all should be encouraged to speak in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If this becomes our practice, the meetings will be greatly uplifted, blessing will come, and problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Problems in married life are often due to the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a husband and wife would bridle their tongues, many of their problems would be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But because some have an unruly tongue, this tongue creates serious problems, and these problems may even result in divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to my experience in human life, I can testify that the best way to avoid trouble is to restrict our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regarding the proper use of our tongue, we need to ask God for wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The wisdom James speaks of in chapter three is a continuation of that mentioned in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need wisdom to know how to use our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1:19 James says, Let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Speaking often stirs up wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if we restrict our tongue, we shall also limit our anger.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, suppose you are somewhat unhappy with a certain person, and you point out to him something he has done wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Simply by speaking to him in this way you may strike a match that is able to start a great fire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if you would restrain yourself from speaking to him concerning that matter, his wrath would not be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, in his wisdom James tells us to be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Married brothers need to practice this with their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They should be quick to hear their wives, but slow to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, if your wife complains to you about something, you will be wise if you hear her but are slow to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you speak in haste, you may stir up a fire that can cause serious problems.</S>
