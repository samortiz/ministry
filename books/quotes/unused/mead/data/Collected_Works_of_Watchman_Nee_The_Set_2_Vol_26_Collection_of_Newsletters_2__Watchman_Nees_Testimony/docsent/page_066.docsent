   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN ANNOUNCEMENT FROM WATCHMAN NEE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because I was suffering from heart disease in February of last year, I do not have much strength even when I am feeling somewhat better.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this reason, I have not been able to answer many letters in a timely fashion; some have not been answered at all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I really apologize to you brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I hope that you do not blame me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Please relay this message to others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is not much strength left in me, so I dare not expend it all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, our ministry is prayer and preaching the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although other matters benefit the brothers and sisters, we cannot take care of them all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>July 15, 1935</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>AN ANNOUNCEMENT FROM</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE RESPONSIBLE BROTHERS IN SHANGHAI</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We no longer run the brothers' apartment which we had here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If brothers and sisters from other localities have business in Shanghai and need hospitality from the church in Shanghai, please send a letter beforehand to the responsible brothers here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will do our best to give you hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you try to make arrangements on the spur of the moment, it will be hard to avoid oversights, and we will all be inconvenienced.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We will notify you when our brothers' apartment is resumed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The responsible brothers in Shanghai,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Wu Hsi Ku, Tu Chung Ch'en, Lin Kuang Piao</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>July 15, 1935</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A LETTER TO THE CO-WORKERS CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE CANCELLATION OF COLLECTION OF NEWSLETTERS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Shanghai Overcomer Conference last year we saw what God's center is and how Christ should be the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unfortunately, in the past two years we have not seen more loyalty, faith, or love toward Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, our spiritual edification and growth have not been what they should be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, leaving the denominations, forms of meeting, baptism, and head covering have become the center of our truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Who is responsible for this change?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have heard the terms obedience, consecration, and walking in the way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But what is obedience?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Are you obedient just because you have left the denominations?!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are you consecrated because you have not cared for anything and left man's organization?!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Are you walking in the way because you have left the denominations?!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It seems that apart from these outward matters, nothing else requires obedience and consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is almost as if not being obedient only refers to not leaving the denominations or not being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are these outward matters our only testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In another aspect, we have seen the lack of growth among the churches in various places; there is laziness in the work, coldness for the gospel, almost no prayer life, a shortage of the power of the Holy Spirit, a lack of faith, and not enough love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All this should cause us to repent before God in sackcloth and ashes with fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must beg God to revive us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The spirit of Laodicea is among us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, our works are not blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Second, we do not have eyes to see ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Third, we do not have the faith to receive; rather, we proudly think that we lack nothing and are better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should ask ourselves what makes us different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Are we willing to accept God's call for overcomers and strive onward to accomplish God's complete plan?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are we merely a group of people who are better than the denominations and different from others?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Are we the same as the so-called Brethren?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should spend some time before God to answer these questions well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, brothers, we should know that our testimony is Christ as God's centrality and that our position is one of hoping to become overcomers of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Denominations and other outward matters are side issues.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we pay attention to them, we do not know God's centrality and the position of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, there is a great problem with the method.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we studied the question of the church, we already mentioned that this study is not our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was prepared merely because those who had already consecrated themselves to God did not know how to deal with this question.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have asked the co-workers many times to realize that a person can be taught the truth concerning the church only after he has completely consecrated himself to God, submitted to the Holy Spirit's authority in life, and refused the activities of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If he has done all these and has been enlightened by God to seek for understanding concerning the ground of the church, then we should tell him about the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After the meeting some brothers wanted the messages to be printed, but I refused because I was afraid that some ignorant ones would use them as messages to outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After the 1931 Overcomer Conference, I openly wrote in The Present Testimony, Issue No. 22:</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In our conferences our intention is only to speak forth the message of the victory of Christ, not to speak of other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The preaching of this message is our particular responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If there had not been some outside brothers raising some questions, perhaps we would have seen more spiritual accomplishments in this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In reality, unless a person knows God in the aspects of trusting and obeying Him, it is of little use to speak to him concerning other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can mention many other matters to those who are faithful, but if we share them with those who are yet unwilling to serve God faithfully, it will only give rise to disputes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is our desire that anyone's commitment concerning issues of the church or issues of prophecy would result from a spiritual background acquired in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We do not want any person to have an outward commitment in his stand concerning the church just because he has listened to our exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our Bible study meetings, on the other hand, are of a different nature: they are conducted for those who are willing to serve God faithfully and are seeking to have a clearer understanding of Bible truths.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For this reason, we are free in these meetings to bring up those things which we would be reluctant to bring up in conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We hope that in our future conferences, neither the speaker nor the listeners will bring up, either publicly or privately, any matters outside the victory of Christ, in order that we might have God's full blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In other words, the content of our preaching in the October conference was the same as what we have preached all these years in The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I deeply believe that those who have been taught in the presence of God know that The Present Testimony preaches a special message.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Just as we have not mentioned other matters in The Present Testimony, we have tried to avoid these same matters in our past as well as future conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This does not mean that other matters are not important; but it does mean that when men sincerely desire to receive the victory of Christ and to believe and obey the Lord, He will spontaneously direct their attention to these other external matters, and they will automatically obey.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There will not be the need for much exhortation from others, and there will not be many disputes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At this stage, if certain things are not clear to some, we would be most willing to help them in the Bible study meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We deeply sense that what the church of God urgently needs and what she absolutely must experience today is the victory of Christ the facts and principles which He declared through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this matter we need to be faithful and steadfast, and we need to preach it wholeheartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the past two or three years, however, our brothers have not endeavored to preach the Lord Jesus as 1 the Savior, 2 the overcoming life, 3 the Holy Spirit who fills man, 4 the Bearer of the cross, or 5 the Captain of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have not seen brothers leading people to experience these aspects, but we have seen brothers exhorting those who have different opinions concerning the ground of the church to leave the denominations, get baptized, and cover their heads!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This kind of work is very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Many people have been touched to obey the Lord and walk in the way because they know the error of the denominations; they have left the denominations to break bread with us!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We are full of those who have left the denominations but who do not know how Christ is the overcoming life, nor do they know the filling of the Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They do not know how to bear the cross and know even less about spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As a result, outsiders think that our testimony concerns nothing but leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Even we ourselves have forgotten our own commission and think that our testimony is indeed leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Dear brothers, we cannot allow this kind of situation to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Otherwise, we will only become another "Brethren Church," and we will never be witnesses to accomplish God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, the time has come and we must change.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we do not have faith and obedience, and do not know in our experience what overcoming, filling, self-denial, and warfare are, how can we testify concerning these matters for Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In that case, we will choose the easy matters, such as leaving the denominations, as our testimony!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Therefore, we must pursue the deep experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is not enough just to know Him as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We must gain the Lord personally as our overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must have the specific experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We must continually know the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>At the same time, we must help the church and the kingdom through spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we do not have these things, what do we have that is different from others apart from leaving the denominations?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should each be an overcomer before God so that we can be worthy to testify for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Brothers, perhaps my word is a little harsh, but what I say to you, I also say to myself.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I confess that many experiences are gained after a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Therefore, in these past few months, I have asked God to open the way for me so that I might be quiet and that I be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I also ask for God's grace again and hope that in the near future I can give a good testimony for God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>However, in this time of transition, I hope that the co-workers know that when they testify for God, they cannot leave out the five points mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I also want the brothers and sisters who have fellowship with us to know that every one of us must have these five points or we cannot stand in the position of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Our fellowship today should be a fellowship of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Dear brothers, if our testimony was only the gospel, we could just be revivalists.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If our position was only leaving the denominations, we could just join the "Brethren."</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But if our testimony is the "testimony of Jesus" Rev 19:10 , we should have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Only then can we hope to accomplish God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>From now on we must have a change in our work, our meetings, our testimony, and ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>To my knowledge, I am the first one who needs to be dealt with anew by God.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If God is gracious to me, I hope that in the near future I can secure a place just for cultivating and training believers.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This will serve as a new beginning in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Although we have decided on many things, we need to wait on God to accomplish them, so I do not want to say anything more here.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>One thing is certain: If we continue on in this way, we will not be very useful in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Just comparing oneself to man is not spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Even though our brothers and our meetings may be one step above those of others, we must remember that our current condition is still very far from God's plan!</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>It is not that I despise our brothers and sisters, nor do I depreciate many of the truths that we have preached, but we are far from God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If we do not want to be sifted out, we must pursue again.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Dear brothers, only you could allow me to write this kind of letter to you.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>I could never discuss these problems with others.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Thank you!</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Therefore, please allow me to ask that from now on we forbid our mouths from debating with others over outward matters.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>If we persuade someone concerning an outward matter, what has the Lord really gained and what have we really gained?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We must learn to discern between the camels and the gnats.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Please do not imitate the Pharisees in swallowing the camels and straining out the gnats.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Other things are more important, and we should pay attention to them first; we should pay attention to outward things last.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Therefore, I ask, brothers, let us please resolve to refuse to discuss questions about the denominations, etc., with anyone who has not completely consecrated himself to God and is not ready to walk in the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We can only speak of these outward matters with those who live in God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We must absolutely not make The Assembly Life a propaganda matter to outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We should not forget that our goal is not to build up our assemblies but to allow God to gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Is man's need life or fellowship with respect to the ground of the church ?</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Brothers, we must wake up.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>We should not despise the brothers who are already among us, nor should we deal with them strictly.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We must remember that our own spiritual condition is not very good.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>How can we place heavy requirements on them?</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>We can only strive to pursue deeper experiences and serve them in love.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Their future spiritual edification will depend on our pursuit of the Lord today.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Your brother,</S>

   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>We forgot who borrowed the entire manuscript of "God's Centrality" from Mr. Nee's Overcomer Conference in January of last year.</S>
