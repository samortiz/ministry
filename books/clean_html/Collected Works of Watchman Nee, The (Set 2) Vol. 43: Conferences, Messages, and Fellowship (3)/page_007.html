<h2 class="head1">THE REASON GOD INTERRUPTS MAN'S SPEAKING</h2><p>Let us consider the reason God interrupts man's speaking. Of all the books in the Old Testament, Job contains the greatest amount of man's speaking. There is not another book in the Bible that contains more speaking from man. The three friends of Job had much to say; they spoke unceasingly. Even Job spoke unceasingly, and at the end, Elihu opened his mouth to say many words. After Job's three friends finished speaking and after Job and Elihu finished speaking, God began to speak. There are forty-two chapters in Job. Most of them are man's speaking. God only speaks at the end. It seems as if God patiently endured their speaking. From this we can see that God is not only the God who speaks but also the God who listens.</p><p>God listened to the incessant speaking of Job and his friends, yet it seems that God did not have the same patience with Peter. Was it because God had become impatient? No, if God were impatient, He could have stopped Job and his friends while they were talking. God was not in haste to stop man's speaking. In reading the book of Job, we see that God likes to listen to man's talking. He can listen to man's talking. God interrupts man's speaking for a definite reason. Sometimes, God cannot allow man to continue speaking, because man will go astray. We should realize that God interrupts man's speaking not because He is impatient; He interrupts man's speaking because what is said should not be said. They are words that should not be heard, words that need to be stopped.</p><h2 class="head2">The Reason the Father Interrupted Peter</h2><p>Peter's speaking was interrupted first by God on the Mount of Transfiguration. After the Lord was transfigured before the three disciples, Moses and Elijah also appeared. If you had asked Peter on that day whether he would choose the law, the prophets, or Christ, Peter would have probably answered, "I cannot choose just one. I want all three." Peter, as well as many Christians, wanted to have the law and the prophets in addition to Christ. We all want to have regulations and help from spiritual ones. Christians may think that they have the Spirit living within and that they have Christ as power and life. But they also need outward statutes, regulations, laws, and help from others. This is man's thought; it is not God's way. God the Father spoke to Peter from heaven: "This is My Son, the Beloved. Hear Him!" This means that God will not tolerate our putting Christ on the same level with the law and the prophets. Today those who have not received Christ may want the law and the prophets. However, since we have received Christ, God will not tolerate the law and prophets.</p><p>What is the law? The law tells us what is right and wrong in an outward way, while Christ tells us what is right and wrong from within. The law is the outward fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; but Christ in us is the inward fruit of the tree of life.</p><p>Eight or nine years ago, I was at Kuling Mountain recovering from an illness. At that time I met an electrician who installed electric lights. He was not very literate. (Today he is able to read the Bible.) As I read the Bible daily, I would read portions of it to him. Later, he was saved. Not long after, I returned to Shanghai. I was somewhat worried about him because he drank quite a bit. Every night he had to drink. He could drink a few bottles of wine at one time without getting drunk. However, every time he drank, he could not stop until he was drunk. I was worried about what would happen after he had spent all his money on drinking. While I was still with him, I often wanted to urge him to stop drinking. But I did not say anything. After I returned to Shanghai, he came to visit me one day. I asked him how he was doing and whether or not he had experienced any temptations recently. He replied, "Mr. Nee, don't you know? I am a wino. I love drinking. After you left, my wife set the table with the food and wine on it. I wanted to drink, and I was getting ready to open my mouth to give thanks for the food. But I could not pray. I asked my wife to bring the Bible to me so that I could see what it said about drinking. I searched for a long time, but I could not find anything regarding the matter of drinking. I thought to myself, `It is a pity that Mr. Nee is not here. If he was, I could ask him.' Since I could not ask you and since my wife and I only knew bits and pieces of the Bible, I thought that it would not matter if I drank. I thought that God was not concerned about this matter, so I prepared a glass of wine. But I could not put the drink in my mouth. I had to ask my wife to take the wine away. Only then was I able to pray and take my supper. I was very puzzled. I told myself that when I went to Shanghai the next time, I would ask you for the reason."</p><p>I asked, "Why did you stop drinking?" He said, "I don't know why. All I know is that when I tried to drink, the `householder' in me would not allow it. Therefore, I did not drink." Then I said to him, "Yes, indeed, if the `householder' in you will not allow you to drink, you should not drink. From now on you have to listen to the speaking of the `householder' in you." "The householder forbids it" is the new testament. The new testament is just the living Christ in you. This is completely outside of the law and the prophets. If the Bible were just regulations, if there were no living Christ within you, nothing would work. If Mr. Nee were a prophet in Shanghai, everyone would have to come to Shanghai in order to know God's will. If one must search the law to know what is right and wrong, one must first know to how to read. Does this mean that a person who is unable to read cannot know God's will? Does this mean that one must find a prophet before he can know God's will? Thank God, those of us who can read the Bible are able to know God's will, and the villagers who cannot read the Bible are also able to know God's will, because Christ lives in them.</p><p>The Bible only gives us a general direction of how Christ guides us in an inward way. This kind of direction only gives us an outward standard, and while the Bible has many major functions, it cannot replace Christ. The electrician knew Christ; the Christ he knew was an indwelling Christ. This is the new testament. This is the salvation of Christ. We should listen to the speaking of the householder within just as the electrician did.</p><p>However, Peter was not this way. In addition to Christ, he had the law and the prophets. The new testament is not Christ plus the law and the prophets. The new testament is Christ replacing the law and the prophets. God's interruption of Peter's speaking was a declaration that Christ cannot be added to the law and the prophets. Rather, Christ replaces the law and the prophets. The law and the prophets are over. Today it is the living God, Christ, who lives in us. This is the new testament.</p><p>In traveling to many places, I have found that many Christians often say the right thing. For example, one person may say to another, "You must pray much regarding this matter to see whether or not the Lord will lead you in this way." The other person's response may be, "The Bible says nothing about this." Many people are like this. When situations arise, they deal with them according to the teachings in the Bible. Many people only want outward regulations; they do not care for the inward Christ. However, before finding out whether the Bible says something, we should first find out how Christ is leading us inwardly through the Spirit. Our life and work do not necessarily have to be guided by outward laws. Many people consider the Bible to be the most perfect law; they think that it tells us everything about "do's" and "don'ts," right and wrong. Actually the law for a Christian is not the Bible; the law is the Christ living within him. The Christ living in us is our law. If Christ in us says that something is right, it is right. If Christ in us says that something is not right, it is not right. Often before we read about a certain matter in the Bible, we already know inside how we should conduct ourselves. Some say that when the co-workers are not around, they have no one to consult with and are at a loss. But I say that it is better for the co-workers to not be around, because they can learn to consult the Spirit.</p><p>The fundamental difference between Christianity and Judaism is that Judaism emphasizes the outward law, whereas Christianity emphasizes one's personal contact with Christ. The new testament addresses what is right and what is wrong according to life. The new testament is a matter of touching the living Christ and receiving His inward leading. Please remember that in the new testament, once our inward, personal fellowship with Christ is taken away, everything else is futile and useless. Moses and Elijah are a glory of the past. They must not become a hindrance to the new testament. Both the law and the prophets need to be put aside. This is why God interrupted Peter's speaking. Peter had placed the law and the prophets on the same level as Christ.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we all have the same ability to accomplish God's will. The problem is that men will not listen to what Christ is saying inwardly. Instead, they study the Bible blindly or inquire of others. If a certain matter arises and one person says one thing, another says a second thing, and still another says a third thing, whose word should we take? I would ask, "How do you feel inwardly?" Why do we have to take the word of outward teachers? Today we must listen to the speaking of the Christ within us. God's interruption of Peter's speaking meant that the law and the prophets should not occupy any place in us.</p>
