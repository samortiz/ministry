<h2 class="head2">D. Maturing in the Divine Life</h2><p>The believers need to grow until they mature in the divine life by the maturing Spirit in their spirit enriched with Christ to be a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Col. 1:28; Eph. 4:13). We cannot mature without the proper supply, and this supply is the life-giving Spirit, who is the maturing Spirit in the believers&rsquo; spirit enriched with Christ. We can testify that our spirit is enriched with Christ. Eventually, we will be a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. In Ephesians 4:13 the word <i>fullness</i> refers to the Body of Christ. We have to be fully matured in order to be a fully grown man at the measure of the stature of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Conformed to the Image of Christ</h2><p>In God&rsquo;s organic salvation the believers will be conformed to the image of Christ the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29).</p><h2 class="head2">F. The Firstborn Son of God<br />Begotten by God in His Resurrection</h2><p> As the firstborn Son of God, Christ was begotten by God in His resurrection with both His divinity and His enlivened and uplifted humanity, possessing two natures, both divine and human (Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:4; 1 Pet. 3:18).</p><p>In resurrection Christ&rsquo;s humanity was sanctified, enlivened, uplifted, and transformed. Our humanity had become fallen and has been redeemed by Christ. His humanity did not need to be redeemed, but His humanity, which died on the cross, needed to be sanctified, enlivened, uplifted, and transformed. Through resurrection the Lord&rsquo;s dead humanity was sanctified, enlivened, uplifted, and transformed into the divine sonship. In resurrection He was begotten of God to be the firstborn Son of God both with His divinity and with His sanctified, enlivened, uplifted, and transformed humanity. The firstborn Son of God was therefore begotten of God with both divinity and humanity, and we are being conformed to His image.</p><h2 class="head2">G. The Consummation of Transformation</h2><p>The conformation of the believers is the consummation of their transformation in the divine life through which they participate in God&rsquo;s divinity in full.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SECRET OF GLORIFICATION</h2><p>Glorification is the eighth section of God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Believers Sealed with God&rsquo;s Spirit</h2><p>In regeneration God seals the regenerated believers with His Spirit (Eph. 1:13). When a piece of paper is sealed with ink, the ink saturates the paper. This is an illustration of the fact that the sealing of the Spirit involves the believers&rsquo; being saturated with the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Sealing Spirit Saturating the Believers</h2><p>The sealing of the sealing Spirit is like inking, saturating the sealed believers from within with the glorious life element of God throughout their life, resulting in the redemption of their body (Eph. 4:30; Rom. 8:23). Throughout our entire Christian life, this sealing, this &ldquo;inking,&rdquo; is saturating our being from within. With what does the sealing Spirit seal the believers? The Spirit is sealing them with the glory of the divine life. The glory of the divine life is the &ldquo;ink,&rdquo; and throughout the believers&rsquo; life this ink by the &ldquo;inking&rdquo; is saturating their entire being from within with the glorious life element of God.</p><p>Such a saturating will eventually result in the redemption of our body. Ephesians 4:30 tells us that we are sealed by the Holy Spirit &ldquo;unto the day of redemption.&rdquo; Here the word <i>unto</i> means &ldquo;resulting in&rdquo; or &ldquo;for.&rdquo; This sealing is for the redemption of our body and it will result in the redemption of our body. From the time we were saved and regenerated, the Spirit as the seal in us has been sealing us continually with the glorious life element of God unto the day of the redemption of our body.</p>
