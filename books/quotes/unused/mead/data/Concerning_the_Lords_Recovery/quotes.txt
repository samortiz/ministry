[2]  These messages cover the primary and crucial aspect of the Lord's recovery to recover the dispensing of the Triune God as life into His redeemed people in order that He may be fully expressed on the earth.
[3]  Most Christians consider the Lord's recovery only as a recovery of doctrines, practices, and spiritual experiences that have been damaged or lost such as justification by faith, a life of holiness, the presbytery, baptism by immersion, various aspects of the church life, etc. These are items of the Lord's recovery, but they are not the central matter.
[4]  The word recovery means that something was there originally, and then was lost.
[5]  If we don't have a clear vision of what God wants, what God desires to have, what God's intention is. we cannot know what the Lord's recovery is.
[6]  He is a purposeful God, and once He has made up His mind to do something, nothing can change His mind, and nothing can stop Him.
[7]  But after seventy years God came in to do a recovery work.
[8]  God came in to recover the thing that was lost.
[9]  In Catholicism hardly anyone knows the truth concerning Christ as our righteousness, Christ as our holiness, Christ as our life, Christ as our life supply.
[10]  According to the human mind, Martin Luther brought the reformation in. But actually in God's eyes he was used by God to recover only a part or one aspect of Christ.
[11]  When I was about twenty years of age I learned about this matter of recovery by reading the Bible and studying other Christian writings, especially among the Brethren.
[12]  Ephesians on the one hand tells us that we are builded together into a temple of God to express God, and on the other hand that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all Eph 2:21-22; 1:23 .
[13]  On the one hand the church is the dwelling place of God, and on the other hand the church should be the fullness of God.
[14]  In the Old Testament not too long after God had reached His goal to have such an expression, the completion of the building up of the temple, the enemy of God came in to ruin God's people from within.
[15]  When the temple was completed the glory of God came down and overshadowed the temple and filled the temple.
[16]  As long as the life matter is lost, the expression of God is gone.
[17]  The Lord's recovery is just to recover the expression of God.
[18]  The central recovery of the Lord is to recover the divine life within us that God may have His expression among His people.
[19]  In the last message we pointed out that the first time man is mentioned in the Bible it says that he was created in the image of God Gen 1:26, 27 .
[20]  Then God put this man before a tree which is called the tree of life, showing that God's intention was for man to eat of the tree of life so that he might enjoy and partake of the divine life of God.
[21]  In the son, Isaac, we can see a person who inherited and possessed and enjoyed all the riches of God typified by the good land.
[22]  The grandson of Abraham, Jacob, shows a person who was chosen and selected by God to a destiny, that is, to be transformed into a prince of God.
[23]  But such a one was transformed into a prince of God to execute God's government on this earth.
[24]  God brought His people out of the tyranny and slavery in Egypt to Mount Sinai where they received the revelation to build up the tabernacle of God on this earth.
[25]  Second, upon the sockets there were forty-eight standing boards plus four pillars in the front.
[26]  Once these things were finished God descended in His glory, first to overshadow the entire tabernacle, and second to enter into the tabernacle and fill it with His visible glory Exo 40:34 God was manifested in the tabernacle to make it the expression of God among His people on the earth.
[27]  When we get saved at the cross by receiving Christ as our trespass offering and sin offering, we realize at the same time that He is the One who satisfies God and pleases God.
[28]  Few realize at the time of their conversion that Christ is their burnt offering to God for God's satisfaction, and Christ is the meal offering for them to feed God and to feed themselves.
[29]  Very few realize how much they need the peace offering and how much they need to come into the fellowship with the saints around the Lord's table to enjoy Him with God and before God and with one another.
[30]  At the altar in the outer court you can enjoy the meal offering, but it is not so enjoyable as eating of the showbread at the table.
[31]  In John 6 we are told that Christ is the bread of life v. 35 , the bread from heaven v. 50 , the bread of God v. 33 , the living bread v. 51 , and the true bread v. 32 . This means that Jesus is the bread on the showbread table for us.
[32]  Unless you are in the expression of God, you could never enjoy Christ as the showbread on the table.
[33]  This kind of deeper experience would then send you to the incense altar to join with Christ and to be one with Him in His commission to intercede for God's economy.
[34]  We have to pass through all the things and to stay with Christ at the incense altar where we intercede with Christ and where we have Christ as the sweet incense burning unto God.
[35]  At the offering altar in the outer court we satisfy God, but at the incense altar we please God.
[36]  If we would participate in God's expression or be God's expression, we must have the full and adequate experience of Christ.
[37]  This expression began with individuals in the Old Testament.
[38]  So the Bible tells us that Christ is the image of the invisible God Col 1:15 .
[39]  God was man's portion, but in the fall man fell away from God and lost God, so man turned to his own invention, human culture.
[40]  While the Lord Jesus was on the earth He was with twelve disciples, and He had a very intimate time with them.
[41]  You have to put aside your culture, your religion, your ethical thought, and your tradition.
[42]  In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus went on to say, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."
[43]  Now we come to John 17:1 which says, "These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You."
[44]  In verse 21 He prayed, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, that the world may believe that You have sent Me."
[45]  When we live a life that is in the Son and the Father and a life letting the Son and the Father live in us, this life is the expression of God.
[46]  We were outside of the Triune God, but through baptism, we were baptized into the Triune God, into a spiritual and mystical union with Him.
[47]  Galatians 2:20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."
[48]  To have Christ formed in us means to have Christ saturate every part of our inner being our mind, our emotion, our will, our thinking.
[49]  Christ needs to be formed within you so that you can express God.
[50]  After His resurrection He came back to the disciples in another form.
[51]  Even today He is here, but He would not appear to us.
[52]  Thus far we have seen that our Redeemer, the Second of the Trinity, has become a life-giving Spirit.
[53]  It speaks of the Spirit of life 8:2 , the Spirit of God 8:9 , the Spirit of Christ 8:9 . the Spirit of the One who raised Christ from among the dead 8:11 , and eventually the Spirit 8:16 .
[54]  This means that God has put us into Christ that Christ might be our wisdom, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption.
[55]  Because Christ has become a Spirit, God could put us into this Spirit and this Spirit could be the wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption within us.
[56]  Not only is Christ Himself the temple, but all of us who are in Christ and who have Christ in us are the temple to contain God and to express God.
[57]  God exercises upon us this very power by which He raised up the Lord Jesus from the dead and exalted Him to the top of the universe, subduing and subjecting all things under His feet, and making Him the Head over all things to the church.
[58]  What He wants to recover is that the Father would strengthen us through the Spirit into our inner man, that the Son, the all-inclusive One, might make His home and get Himself fully settled into our heart, into every part of our inner being, so that our whole being will be filled unto the overflowing of the Triune God to become an expression of God.
[59]  Verses 22-24 of chapter four tell us that such a church which is mingled with the Spirit, one with the Lord, and saturated with the Triune God is being renewed.
[60]  Titus 3:5 and 6 read: "Not by works in righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy, He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, Whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior."
[61]  The book of Revelation is a continuation of what John revealed in his Gospel and in his Epistles.
[62]  The divine life is nothing less than the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as our life and our life supply.
[63]  First of all, at the end of this age God will have local churches on this earth which are lampstands.
[64]  The term local church is not mentioned in Revelation, but in 1:11 John writes to the seven churches in seven cities, indicating that seven churches are equal to seven cities.
[65]  John did not write to a street church or a home church or a community church or a church on the campus.
[66]  While He was on the earth He was a witness of God.
[67]  This means that the divine life has never been realized adequately and fully by a group of Christians.
[68]  THE TREE OF LIFE, THE MANNA, AND THE FEAST
[69]  The practicality of God's expression is not only in Revelation chapter one, but also in chapters two and three.
[70]  In these two chapters the Lord Jesus as the Son of Man who is in the midst of the churches as the lampstands does not only purify the churches that they may shine with pure light, but also promises to feed them with the tree of life 2:7 , the hidden manna 2:17 , and the feast 3:20 .
[71]  In the practicality of the local churches as God's expression today, the enjoyment of the rich Christ as our particular nourishment is needed that we may be transformed into precious stones for the building up of God's eternal dwelling place to express God.
[72]  In the Epistles it does say that Christ today is at the right hand of God Rom 8:34 , but the book of Revelation, according to the picture, shows us that God is in Christ.
[73]  In the past chapters we have covered the entire Bible and seen how man was created in God's image and how eventually man will be the total expression of God to express God thoroughly, fully, and eternally.
[74]  In the Gospel of John the Spirit uses two things to indicate that all the things given through Moses are fulfilled in this one Person, Jesus Christ.
[75]  These two things are the tabernacle in 1:14 and the Lamb of God in 1:29.
[76]  In the New Testament, first of all the church was set up and the New Testament writings came out to unveil the mysterious, all-inclusive Christ.
[77]  You have to realize that both the setting up of the church and the writing of the New Testament to unveil Christ became the very outward frame treasured by the Christians.
[78]  But history tells us that by God's mercy through all the centuries there was a line of the central things.
[79]  God's desire is to have a recovery of the Triune God dispensed into His redeemed people, so that He would become their being, and that this would issue into the church life.
[80]  This is why in the foregoing chapters we have pointed out from the Holy Scriptures, beginning with Genesis 1 and ending with Revelation 22 that God wants to have a people as His expression.
[81]  As we mentioned in the last chapter, Revelation covers the particular enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life, as the hidden manna, and as the feast.
[82]  These are the fulfillment of the tree of life in Genesis 2, the manna in Exodus 16, and the feast of the riches of the good land in Deuteronomy 12.
