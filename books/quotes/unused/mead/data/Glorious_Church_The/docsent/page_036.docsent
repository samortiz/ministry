   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>May God open our eyes so that we may not consider ourselves as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why were we saved?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Was it just so we should not go to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No. This is not the center.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why then did Christ want to save us?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can answer this question from two different viewpoints from man's viewpoint and from God's viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we view the same thing from two angles, it is seen in a different light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not just consider this matter from man's viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must see it from God's viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In fact, the recovery of man's loss is for the recovery of God's loss.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's loss must be recovered through the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today God has caused us to share the victory of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wherever the victory of the Lord Jesus is displayed, there Satan must leave.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must simply stand steadfast, because the Lord Jesus has already won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His redemptive work, the Lord Jesus destroyed all the legal ground of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All of Satan's legal rule has been terminated through redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Redemption was the sentence by which Satan was deprived of his legal position.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now the responsibility of executing this sentence is upon the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When God sees that the church has sufficiently fulfilled this task, the kingdom will come, and the new heaven and the new earth will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The new heaven and new earth in the book of Isaiah will lead to the new heaven and new earth in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today we are standing midway between redemption and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we look backward, we see redemption; when we look forward, we see the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our responsibility is twofold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, we must lead the people of the world to be saved, and on the other hand, we must stand fast for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Oh, may we have this vision so that we see the responsibility committed to the church by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us review what the kingdom of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The kingdom of God is the realm where God exercises His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must have such a kingdom among us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While we allow God to exercise His authority in the heavens, we must also allow Him to exercise His authority over us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God must have His authority, His power, and His glory among us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not only must we seek to live before God according to Ephesians 5, but we must also pursue the responsibility revealed to us in Ephesians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we will not only be a church which is glorious, holy, and without blemish, but we will also be those who have cooperated with God to bring in His kingdom and caused Satan to suffer loss on this earth.</S>
