	 <h2 class="head4">Keeping the Love for the Brothers</h2>
<p>The sixth epistle was written to the church in Philadelphia (vv. 7-13). <em>Philadelphia</em> means &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo; In this epistle, the Lord says, &ldquo;You have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name&rdquo; (v. 8). The believers kept the Lord&rsquo;s name and His word in love, and their situation was expressed in the love among the brothers. Overcomers love the brothers; this brotherly love is emphasized and explained in the Epistles of John. Our love for the brothers is not the human love of natural emotions but a pure love. This is the brotherly love in Philadelphia.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Not Being Self-satisfied</h2>
<p>Finally, the seventh epistle was written to the church in Laodicea (vv. 14-22). Laodicea was lukewarm and self-satisfied (vv. 16-17). When we think that we are sufficient, we have become self-satisfied. When we are self-satisfied, Christ is excluded. Moreover, lukewarmness also excludes Christ. When we are lukewarm, the Lord stands outside the door (v. 20). This door is not an individual door but a corporate door, the door of the church. Christ is outside, not inside, the church in Laodicea.</p>
<p>In order to be overcomers during the desolation of the church, we must hate lukewarmness. If we are satisfied because we have the light of the truth and blessing on our work, we are in the condition of Laodicea. The light of the truth and blessing on our work cannot replace the Lord; on the contrary, they may be a frustration to the Lord. If these things capture us and make us satisfied, the Lord will be outside the door.</p>
<p>We must seek the Lord. We should not love the Lord&rsquo;s work or His truth but rather enjoy the Lord Himself (v. 18). If we hear His voice, we should open the door, and He will come in to us and dine with us and we with Him. He will enjoy us, and we will enjoy Him (v. 20).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Needing to Love the Lord</h2>
<p>The promises in the last three epistles are related to the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The promise to Sardis says, &ldquo;They will walk with Me in white&rdquo; (v. 4); this is a matter of being with the Lord. The promise to Philadelphia says, &ldquo;Him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God&rdquo; (v. 12); this is also a matter of being with the Lord. The promise to Laodicea says, &ldquo;I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me&rdquo; (v. 20); this, too, is a matter of being with the Lord.</p>
<p>The seven epistles in Revelation should be divided into a group of three and a group of four, with the first three epistles forming one section and the last four forming another (see <em>Meditations on Revelation,</em> in <em>The Collected Works of Watchman Nee,</em> vol. 4, p. 270). However, according to their promises, the last three epistles are in the same category. The first four epistles show that the root of the desolation of the church is the losing of the first love for the Lord. The church fell to such an extent that the Lord left it, and it was filled with the things of the world, producing the church in Thyatira, the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, the last three epistles speak of the church in recovery. We must leave everything apart from the Lord. We must leave anything related to Catholicism and return to the first love for the Lord.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the seven epistles it speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s love, and at the end it speaks of the fellowship in love. These epistles show that, regardless of the extent of the desolation of the church and whether our circumstances are good or bad, we must simply love the Lord and desire Him alone. We should not desire anything apart from the Lord, such as idols or heresies. We should not be satisfied with having the Lord&rsquo;s blessing; only the Lord Himself should satisfy us. We should seek the Lord alone, love Him, and draw near to Him. We should learn to live before Him and enjoy Him as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and our food. We should be strong in the midst of weak, dying, and dead Sardis. We should love the brothers and the church, and we should have a genuine testimony. If we put the seven preceding points together, we can see the attitude, requirements, and conditions that we must have during the desolation of the church.</p>
<p>We should not take these epistles in a doctrinal way; rather, we should apply them to ourselves, examining and judging ourselves. The writer of these epistles is the One with eyes like a flame of fire and feet like shining bronze as having been fired in a furnace (1:14-15), and out of His mouth proceeds a sharp two-edged sword (v. 16). Each call to the overcomers is like a judgment. Each local church must prostrate itself before the Lord&rsquo;s throne in sackcloth and ashes, with sorrow and fasting, and pray to the Lord: &ldquo;Even if the majority of the believers fail, we would be the small number of Levites who carry the Ark and go on.&rdquo;</p>
