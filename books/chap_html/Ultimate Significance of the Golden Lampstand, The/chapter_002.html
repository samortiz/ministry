FOR THE CHURCH</h1>

<h2 class="head1">THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REVELATION<br />
CONCERNING THE GOLDEN LAMPSTAND</h2>
<p>The revelations in the Bible are progressive. Most of the revelations are sown as seeds in Genesis, they are developed little by little in the succeeding books, and they consummate in Revelation. We may say that in Genesis we have the seeds and in Revelation we have the harvest. The revelation concerning the golden lampstand, which is first mentioned in Exodus 25, is the same in principle. Here I must add a little word: The concept concerning the golden lampstand cannot be found in human history or in any human writings. It is a very particular matter. Not even an expert designer today could possibly create such a pattern. Hence, in the last several thousand years the golden lampstand has remained a unique matter which is not of human thought but of the divine conception. Therefore, this pattern is very special; it is one lampstand with seven lamps. Every item of this lampstand bears some spiritual meaning.</p>
<p>The golden lampstand is thoroughly covered in Exodus, but there is the need for further development. For example, in Exodus 25, the lampstand is spoken of as a beaten work of pure gold, but there is no mention of the oil. However, in Zechariah 4 something is added. It says that there are two olive trees by the sides of the lampstand, and at the end of chapter four the two olive trees are the two anointed ones. <em>Anointed ones</em> in Hebrew is translated <em>sons of oil.</em> These two anointed ones are two sons of oil, who are filled with oil. In Revelation 11, these two olive trees, the two anointed ones, the two sons of oil, are the two witnesses who are coming (vv. 3-4). After many believers are raptured to the heavens, the testimony of God on this earth will fall upon these two witnesses. We must see that the two witnesses in Revelation 11 are also two golden lampstands. The main point, however, is that in Exodus there is the golden lampstand but not the olive oil; it is in Zechariah 4 that the oil is mentioned. Concerning the lampstand with the two olive trees by its sides, the prophet Zechariah asks, &ldquo;What are these, sir?&rdquo; Then the angel answers, &ldquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says Jehovah of hosts&rdquo; (vv. 4, 6). This indicates that in Zechariah 4 the concept concerning the Spirit is brought in. In Exodus 25 there is only the concept concerning the gold&mdash;the golden lampstand&mdash;with no mention of the oil, but in Zechariah 4 the oil is mentioned. This oil is the Holy Spirit. First there is the golden lampstand, and then there is the olive oil (the Holy Spirit). Then in Revelation 1 we see that there is not just one golden lampstand but seven golden lampstands (v. 12). One has become many.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THREE STAGES OF THE SPEAKING<br />
CONCERNING THE GOLDEN LAMPSTAND</h2>
<p>The speaking concerning the golden lampstand in the Bible is in three stages: The first stage is the golden lampstand, the second stage is the golden lampstand with the olive oil (the Holy Spirit), and the third stage is the singular lampstand becoming the plural lampstands&mdash;one lampstand becoming many lampstands. This is very meaningful. In Exodus 25, the emphasis of the lampstand is on Christ; in Zechariah 4, the emphasis is on the Holy Spirit; and in Revelation 1, the emphasis is on the churches. All three passages mention the lampstand, but in the first passage Christ is emphasized, in the second passage the Holy Spirit is emphasized, and in the third passage the churches are brought forth.</p>
<p>How is the church brought forth? It is produced by having the Spirit in addition to Christ. Christ with the Spirit is the church as the golden lampstand. According to God&rsquo;s eternal desire, economy, or plan, the golden lampstand is not merely Christ or merely Christ with the Spirit; instead, the golden lampstand is Christ with the Spirit producing the church. The church is God&rsquo;s ultimate goal. God&rsquo;s plan is from Christ through the Spirit to the church. If there is Christ yet not the Spirit, God cannot carry out His plan; if there is Christ with the Spirit yet without the church, God has not yet reached the ultimate goal of His economy.</p>
<p>We need to see that when the lampstand is spoken of in the last book of the Bible, the emphasis is neither on Christ nor on the Spirit but on the church. Here I must speak a word that may make people unhappy; however, what is true is true and what is false is false, and what is good is good and what is bad is bad. I would be glad to say something good about others, and sometimes I have made up my mind and resolved that I would not mention Christianity in my preaching. However, while I am giving a message, I cannot help mentioning it because the anointing anoints me to do so. In the divine revelation, first there is Christ, then the Spirit, and eventually the church. However, is the reality of the church in today&rsquo;s Christianity? Absolutely not. Therefore, Christianity is really pitiful. There is even a group of so-called seekers of spirituality who say, &ldquo;We only care for Christ; we don&rsquo;t care for the church.&rdquo; This has become their slogan. They want Christ but not the church; this means that they want Exodus but not Revelation. Does Revelation speak about Christ or the church? John did not say, &ldquo;I turned and saw Christ.&rdquo; Rather, he said, &ldquo;When I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands&rdquo;; he also said, &ldquo;And in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man&rdquo; (vv. 12-13). This is a complete vision.</p>
