In Hebron</H2><P>When David inquired of Jehovah whether he should go up into one of the cities of Judah, Jehovah told him to go up to Hebron. David went to Hebron, bringing up his men who were with him and their households. They dwelt in the cities of Hebron, and there in Hebron the men of Judah anointed David king over the house of Judah (2:1-4a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. At the Age of Thirty</H2><P>According to 5:4 David was thirty years of age when he began to reign.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C.

Gaining the Men of Jabesh-gilead<br>Who Had Buried Saul</H2><P>David gained the men of Jabesh-gilead who had buried Saul (vv. 4b-7). When David was informed concerning what they had done, he sent messengers to them, telling them that they were blessed of Jehovah for showing this kindness to Saul and promising to repay them for this good thing which they had done. In this way David gained these men of Jabesh-gilead.</P>
