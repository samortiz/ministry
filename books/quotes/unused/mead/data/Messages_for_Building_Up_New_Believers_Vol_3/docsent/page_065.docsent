   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Difference between Satan s Accusation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and the Holy Spirit s Reproach</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the difference between Satan s accusation and the Holy Spirit s reproach?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to distinguish between them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, all reproaches from the Holy Spirit begin with a small feeling from within.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This inner feeling becomes stronger and stronger and convicts us of our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan s accusation, however, is a continual nagging within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reproach of the Holy Spirit grows stronger and stronger as time goes on; the accusation of Satan is the same from beginning to end. As time passes, the inner sense of the Spirit ascends by degree; but the accusation of Satan is a constant, muddled nagging that stays the same from beginning to end.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second, each time we yield to the rebuke of the Spirit, we find the power of sin diminishing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Each rebuke of the Spirit diminishes the power of sin a little.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, any rebuke from the Spirit weakens the power of sin; it results in a diminishing of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not the case with Satan s accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every time he accuses us, we find the power of sin to be just as great as before.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Third, the reproach of the Holy Spirit brings us to the Lord, whereas Satan s accusation brings us disappointment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we are reproved by the Holy Spirit, the more we are strengthened within to deal with our problem before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But Satan s accusation brings about despair and resignation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reproach of the Holy Spirit causes us to come before the Lord and to rely on Him; Satan s accusation causes us to turn back to ourselves and to be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Fourth, if it is the reproach of the Holy Spirit, confession before the Lord will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This confession will result in at least peace, if not joy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There may or may not be joy, but there is always peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan s accusation, however, is totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no joy and no peace, even after one confesses his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is like coming out of a major illness or going through a theatrical performance nothing remains after the act is over.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reproach of the Holy Spirit has a result peace, if not joy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, Satan s accusation leads us nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fifth, the reproach of the Holy Spirit reminds us of the blood of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With Satan s accusation, there is always the Satan-injected thought: There is not much use.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps the Lord will not forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This thought will be there even when we know that we have the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In other words, the reproach of the Holy Spirit leads to faith in the Lord s blood, while Satan s accusation causes us to lose our faith in the Lord s blood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a certain feeling comes, simply check whether we are reminded of the blood as a result of this feeling or whether we have been distanced from the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This will tell us whether the feeling is a reproach of the Holy Spirit or an accusation from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sixth, the result of the reproach of the Holy Spirit is power from God; one will rise up on his feet and run faster.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He will go on with renewed zeal, cast aside his trust in himself, and have more faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the result of Satan s accusation is the debilitation of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The conscience of such ones is smitten before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They have no faith in themselves, and they have no faith in God either.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is true that the reproach of the Holy Spirit takes away our strength and our trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But at the same time it causes us to have more faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Satan s accusation is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It takes away our confidence in ourselves as well as our faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The result is that we become a debilitated person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How to Overcome Satan s Accusation</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Revelation 12:11 says, And they the brothers overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Him here refers to Satan, who accused the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How do we overcome him?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First, we overcome by the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the one hand, when we sin before the Lord, we must confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the other hand, we must say to Satan, There is no need for you to accuse me!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I come before the Lord today by the blood of the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To overcome Satan, we must show him that we are forgiven through the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All our sins, major or minor, have been forgiven through the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the Word of God: The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must realize that the blood of the Lamb is the basis of our forgiveness before God as well as the basis of our acceptance in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not be so presumptuous as to think that we are good.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Neither should we be so foolish as to condemn ourselves from morning to evening.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is foolish to be proud, and it is also foolish to keep looking at oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those who consider themselves to be good are foolish, and those who are blind to the saving power of the Lord are foolish as well.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who believe in their own power are foolish, and those who do not believe in the Lord s power are foolish as well.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must see that the blood of the Lamb has already fulfilled all the demands of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It has also overcome all the accusations of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Second, we overcome because of the word of our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This word of our testimony declares the spiritual facts; it declares the victory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must tell Satan, There is no need for you to trouble me!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>My sins have been forgiven through the Lord s blood!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to exercise our faith to declare that Jesus is Lord and that He has won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to speak out the word of our testimony and let Satan hear this word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must not only believe in our hearts but also declare it to Satan with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the word of our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Third, we must not love our soul-life even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony spoken of previously are two conditions for victory over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The refusal to love one s soul-life even unto death is an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>No matter what Satan is doing, even if he is putting us to death, our attitude should be such that we still trust in the blood of the Lamb and still declare His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Satan s accusation will stop if we stand fast in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He cannot overcome us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Instead, we will surely overcome him!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some brothers and sisters receive so much accusation from Satan that they can no longer discern whether it is an accusation from Satan or a reproach of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They should stop confessing their sins for a while; the Lord does not want us to do things foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Instead, they should pray to the Lord and say, If I have sinned, I will confess my sins and ask for Your forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But now I am under Satan s accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I pray that You cover all my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>From this point on, everything is under Your blood, and I will not be bothered by anything anymore, whether it be sin or otherwise!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Those who are in such a condition must forget about everything for a while before they can differentiate clearly between Satan s accusation and the Holy Spirit s reproach.</S>
