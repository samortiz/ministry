As such, the law is God's testimony (16:34; 31:18; 32:15; 40:20; Psa. 19:7), God's expression, a revelation of God to His people (see notes 12 in John 1 and 11, par. 1, in Heb. 1). The law of God reveals God's attributes, showing that He is jealous (vv. 4-6; cf. 2 Cor. 11:2), holy (vv. 7-11), loving (vv. 6, 12-15; cf. Rom. 13:8-10; Gal. 5:14), righteous (v. 5), truthful (v. 16; cf. 1 John 1:5-6), and pure (vv. 2-3; 17). As the word of God and the testimony, the expression, of God, the law is a type of Christ as God's Word and God's testimony, God's expression (John 1:1, 18; Rev. 19:13; 1:5; Col. 1:15).<br>The reality of keeping the law is to live God and express God. Such a living, a living in the eternal economy of God, is the living of a God-man, a life of continually denying the self and being crucified to live Christ, who is God's testimony, by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ for the enlarged and expanded expression of God (Matt. 16:24; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:19-21a; Rom. 8:4).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

He is both God and man-a God-man. That the acacia wood was overlaid with gold both inside and outside signifies the divine nature mingled with the human nature-God and man becoming one-without a third nature being produced by the mingling. It also signifies that the divine nature penetrates the human nature and rests on the human nature so that it may be expressed through the human nature.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

And He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him; And He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things; For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell And through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross-through Him, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens. And you, though once alienated and enemies in your mind because of your evil works, He now has reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and without reproach before Him; If indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast and not being moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, of which I Paul became a minister.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
