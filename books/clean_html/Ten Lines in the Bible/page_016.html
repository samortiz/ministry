<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LINE OF LIFE</h1>
<p>When we open the Bible and read at the very beginning in the book of Genesis, we see a very striking item&mdash;the tree of life. When we read through to the end of the Bible, in the book of Revelation we once again see the tree of life. In the beginning of the Bible the tree of life is present, in the middle there are stories of life, and at the end the tree of life is still present. From this we should realize that the biblical revelation regards life as its center and its line. Now we will briefly touch the key points on the line of life in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. LIFE BEING THE CENTER<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S CREATION</h2>
<p>The more we read the record of God&rsquo;s creation in Genesis 1 and 2, the more we should realize that the center of God&rsquo;s creation is life. Although it seems like many things should be mentioned concerning God&rsquo;s creation, the account in Genesis 1 and 2 is very simple; it simply speaks of the aspects of God&rsquo;s creation that pertain to life. All of the criticism by scientists about the book of Genesis is really misplaced because the account in Genesis is not a complete record of God&rsquo;s creation but merely a record of the portion concerning life.</p>
<p>Now let us speak briefly about Genesis 1 and 2. Genesis 1:2 describes the earth, prior to God&rsquo;s further creation, as being &ldquo;waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep.&rdquo; These words fully convey a scene of death. Waste is related to death; darkness is related to death; even the deep water is related to death. In other words, initially everything there was related to death. In this situation, God began His work of re-creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Spirit Coming</h2>
<p>The Spirit of God brooded upon the surface of the waters. According to the principle in the Bible, whenever the Spirit comes, it is for created beings to receive life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Light Coming</h2>
<p>Whenever the Bible speaks of light shining, it is for man to receive God&rsquo;s life into him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Light Being Separated from Darkness</h2>
<p>In order to have life, light must be separated from darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. That Which Is Above Being Separated<br />
from That Which Is Under</h2>
<p>In order to have life, the things which are above must also be separated from the things which are under.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Dry Land Being Separated from the Waters</h2>
<p>The dry land was separated from the waters in order that the dry land could bring forth life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Life Coming Forth</h2>
<p>At this point, all kinds of life were brought forth from the earth. The bringing forth of different kinds of life involved a definite sequence, and all of these kinds of life have symbolic meanings.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Lowest Life&mdash;<br />
the Created Life without Consciousness</h2>
<p>Plants were the first things that grew on the earth. Plant life is without consciousness. A leaf of grass, a tree, or a flower contains life, but this life is without consciousness; it can neither think nor feel.</p>
<p>After the plant life came forth, the light bearers came&mdash;the sun, the moon, and the stars. The appearance of these stronger lights was not for producing life but for strengthening life so that life could grow. Hence, immediately after these lights came forth, a higher life appeared. The stronger the light, the more life grows.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Lower Life&mdash;<br />
the Created Life with the Lowest Consciousness</h2>
<p>Next, the living creatures in the water were produced. This kind of living creature has some consciousness, but it is the lowest consciousness. Even though this life is a little higher than the plant life, it is still a relatively lower life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Slightly Higher Life&mdash;<br />
the Created Life with Low Consciousness</h2>
<p>Gradually, living creatures in the air came into existence. Their life is higher than the life of the living creatures in the water, but the consciousness of this life is still relatively low.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Higher Life&mdash;<br />
the Created Life with Higher Consciousness</h2>
<p>Next, cattle and beasts on the earth came into existence. As the consciousness of the life increases step by step, the level of life also increases step by step.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Superior Life&mdash;<br />
the Created Life with the Highest Consciousness</h2>
<p>Lastly, man was created as the center of the universe. Among all the creatures, man has the highest life with the highest consciousness, a consciousness that is higher than all other creatures. However, in the whole universe, man does not have the highest consciousness nor the highest life; God has the highest life with the highest consciousness.</p>
<p>In summary, we can see clearly that the center of God&rsquo;s creation is life. God first created inanimate things and then living creatures. Then, with regard to the living creatures, He began by creating the lowest living creatures, going up level by level to the highest living creatures.</p>
