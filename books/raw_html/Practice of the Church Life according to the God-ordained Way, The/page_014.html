<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Since 1984 the Ministry Has Changed<br>from Life and Life Supply to Budgets, Numbers, Activities, and Other Practices, and This Change Has Affected the Nature of the Recovery</H2><P>The dissenting ones also said that since 1984 the ministry has changed from life and life supply to budgets, numbers, activities, and other practices, and this change has affected the nature of the recovery. This kind of word was sounded out the most strongly in Europe. They told people that before 1984 Witness Lee was right, but after 1984 he is wrong because he does not teach anything concerning life. Then, at the end of 1988, one of the four leaders of the conspiracy spoke the same words to a group of brothers in San Diego. Those who have heard my speaking since 1984 can testify what a lie this is. Such a lie was part of the strategy of the dissenting ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Concerning the Teaching of the Ministry</H2><P>The dissenting brothers also raised a problem concerning the teaching of the ministry. In Acts 2:42, Luke, the writer of that book, used the expression the teaching of the apostles. Our interpretation of this expression is that the teaching of the apostles comprises the four Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and the book of Revelation; that is, the entire New Testament is the teaching of the apostles. Whatever we teach must be according to the New Testament, which is the teaching of the apostles. If so, our teaching also is the apostles' teaching. However, the dissenting ones said that the teaching of the apostles mentioned in Acts 2:42 refers only to the four Gospels, to what the Lord Jesus taught the twelve apostles and charged them to teach to the future new believers. My response to this is that the teaching of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels is a part of the teaching of the apostles, but it is not the totality of that teaching. In John 16, while the Lord Jesus was teaching the disciples, at one point He said that He had yet many things to say to them, but they were not able to bear them at that time; but when the Spirit of reality came, He would disclose these things to them (vv. 12-15). This indicates that the Lord had many things to teach Peter and the others, but that was not the proper time. The Lord waited until the Spirit came to disclose the deeper things to some of the disciples. To whom were these deeper things disclosed? Surely they must have been disclosed mainly to the apostle Paul. In Colossians 1:25 Paul said that his ministry was to complete the word of God. God's plan, God's economy, was not revealed mainly to Peter. It was revealed mainly to the apostle Paul and recorded in his fourteen Epistles.</P><P>If the four Gospels are the teaching of the apostles, all the Epistles should also be the teaching of the apostles. This is the proper interpretation of the Bible. Now, if whatever we speak is according to the New Testament, our teaching also is the apostles' teaching; it is not our teaching. If it is our own teaching, then it is something other than the apostles' teaching. In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul told Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach different things, things that are different from God's economy. In their deviating speaking concerning the teaching of the ministry, the intention of the dissenters is nothing else than to put my ministry aside.</P>
