   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In addition to the above reasons, another reason for fighting with Satan is to be delivered from his deceptions and to deliver those who are deceived by him see Section Eight, Chapter Three and Section Nine, Chapter Four .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although believers become keen in their spirit's intuition when they experience the baptism of the Holy Spirit, this is not sufficient to protect them from the wiles of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They can still be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After one has spiritual feelings, he still needs spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he does not understand the leading of the spirit and remains in a passive position, he will become a prisoner of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At this time, believers very easily fall into the error of ignoring the leading in their spirit and following irrational feelings or experiences, thinking that these are from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After a believer has been baptized in the Holy Spirit, he enters into a supernatural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he does not realize his own weakness and that he is no match for supernatural things, he will be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A believer's spirit can be affected by two sources: 1 the Holy Spirit and 2 evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a believer thinks that his spirit can only be directed by the Holy Spirit and not be affected by evil spirits, he is very wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A believer should understand that besides the Spirit from God, there is also "the spirit of the world" 1 Cor 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the spiritual enemy mentioned in Ephesians 6:12.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Unless a believer closes his spirit to reject them, evil spirits will take hold of his spirit through deceptions, disguises, and counterfeits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a believer is fully spiritual, he will be affected by the supernatural world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At this time, it is very important for him to know the difference between "spiritual" and "supernatural."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Confusing these two things has led many believers into Satan's deceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Spiritual experiences are experiences that originate from the believers' spirit; supernatural experiences do not necessarily come from man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes they are felt in the senses of the body, and sometimes they are found in the realm of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Believers should never take supernatural experiences as spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They should study their experiences and find out if these experiences come from the outward senses or the spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Things that come from outside may be supernatural, but they are not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Believers should never accept anything supernatural without first questioning it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Besides God, Satan can also perform supernatural things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever feeling, appearance, or declaration there may be, a believer has to study the source.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One must practice the teaching of 1 John 4:1.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The counterfeiting efforts of Satan are often beyond the believers' expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a believer is willing to humble himself and acknowledge the possibility of being deceived, he will save himself from many deceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of these deceptions, spiritual warfare becomes unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In spiritual warfare if believers do not exercise their spirit to advance in attack, the enemy will come to them and suppress their spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Spiritual warfare is a battle between the believers' spirit and the evil spirits of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a believer is under deception, his warfare is a battle for freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a believer is free already, his warfare is a battle for the deliverance of others, for guarding himself and others against the enemy's attacks, and for taking an aggressive stand to oppose all of Satan's plans and works.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of warfare is a warfare of spirits; spiritual strength is required for such warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A believer must understand how he can wrestle with the enemy by his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without the spirit working for him, he does not know how the enemy attacks and how God wants him to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If he walks according to the spirit, he will learn to work by praying unceasingly in his spirit and opposing the enemy in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every time a believer's spirit goes through a battle, it becomes stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If he understands the law of the spirit, he can see that he not only overcomes sin, but Satan as well.</S>
