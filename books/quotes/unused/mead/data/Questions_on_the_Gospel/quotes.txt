[2]  This book, Questions on the Gospel, was published by Watchman Nee around 1934.
[3]  Does grace mean: 1 Giving man what he deserves?
[4]  1 Grace is not a matter of giving man what he deserves.
[5]  Romans 4:4 says, "Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due."
[6]  4 Grace is not a matter of giving less because man does not deserve it.
[7]  God has not overlooked the problem of man's sin.
[8]  In dealing with sin, God is very strict, definite, and thorough.
[9]  The Bible does not say that God forgives sinners because He is tolerant, plays deaf, or is careless.
[10]  Romans 5:21 says, "In order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[11]  For God to give us grace does not mean that God is generous to forgive our sins in a loose way.
[12]  7, 9; "cleanses us from every sin" and "cleanse us from all unrighteousness" means all ; 3 before he confesses his sins, God is willing to forgive him because the Lord Jesus is his Advocate before God 2:1-2 ; and 4 God forgives and cleanses him because, on the one hand, God is faithful and righteous and, on the other hand, the Lord Jesus is the Righteous One.
[13]  According to the Bible, what is the difference between "transgression" and "iniquity"?
[14]  Is there any difference between "blessed" in Romans 4:7 and "blessed" in verse 8?
[15]  Verse 7 says that God forgives man's iniquities and covers his sins, while verse 8 says that God works to such an extent that a man can be regarded as though he had never sinned: "by no means account sin."
[16]  Is the purification of our sins carried out only once or many times?
[17]  In Leviticus 4:1-7, why was the blood of the sin offering brought to the tabernacle of the congregation and sprinkled seven times before the veil of the sanctuary before God; according to the law of the cleansing of the lepers in Leviticus 14:1-7, the blood was sprinkled upon the lepers seven times?
[18]  How are the words sin and sins used differently in the Bible?
[19]  To "take away sins" in Hebrews 10:4 refers to the taking away of sins plural .
[20]  In Hebrews 10:2, "Would have no longer had the consciousness of sins" is also sins plural .
[21]  Why do we no longer have consciousness of sins after the Lord's blood has cleansed our conscience?
[22]  Our conscience accuses us of sins plural , specific sins, such as temper, pride, etc., before God.
[23]  Since the blood of the Lord Jesus has obtained for us the forgiveness of these sins, our conscience is no longer conscious of sins.
[24]  "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf" 2 Cor 5:21 .
[25]  The Lord Jesus was made sin not sins for us.
[26]  His becoming sin means that God dealt with Him as God would deal with our problem of sin.
[27]  Are we saved by God's grace or by God's righteousness?
[28]  What part of salvation is accomplished by God's grace, and what part is by God's righteousness?
[29]  God's grace provides a Savior for us, so that we have the possibility of being saved John 3:16 , while God's righteousness causes salvation to be accomplished upon us, so that God must save us.
[30]  QUESTION NINE CONCERNING THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD AND CHRIST
[31]  What is the meaning of each, and what is the difference between them?
[32]  Romans 3:25 and 26 say, "Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus."
[33]  What is the difference between the righteousness of Christ and Christ as righteousness?
[34]  "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."
[35]  In this way, God accepts us as He accepts Christ, and God considers us perfect even as Christ is perfect.
[36]  What aspect of God is revealed by the persecution of the Lord Jesus?
[37]  The Lord Jesus' persecution expresses the love of God, and His being put to death expresses the righteousness of God.
[38]  Why, in God's plan of redemption, must Christ be both God and man at the same time?
[39]  Suppose there are three persons: A, B, and C. Person C has sinned, and A asks B to die for C. This would show that A has love toward C, and that C has answered the requirements of the law; however, this is rather unjust to B. I sinned, and God caused Christ to die for me.
[40]  Why does Romans 5:18 say, "One offense one righteous act," yet verse 19 says, "The disobedience of one man the obedience of the One"?
[41]  Does our salvation have a direct relationship to His keeping of the law?
[42]  How do we "establish the law" through faith Rom 3:31 ?
[43]  Prior to believing in the Lord, everyone is bound by the law.
[44]  How did Christ fulfill the law and the prophets Matt 5:17 ?
[45]  On the cross the Lord has borne the curse of the law for us.
[46]  Since we have received life by accepting the Lord's work on the cross, we should also walk according to the Lord's commands on the mount in our living on earth.
[47]  Some people say that what the Lord spoke on the mount was all law and no grace.
[48]  No, they do not because Christians are not under the law but under grace Rom 6:14 .
[49]  During the apostles' time, a few people taught the brothers saying that if they were not circumcised according to Moses' law, they could not be saved.
[50]  Peter answered them saying, "Therefore why are you now testing God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
[51]  Can Galatians 3:21 be read as follows: "Is then the law against the promises of God?
[52]  If we say that the Lord Jesus shed His blood as a price to pay the devil to redeem us, we are, similarly, saying that God acknowledges the legality of man falling into the devil's hand.
[53]  Does Romans 2:12 say that a man will not perish if he does not have the law which means God has not given him the law and commits sin?
[54]  Will a sinner still end up in perdition if he has never heard the gospel?
[55]  We are saved not because God is obligated to save us, but because God extends special grace to us.
[56]  Since the basis of salvation is the death of Christ, why does the Bible tell us to believe not only in His death but also in His resurrection?
[57]  On the cross Christ said, "It is finished," indicating that the work of the cross was complete.
[58]  Why then could we still not be saved if He had not resurrected?
[59]  QUESTION TWENTY-TWO CONCERNING 1 CORINTHIANS 15:3 AND 17
[60]  First Corinthians 15:3 says that Christ died for our sins.
[61]  Why does verse 17 say that if Christ has not been raised, we are yet in our sins?
[62]  QUESTION TWENTY-THREE CONCERNING BELIEVING IN THE SON OF GOD
[63]  Why does the Bible tell us to believe in the Son of God?
[64]  What is the most crucial miracle in the Old Testament?
[65]  Adam was created by God not born of God; Christ was born of God not created by God.
[66]  What does it mean to be justified by the blood?
[67]  There are two aspects to the crucifixion of Christ: being crucified by man and being crucified by God.
[68]  Acts 2:23 and 36 and 3:15 speak of being crucified by men, while Isaiah 53:6 and 10 speak of being crucified by God.
[69]  Which part of Christ's crucifixion was done by man and which part was done by God?
[70]  When we read the Bible, we can clearly see that the crucifixion of Christ involves the matters of man crucifying Him and God crucifying Him.
[71]  From the seven sentences spoken by the Lord on the cross, we can understand which part of the crucifixion was done by man and which part was done by God.
[72]  After the Lord Jesus had spoken these three sentences, there was darkness over all the land.
[73]  God heard the prayer of the Lord, and He laid all the sins of the world upon the Lord Jesus.
[74]  God not only saves us according to His grace; He also saves us according to His righteousness.
[75]  God not only has mercy on us; He also paid the price for us and repaid everything we ever owed.
[76]  Colossians 1:24 says, "Fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ."
[77]  What is the difference between Christ dying for us Rom 5:8 and Christ dying for our sins 1 Cor 15:3 ?
[78]  The meaning of Christ dying for us is that Christ died for us as sinners.
[79]  In God's redemption, do Christians exchange their position with Christ?
[80]  In other words, did the righteous Christ become unrighteous and are unrighteous sinners made righteous 2 Cor 5:21 ?
[81]  Although we often say that we were sinful and that we were saved only because Christ died instead of us, we need to know that this expression refers exclusively to what we personally attained.
[82]  No. Do we become righteousness in Him? No. Instead of these, we "become the righteousness of God in Him." We should not only pay attention to the words "in Him" but also to the words "the righteousness of God." Christ was not made sin on our behalf in order to make us righteous and no longer sinners.
[83]  When were we united with Christ on the objective side, and when were we united with Him on the subjective side?
[84]  We were united with Christ objectively at the time Christ died on the cross: "One died for all, therefore all died" 2 Cor 5:14 .
[85]  Why does the Bible say that we are "in the Lord," "in Christ," and "in Christ Jesus," but never "in Jesus" or "in Jesus Christ"?
[86]  Although 1 Thessalonians 4:14 says in Chinese, "So also those who have fallen asleep in Jesus," it should be translated according to the Greek as follows: "So also those who have fallen asleep through Jesus."
[87]  There is no place in the Bible where we can find a phrase such as in Jesus or in Jesus Christ.
[88]  Jesus Christ means that the lowly Jesus is the One who is the Christ, while Christ Jesus means that the One who is now Christ is the One who was Jesus.
[89]  Was it between the time He was put on the cross and the time He expired, or was it at the very moment He expired?
[90]  QUESTION THIRTY-FOUR CONCERNING THE BLOOD AND THE CROSS
[91]  What is the difference between the significance and function of the blood and the significance and function of the cross?
[92]  Because some may ask, "Since sins have been taken away before God, why is sin still with us?", we ought to pay attention to this question in order to eliminate any doubt.
[93]  When we read Numbers 20:2-9 and 21:4-9, we realize how bad the children of Israel were when they were in the wilderness.
[94]  Yet Numbers 23:21 says, "He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob; /Nor has He seen trouble in Israel./Jehovah their God is with them,/And the shout of a king is among them."
[95]  We must note that there are two aspects to dealing with sin: one is before God, and the other is in us.
[96]  The Bible says that the Lord Jesus died for everyone.
[97]  Will a person perish if he does not believe in the Lord Jesus?
[98]  "For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died" 2 Cor 5:14 .
[99]  Since the Lord Jesus' death is a death for all, it might seem that a person will not have to die even if he does not believe in the Lord Jesus.
[100]  QUESTION THIRTY-SIX CONCERNING JOHN 1:12-13 AND REVELATION 22:17
[101]  How can we reconcile John 1:12-13, which says that receiving life is not of the "will of man," and Revelation 22:17, which says that whosoever will can take life?
[102]  Does Luke 10:25-37 indicate that a person inherits eternal life because he loves the Lord his God with all his heart, with all his soul, with all his strength, with all his mind, and by loving his neighbor as himself?
[103]  If so, is not inheriting eternal life dependent upon works?
[104]  When we believe, we have eternal life; when we believe, we are saved; and when we believe, we are justified, etc. In Luke 10 a certain lawyer asked, "What should I do to inherit eternal life?" The Lord said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?" The lawyer replied, "You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind, and your neighbor as yourself." Then the Lord said to him, "You have answered correctly; do this, and you shall have life." The law teaches two things: to love God and to love man.
[105]  In the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16, was the rich man's perdition a result of enjoying good things in his lifetime?
[106]  QUESTION THIRTY-NINE CONCERNING ROMANS 4 AND JAMES 2
[107]  Romans 4 says that Abraham was justified by faith, and James 2 says that Abraham was justified by works.
[108]  How do we explain these two kinds of justification?
[109]  Romans proves that a sinner cannot be justified by the works of law.
[110]  Galatians proves that a believer cannot be sanctified by the works of law.
[111]  We are both justified by faith and sanctified by faith.
[112]  Verse 21 says, "Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?"
[113]  If James had not referred to this instance of Abraham, some might have considered that he was wrong, after reading the books of Romans and Galatians.
[114]  Since Paul spoke of justification by faith, they might have assumed that just believing is enough and there is no need for any works.
[115]  QUESTION FORTY CONCERNING THE THREE PARABLES IN LUKE 15
[116]  QUESTION FORTY-ONE CONCERNING CHRIST AND THE HOLY SPIRIT
[117]  What is the relationship between the death of the Lord Jesus and the descending of the Holy Spirit?
[118]  Let us consider 2 Corinthians 5:18-20: "But all things are out from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation; namely, that God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them, and has put in us the word of reconciliation.
[119]  On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God."
[120]  What are the requirements for salvation, that is, for receiving eternal life?
[121]  Some people think that in order to be saved we must believe and then implore God earnestly, hoping that God will pity us and have mercy on us so that we might go to heaven.
[122]  Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes v. 4 . Faith is the requirement for obtaining righteousness, but what is this faith? The previous verses say that the word is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart, and that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
[123]  Although God saves us unto good works, that is, we have been "created in Christ Jesus for good works" Eph 2:10 and "prepared unto every good work" 2 Tim 2:21 , nevertheless, we must remember that the Bible tells us that good works come after being saved.
[124]  Some may rightly think that salvation is not dependent on hope, confession, works, or prayer, but still think that one must both believe and be baptized in order to be saved.
[125]  Can someone who commits such a sin be saved?
[126]  What does it mean to fall from grace Gal 5:4 ?
[127]  Can the ones who have fallen from grace be saved?
[128]  However, a danger developed among them; some said that even though the beginning of man's salvation is by faith in Christ, by the moving of the Holy Spirit, and by the grace of God, once he is saved, he can only please God by keeping His law and trying his best to do good.
[129]  Will the people mentioned in Hebrews 6:4-8 perish?
[130]  Hebrews 6:1 through 8 says, "Therefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be brought on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God, of the teaching of baptisms and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment.
[131]  For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and yet have fallen away, to renew themselves again unto repentance, crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and putting Him to open shame.
[132]  The word "again" in "renew themselves again unto repentance" v. 6 is the same Greek word used in "not laying again a foundation" v. 1 . In Greek, the word "leaving" in verse 1 has the meaning of "slipping" or "falling away." The coordinate conjunction "and" in verses 4 and 5 joins four items together, namely, "once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come." If one has experienced these four items, it is impossible for him to renew his repentance again just because he has fallen once.
[133]  Hebrews 10:26 says, "For when we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins."
[134]  It is true that God sent His Son to die for me, to bear my sins so that I would be saved through believing in His Son.
[135]  What is the meaning of "There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins"?
[136]  Therefore, Hebrews 10 tells us that if there are some who have heard the truth and sin willfully, rejecting the blood of the Son of God, rejecting the Holy Spirit, and despising the Son of God, for them "there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins."
[137]  How many kinds of forgiveness from God are there according to the Bible?
[138]  Now we will explain these five kinds of forgiveness separately.
[139]  First John 2:1 and 2 say, "My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin.
[140]  And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world."
[141]  First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[142]  This concerns God's way of dealing with His children.
[143]  Concerning the forgiveness of the kingdom, Matthew 18:21 through 35 says, "Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?
[144]  Although we cannot be saved through good behavior, we do need good behavior in order to be rewarded.
[145]  A certain saint once said, "I pray that God will cleanse with the Lord's blood even the tears that I shed in sorrow for my sin!
[146]  How many kinds of salvation are mentioned in the Bible?
[147]  We are saved because God loved us, not because we loved God 1 John 4:10 .
[148]  Our love may easily change, but God's love is deeper than the love of a mother Isa 49:15 ; it is eternal Jer 31:3 , to the uttermost John 13:1 , and unchanging.
[149]  This everlasting love of God assures us that His salvation can never be a matter of concern and never be lost.
[150]  We are not saved by ourselves nor by our works but by the grace of God Eph 2:8-9 .
[151]  Furthermore, God has saved us according to His grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages 2 Tim 1:9 .
[152]  "All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" John 6:37 .
[153]  The Lord has promised that He will never cast out those who come to Him.
[154]  At the second coming of the Lord, our body will be redeemed, transformed, and conformed to His glorious body Phil 3:21 .
[155]  We can come before God because God sees us in the same way that He sees Christ.
[156]  "To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours" 1 Cor 1:2 .
[157]  "But according to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also be holy in all your manner of life" 1 Pet 1:15 .
[158]  Thank God that having been freed from sin and separated unto God, we are enslaved to God and should have our fruit unto sanctification.
[159]  Instead, we should offer our members to righteousness and should belong wholly to God so that we can be slaves of God and bear the fruit of sanctification.
