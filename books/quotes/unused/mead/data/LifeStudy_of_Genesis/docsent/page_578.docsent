   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>11 Concerning Asher a Rich Food and Royal Dainties</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Gad comes Asher.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sequence here is certainly under God's inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 20 says, "Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Asher's bread is fat; that is, his food is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we have the victory of Christ and help our brothers gain their portion before we enjoy our own, we have rich food.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This rich food even becomes royal dainties, the royal food.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not food for the common people, but food for kings, for the royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What we enjoy in the victorious life is not only regular food, but also royal dainties.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one can deny that the food in the church life is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In fact it is so rich that it becomes the royal dainties.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are not only a lion family, but also a royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are a kingly family, and our dining is royal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever we feed on in these life-study messages is royal dainties.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>b More Blessed Than the Sons</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and Most Favored among His Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Deuteronomy 33:24 says, "Asher shall be blessed more than the sons; let him be favored among his brethren" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may wonder how Asher could be more blessed than Judah or Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For Asher to be more blessed than the sons means to be more blessed in the riches of food and minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>c Dipping His Foot in Oil</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Deuteronomy 33:24 also says, "Let him dip his foot in oil."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Judah was to wash his garments in wine, but here Asher is to dip his foot in oil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 6:6 speaks of not harming oil and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In times of famine oil and wine become scarce.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Undoubtedly the oil here is olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to both history and geography, there is an abundance of olive trees in this part of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, it is rich in oil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fact that Asher will dip his foot in oil indicates that, as far as food is concerned, he is richer than all the other tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>d Iron and Copper under His Sandals</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Deuteronomy 33:25 says, "Under thy sandals shall be iron and copper" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Iron and copper are for fighting the battle and for building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Oil is food for nourishment, but iron and copper are materials for fighting and for building up the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because Asher is so rich, the most favored in food and minerals, he is more blessed than the other tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has the food for nourishment and the minerals for weapons and building materials.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>e His Rest Being as His Days</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Deuteronomy 33:25 also says, "And as thy days, so shall thy rest be" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Hebrew word rendered "rest" here is not the common word for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This word is very difficult to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It means safety, security, strength, peace, and quietness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It denotes a leisurely life, a life in which there is sufficiency, with no need to worry or rush.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, Asher was to have a leisurely life, a life that was safe and secure, with sufficiency guaranteed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that throughout life he would not lack anything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He would have the rich food for nourishment, the weapons for defense, and the materials for building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead of scarcity, there would be sufficiency, rest, peace, and leisure.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He would constantly enjoy life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Unless you have come into this stage of the spiritual life, you may not understand what I am talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But there is such a stage.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you have not yet arrived at it, I encourage you to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day you will come to such a country.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this realm there is no need to hurry or rush.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here there is safety, security, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here we are short of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have food, weapons, and materials.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you have arrived at this stage, there is no need to worry or care about tomorrow, and there is no anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, there is continual rest in the riches of food and in the strong iron and copper.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At least some of us have come to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the maturity of life.</S>
