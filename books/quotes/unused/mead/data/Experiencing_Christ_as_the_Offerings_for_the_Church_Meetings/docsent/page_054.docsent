   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FATHER S HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 14:2 the Lord Jesus said, In My Father s house are many abodes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What or who is the Father s house?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Father s house is firstly the incarnated Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The incarnated Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God did house Himself in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The incarnation was God s housing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Christ was on this earth, God housed Himself in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That was the Father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, in John 2:19 the Lord Jesus told the Jews, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This meant His physical body would be raised in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In resurrection Christ raised His own body, the destroyed house of God, with the church, His mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The New Testament goes on to tell us in 1 Timothy 3:15 that the church is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must connect this verse with John 14:2 which says, In My Father s house are many abodes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The many abodes of John 14 are the house of God, which is the church of the living God of 1 Timothy 3.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to these verses God is so solid for us to enter into, but there is the need of some bridging instruments, the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So John 1 which speaks of the tabernacling God also speaks of the Lamb of God v. 29 . On the one hand there is the tabernacle which is Christ, and on the other hand there is the Lamb of God indicating Christ as the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE REALITY OF THE FULFILLMENT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we have to consider the reality of the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes, Christ is the tabernacle, and Christ is all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we have to ask: Where is the tabernacle today?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And where are all the offerings today?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the reality these are empty doctrines and vain talk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is the need of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This word, reality, is used very particularly and very specifically in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 1:14 says, And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father , full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The tabernacle in the Old Testament was full of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The glory of God was upon the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then in the New Testament, Christ, the incarnated God, became the tabernacle, and the glory of God was upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And He was full of grace and reality, so the word reality is used in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>WORSHIP IN SPIRIT AND IN REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in chapter four the Samaritan woman talked to the Lord Jesus about worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus told her that an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Father is seeking a certain kind of worship a worship in spirit and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In chapter eight the Lord Jesus spoke of reality again: And you shall know the reality, and the reality shall set you free v. 32 . Reality frees people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus continued to speak of reality in chapter fourteen: And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, Whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This Comforter whom the Lord would send is just the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is reality?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Reality is just the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let me illustrate: suppose I have a book about electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From the first page to the last, it is concerning electricity, and I am teaching this book.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I teach you many things about electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, if we don t have electricity, we don t have the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only electricity itself is the reality of the book and of its teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we only have the book about electricity, but no electricity, it is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no reality until electricity is installed in a building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once the electricity is actually installed, you have the reality of the book and the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the same way the Bible teaches us many wonderful things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It teaches us that Christ is the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But what or who is the reality?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you don t have the Spirit, these are just terms.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The tabernacle is just a term; the offerings are just terms.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Without the Spirit as the reality, these are vain terms.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once electricity is installed into a building, you simply need to be taught where the switches are and what they operate.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That is not a teaching of vanity; that is a teaching of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings, but without Christ becoming the Spirit, these are vain teachings.</S>
