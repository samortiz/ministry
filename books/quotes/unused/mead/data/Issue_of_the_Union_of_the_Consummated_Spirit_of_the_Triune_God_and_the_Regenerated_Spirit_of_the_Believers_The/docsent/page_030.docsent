   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The building up of the Body of Christ is in love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When all the members love one another, the Body of Christ can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>D. The Growth in Christ of the Many God-men</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>as the Members of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is the Building Up of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The growth in Christ of the many God-men as the members of Christ is the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Body of Christ, the growth of the many God-men as the members is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The growth is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The real building is the growth in the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The growth of the Body of Christ is the increase of Christ in the many members, resulting in the Body of Christ building itself up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>E. Such a Building Up of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is Formed by Organic Growth,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not Organized by Human Work</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a building up of the Body of Christ is formed by organic growth, not organized by human work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All those who are not in life, not walking according to the union of the two spirits, are not in the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to see this vision clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Body of Christ is absolutely not built up by using man's natural methods or the organization of human work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The building up of the Body of Christ can be attained only through the co-living and co-walking of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man in the believers in their experience of the co-death and co-resurrection with Christ and their growing up into the Head, Christ, in all things.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to see this vision clearly so that we can build up the Body of Christ organically.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today there are people who argue by saying that a local church is independent; a local church should not interfere with another local church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They say that after an apostle has established the church, he should not interfere with that church anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All such people are short of revelation and vision; they have not seen the truth.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every word of this speaking is taken from Ephesians chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible has sixty-six books, yet there is not one book or one chapter that is so mysterious and organic in speaking about the building up of the Body of Christ as Ephesians chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the points in this outline are pearls and precious stones of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I put these together and compiled them into writing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is what we call "crystallization."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that you can all get into the crystallization of these truths.</S>
