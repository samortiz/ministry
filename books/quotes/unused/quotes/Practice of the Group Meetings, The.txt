In our study over the past five years, the Lord has shown us His ordained way for meeting and serving in the church
There are very many ways to visit people by knocking on their doors, and we are still not satisfied with our present way
An article in a recent newspaper reported that the Mormons have had a great success in knocking on people's doors
The Mormons teach one of the greatest heresies in Christianity, but they have learned the proper way to do things
When they go to visit Korean or Vietnamese homes, they send two Caucasians who can speak Korean or Vietnamese fluently
The Mormon teaching is one of the greatest heresies, yet no one can deny that they have had a great success in the last century
They may be Caucasian, but when a Chinese person gets off an airplane, they greet him in proper Mandarin and ask him if he needs a ride
When we go to middle-class Caucasian families, we may practice to send brothers who do not speak English properly or speak with an accent
If we would instead send three welldressed brothers who speak properly the middleclass families would not refuse to open their doors to them
Some have said that visiting people for the gospel by knocking on their doors does not work, at least not in America
Even the Son of God came into the world to visit people where they were, and He sent the twelve and then the seventy to visit others
We have not yet seen the real issue of the God-ordained way because our way to carry it out is not satisfactory
The old way of Christianity not only annuls the function of the members of the Body of Christ but also makes everyone lazy
In the old way of meeting, we came together in the meeting hall to listen to a brother who was knowledgeable in the Bible
If we are not able to answer the new ones questions in a practical way this indicates that we do not know how to meet in the group meetings
The first thing we need to care for is a practical fellowship among the attendants related to their daily life
The fellowship in the small groups should include such practical matters as the health and circumstances of the saints in the group
All the matters related to the practical life of all the persons meeting in the group should be covered in the fellowship
It would take twenty honest, diligent, knowledgeable, and capable elders to shepherd a church of two hundred saints
The traditional way of meeting in Christianity is also for a number of people to come together with a Bible teacher
According to the natural way of thinking, he will ask the elders to arrange a meeting for this purpose once a week
Rather, in a group meeting an apostle may be present, and there may also be a prophet, an evangelist, or a shepherd and teacher
In our study and experimentation, we have found that the best way to teach is to raise questions in the group meetings
By asking the proper questions and answering the questions of others, we spontaneously teach, instruct, and perfect others
We need to learn not only how to answer the questions of the new ones in the group meetings, but also how to ask questions
If we have a burden to teach a certain item, we should not teach it directly but turn this burden into a question
Regardless of how much one knows and how good his speaking may be, one person's speaking can never compare with many answers
Some churches have been established for nearly sixteen years, but because we did not practice the proper way, they have not gained much
Among us there are some older saints who love the Lord and the church but do not have the habit of attending the group meetings
They have the habit only of coming to the Lord's table meeting, the ministry meeting, and sometimes the prayer meeting
To charge, encourage, and exhort them to come to the group meetings will not work since they do not have such a habit
These older saints with the traditional ways will eventually be in the same group meetings as the newly baptized ones
We must let the new ones know that we do not care as much for the big meetings as we care for the group meetings
At the same time we should have a thorough fellowship with the older saints in the group, either in our home or in their home
We can tell them that they should forget about the old way of meeting and that they need to pick up the new way
If some saints would raise up group meetings in the new way, after a few months many others will follow them to do the same
We need to go along with the need of the new ones, but in going along with their need, we must bring them into the new way
We need to learn the best way to have the group meetings, and we need to spend time to labor according to what we have learned
Verse 25 tells us not to forsake the meetings-not the meetings in a general sense but in the sense of 'the assembling of ourselves together'
Now as Christians they needed to have a Christian meeting, which they should have considered as 'their' meeting
As Christians we should take care of the Christian meeting, which these verses call 'the assembling of ourselves together'
The number who attend the group meetings should be higher than the number who attend the other kinds of meetings
Most brothers and sisters attend the Lord's Day morning meetings because most of them came from a traditional background
After the Lord's ascension, they returned to Jerusalem and prayed in one accord for ten days to be clothed with power from on high
On the day of Pentecost they received the outpouring of the Spirit, and they began to preach and to propagate Christ
These verses tell us that the Christians met in their homes, and the number of home meetings was according to the number of homes
In the Gospels, when the Lord Jesus fed the five thousand, He told the disciples to make the people sit down in groups
On the day of Pentecost, when three thousand people were to be baptized, the disciples probably divided them into groups
Acts 5:42 says that in the homes 'they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ'
According to the principle in the New Testament , it is doubtful that only one person in each group taught and all the others listened
It is of the flesh to do something with the purpose of being different from religion, but we do not need to be the same every time
In a recent conference meeting there were seventeen hundred attendants, but the meeting still kept a fixed sequence
When the saints began coming together, no one declared the banners, read the Scripture references, or called a hymn
They knew how to meet in the Jewish way, but on that day they saw something that caused them to be beside themselves
When we pray we should also make a thorough confession of all our failures defects shortcomings wrongdoings mistakes and transgressions
If we are not able to have this kind of meeting with one another, then we will not be able to do it with the new ones
Judas, on the other hand, had a very clear, sober mind, a mind that considered how much money he could gain by betraying the Lord
He said, 'I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house'
Paul exhorted and admonished the believers, both publicly in the big meetings and privately from house to house
He did not shrink from telling them of all the things they needed to live their daily life according to the will of God
Raising up the new believers in the way Paul did cannot be accomplished merely by the big meetings of the church
Many of us, however, came from the background of traditional Christianity, and it is not easy to change our way
Without this desperation we will still have group meetings with spiritually old saints in the old way with the old concept
Our group meetings of the past were better than nothing, but we must realize that they might not have been carried out in the coached way
We, however, were not born nineteen centuries ago, and we did not receive the revelation directly from the Lord as Paul did
During the past five years, we spent much time to reconsider all the practices of Christianity over the last twenty years
We studied and restudied the Bible and we eventually discovered from Pauls writings the truth of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel
We compared this truth to the practices of gospel preaching in the Catholic Church, the state churches, and the denominations
Now we have learned that the top way, God's ordained, biblical way, is the way we are passing on in these messages
The God-ordained way to meet and to serve is recorded in the Bible, and every word spoken by the Lord will be fulfilled
If we mean business with the Lord, we must make a decision to have a radical change in our understanding concerning the Lord's way
The problem among us is that we have become old and stale, and we have not adopted the new way with desperation
If we send brothers from ethnic minorities to visit a middle-class Caucasian family, they may not be properly received
On the other hand, if four middle-aged Caucasian brothers and sisters visit the same family, they will not be rejected
Sometimes we may help them in other ways, such as inviting them to a meeting or simply speaking to them on the street
The second step in carrying out the God-ordained way is to feed the new ones by meeting with them in their homes
These new beginners may be those who have been saved and baptized among us, or they may be other new believers whom we have met
After feeding the new ones for a short time, we should bring them together to form a group meeting, not just for feeding but for perfecting
These four steps for carrying out the God-ordained way to meet and to serve should not merely be something we learn
Someone may ask about a brother's job situation, and the group may again pray and seek the Lord's leading in caring for him and his family
He may offer a prayer, and his prayer will change the atmosphere of the meeting and bring it into another stage
The teaching in the group meetings should be carried out not by a particular person but by all the attendants in that meeting
Everyone has a small portion, and when everyone presents what he has, all the portions are added together to make a good teaching
If the saints attend this kind of group meeting week after week for two or three years, they will be perfected
If we would practice having group meetings for several months, we will know how to meet, and we will receive the benefit
We may not know how to have group meetings in life, in spirit, and according to everyone's current situation and need
In the old way of meeting, we could meet for some years and still not know the other attendants in the meeting
In a church with several hundred newly baptized believers, it would be impossible to have enough elders to care for them all
If such a church meets in the old way, the number of new ones will be impressive, but there will be little content of reality
If this church meets in a proper way, the several hundred members will be formed into groups of eight to fifteen persons
The members of the group will come to know one another very well, and the entire church will be under a daily, mutual care
According to the old way, the elders divide the church into several groups and appoint a leader for each group
We must live a life that is released, living, and refreshing, and we need to keep a constant fellowship with the Lord all day long
A released, living, and refreshing Christian lives in the spirit, and when he uses his spirit, the Holy Spirit comes out
It is easy for such persons to help people be saved and, after they are saved, to spend time with them to feed them
We have had much speaking and teaching concerning the new way, and we have discovered many crucial points related to it
The first step in the Lord's new way is to contact people to bring them the gospel of the kingdom, which is the gospel of Christ
In order to contact people for the gospel, we should not merely stay home to pray for them and invite them to come to us
Some people may not be willing to make an appointment, but due to the telephone calls, they may come to the Lord's Day morning meeting
One church has begun to keep a guest book to record many details concerning each new one who comes to the meetings
If a business receives only three replies for every one hundred brochures they mail out, they will recover their expenses
According to our study of church history, it is hard to find a church that has had even a thirty percent annual increase
To have children physically is a joy, but in the eyes of God spiritual children are much more precious than physical children
Whether or not the enjoyment of Christ is fresh to us depends on fruit bearing as the result, the issue, of our enjoyment of Christ
It is impossible for a branch to abide in the vine and enjoy all the riches and life juice from the root of the vine without bearing fruit
In John 15:16 the Lord said, 'I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain'
To be a Christian we need to grow, but we may have been in the Lord and in the church for many years without the proper growth in life
We would be bothered if our child had no growth after several years, Likewise, we all have to be bothered about our lack of growth in life
The way some dear saints speak and consider the things concerning the church indicates that they are not only childish but also babyish
The reason we may lack the growth in life but still be content is that we do not care for fruit bearing and taking care of the young ones
Once we rise up to bear fruit and care for spiritual children, we will discover that we need the growth in life
Worldly leisure leads us into sin, but using our leisure time for spiritual matters leads us into fellowship with the Lord
The church is the Body of Christ, and just as every part of our body functions, all the members of the Body of Christ function
According to the parable in Matthew 25:14-30, the Lord has delivered His talents to us, and one day He will come and settle accounts with us
In this parable, the one with five talents and the one with two talents gave an account of what they had done, and they received a reward
We should not take the easy, natural way to meet, in which several people come together, sing a hymn, pray, and testify in a natural way
If we do not know how to teach and receive teaching, we cannot attain to the goal of the group meeting, and our meetings will be too low
In the practice of the new way, to teach is not merely to open the Bible or a particular book to point out certain truths
For this reason we have published many books, including one which tells us where the Bible came from and how it was composed
In this regard, we hope that none of the saints in the Lord's recovery will take the way of traditional Christianity
In order to attend the group meetings and take care of the younger ones, we have to endeavor to become qualified, perfected, and equipped
The older saints among us can at least pray and care for the older ones among their relatives, neighbors, and friends
Our care for others should not be in the way of traditional Christianity, in which a meeting is established with a gifted one as the speaker
If our care for others is like this, we will not have a good report when we go to the Lord to give an account to Him
If we have no problems or needs of our own but know of the needs of others, we may fellowship something about their up-to-date situation
Considering one another, inciting one another, and exhorting one another cannot be accomplished in the big meetings
These items in the first section of the group meeting cannot fulfill the purpose of the group meeting or reach its goal
A sister can say, 'Brothers and sisters, we all need to be sanctified from the world unto God by the holy word'
Another sister may ask what sanctification is, and a brother can give a defining word on the meaning of sanctification
A fourth may say, 'Formerly, we were mixed with the world, but sanctification separates us from that situation unto God
Even if we have a burden to teach and exhort others concerning a particular matter, we should not release our burden directly
Once we ask a question, all the attendants in the meeting will have the obligation to say something, and they will all become teachers
In order to take care of a group meeting and answer the questions asked by the new ones, we need to learn a great deal
Even if one has been a Christian for only one week, he will have had some experience and will have something to say
On the other hand, it is not easy to be effective in our carrying out of the purpose and goal of the group meetings
We also need to use our time wisely to study other positive matters, such as humanity, history, and foreign languages
If we are not such capable persons, the Lord will not have the way to return, because He will not be able to build up His organic Body
We need the foundation of life, the Spirit, the apostles' teaching, the subjective experience of the cross, and resurrection
If we do not live a life under the cross and in the resurrection of Christ, whatever we can do and whatever we would do will mean nothing
Every time we come together to have a group meeting, we must warm each other up and become intimately acquainted again
They will be open, and there will be no uneasy feeling and no frustration to the mutual speaking and mutual understanding
In asking questions in the group meetings, we need to consider whether the subject of our questions is profitable to all the saints
When a group meeting becomes prevailing, everyone in it will be free, but this may open the door for certain peculiar things to come in
The most valuable and difficult aspect of the group meetings is the teaching through the raising and answering of questions
When Brother Nee was a student, he determined that he would read through the New Testament every week for a year
He later said that that year of reading the New Testament was the most profitable time in his life in knowing the Bible
It is difficult to see these matters in a book without reading it a number of times and studying it thoroughly
At least we can finish the New Testament once a year and read through the Old Testament every two or three years
In order to read through the Bible in this way, we need to read it quickly, taking only a few minutes to read each chapter
In this kind of quick reading, we do not need to ponder, meditate, or dwell on the verses as we do in morning watch
Reading through the Word of God in this way does not mean that we should read without help from reference books
Of relying on our own consideration in deciding on the correct denotation of the word, we should consult the proper reference books
Brother Nee took the lead to read many of these books and laid a good foundation for us in knowing the best ones
During the teaching in a group meeting, someone may ask an important question, such as, 'What is the most crucial point in the Bible'?
In answering a question concerning head covering, we should not speak merely about the covering on a sister's head
For this we need not only the proper knowledge but also the experience and the excelling way to present what we have
In order to emphasize the importance of the preaching of the gospel, the New Testament uses different figures of speech in referring to it
In Luke 14:21-23, which contains several crucial points regarding the gospel, the Lord used the figure of an invitation to a feast
The lord said to the slave, Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled'
The front door of people's houses is usually accessible from the streets, whereas the back door often is approached from the lanes
Everyone who contends exercises selfcontrol in all things those therefore that they may receive a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible
In these verses Paul used the figure of contending in the Olympics to describe the importance of gospel preaching
We also must stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together, struggling like Olympic athletes, in the faith of the gospel
The center of the gospel is Christ in us as the hope of glory, but we must bring this news to people and make it known to them
The phrase in all wisdom indicates that we must exhaust our wisdom that we may present every man, one by one, full-grown in Christ
In the past several years many messages have been given regarding the new way, which is actually the God-ordained way to meet and to serve
At first there was a certain amount of opposition and criticism against the new way, but now there is not much opposition
Certain denominations require that a new member learn a number of doctrines and pass an examination before he can be baptized
All that may be required of such a believer is that he come to the Sunday morning service, leave an offering, and behave properly
They may go to their pastor for help, but many pastors may only quench their seeking, because the pastors themselves have no way to go on
Throughout the past nineteen centuries, seeking ones have been raised up to discover new truths from the Bible
We have found that the preachers of the gospel should be laboring, energizing, ministering priests of the New Testament
Their main offerings were the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
In the New Testament the main offering is saved sinners, who will be transformed to be the members of Christ's Body
Feeding the new ones is the practice of feeding the lambs and the practice of a nursing mother feeding her babes
Paul said that the apostles were like nursing mothers to the new believers, cherishing and nourishing them that they might grow
If we do not have at least two or three under our caring hand, then we must 'go fishing' to gain some new ones
We must perfect them and build them up to speak the word of Christ, to speak Christ, and speak forth Christ to others, that is, to prophesy
All the elders should take the lead to get new ones saved and to always have two or three new ones under their caring hand
The Lord is for bringing sinners to be saved, regenerated, sanctified, and transformed to be His living members
The most pleasant thing to the Lord is that those who love Him and seek Him would have two or three new ones under their care
If a son has been married for three years but does not have a child, his parents may not be happy to visit him
If there are two or three grandchildren in a home, the grandparents will want to stay all day to play with them
We may visit people by knocking on their doors, or we may call them on the telephone or ask the saints to recommend their relatives to us
We will have to take care of them, to cherish and nourish them, not just for a few days but for a considerable period of time
On the Lord's Day we should meet for about two hours in the morning to have the Lord's table and to speak the Lord's word to one another
By praying only once in the prayer meeting, we may receive more edification than by attending another kind of meeting
One evening a week we should attend a group meeting for fellowship, for our perfecting, and for the perfecting of others
Even if we use the entire Saturday for sundry affairs, we will still have five evenings and one afternoon free
It would be even better if we would go out twice a week, one afternoon and one evening, or two evenings a week
