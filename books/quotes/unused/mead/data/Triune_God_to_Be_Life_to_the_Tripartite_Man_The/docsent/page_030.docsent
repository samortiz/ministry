   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX TO BE SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE DIVINE LIFE OF CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10; 8:2, 6b, 4; 12:2a; 6:19b, 22b; 12:2b; Col 3:4; Rom 12:1, 3-5; 8:29b, 6, 11, 30c; Phil 3:21; Rom 8:23; 5:17; 16:20 THE WAY OF LIFE IN THE BOOK OF ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will see the matter of the Triune God being life to the tripartite man as shown in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other words, we will see the book of Romans in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The verses listed at the beginning of this message are concerning the divine life in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need a complete view of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The title of this message is "To Be Saved in the Divine Life of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we come to this subject, we need to keep in mind the preceding messages, especially message five which was entitled "The Triune God Being Processed to Be the Life-giving Spirit and the Tripartite Man Being Created with a Spirit to Be the Receiver and Container of the Divine Life."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this and other messages, we have seen how the thought of God being man's life runs throughout the divine revelation, from Genesis to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have also seen that the Triune God has been processed to be the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we have seen how the tripartite man has been created with a spirit Gen 2:7; Prov 20:27 to be the receiver and container of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God was processed to be a Spirit, and we were created with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When these two spirits come together, we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the foregoing messages, we have seen many things in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But with this message, we will begin to study these things in more detail, point by point.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first point of our more detailed study is the Triune God being life to us as revealed in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most Bible expositors do not touch the matter of life in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Most of them mainly touch the matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because of the importance of Romans 1:17 which says, "For the righteousness of God is revealed in it the gospel out of faith to faith: as it is written, But the just shall have life and live by faith" lit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>. Most of the expositors only cover the first part of this verse, but neglect the end of it which deals with having life and living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are three crucial points in Romans 1:17: righteousness, faith, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The righteousness of God is unveiled out of faith to faith in order that the righteous or just can have life and live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to my study I have found that other Christian writers usually stress the matters of righteousness and faith in Romans, but not the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason for this is that they, as indicated by their theology, have not yet arrived at the matter of life.</S>
