   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE CHURCH, GOD S FARM AND GOD S BUILDING 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:5-17 TWO ASPECTS OF PLANTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 3:6 and 7 Paul speaks of planting and watering: I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow; so that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One Who makes to grow, God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To plant is to minister life and impart life to someone who is spiritually dead so that this person may become living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When life is imparted to a person dead in sins, he becomes a living plant.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because Paul imparted life to the Corinthians, he was their father in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 4:15 he says, For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before Paul came to Corinth, the Corinthians were not plants.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the contrary, they were dead sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when Paul visited them, he imparted life to them, and they became living plants.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the first aspect of planting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The second aspect of planting is to bring the living plants into contact with the proper soil and to place them in the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be sure, the right soil in which the plants may grow is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, we need to learn how to impart Christ into sinners through the preaching of the gospel in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Christ is imparted into others, they become living plants.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the other hand, we need to put these plants into the proper soil, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These two things together constitute the planting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A MATTER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Planting, watering, and making to grow are all related to the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates clearly that the believers are God s farm to grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The ministers of Christ can plant and water.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is the only One who can make to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Corinthian believers overestimated the planter and the waterer, but neglected the One who makes to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, they did not grow in Christ as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Corinthian believers, under the influence of Greek philosophical wisdom, paid too much attention to knowledge and neglected life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this chapter Paul s aim is to turn their attention from knowledge to life, pointing out to them that he is a feeder and a planter, Apollos is a waterer, and God is the Giver of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 4:15 he even tells them that he is their spiritual father, who begot them in Christ through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From the view of life, the divine view, they are God s farm to grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is totally a matter of life, a matter which is utterly missed by believers who are dominated by their soulish, natural life under the influence of their natural wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 7 Paul says, So that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One Who makes to grow, God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As far as the growth in life is concerned, all the ministers of Christ, whether a planter or a waterer, are nothing, and God is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must turn our eyes from them to God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This delivers us from the divisiveness which results from appreciating one minister of Christ above another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>PLANTING, WATERING, AND GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the church life we must learn not only how to plant, but also how to water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, watering others is very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose a saint comes to you with a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not try to solve this person s problem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, we are not able to solve others problems.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you not have many problems of your own which are not yet solved?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since you have not solved your own problems, how do you expect to help others with their problems?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, in watering the saints, we should forget about trying to solve their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to my experience, the best way to water others is to pray-read a few verses with them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, a brother may present a problem concerning his job or family life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead of touching the problem, pray-read the Word with him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you do this, both of you will be watered.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You will know that the one who came to you has been watered by the fact that you yourself have been watered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Your consciousness of having been watered proves that you have watered him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In our contact with others a great deal of time is wasted by vain talk.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Problems cannot be solved by talking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if you are able to solve someone s problem, this will not supply him with life or water him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead, it will kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I repeat, we should not try to solve the problems of others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we try to solve problems, the more problems there will be, and the more others will be killed by our efforts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead of becoming involved with problems, we should be simple in our contact with those who come to us for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God is our Father, and eventually He will take care of all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The crucial matter is the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have pointed out that by pray-reading with another saint, we can water him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes it is sufficient simply to pray with that one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By praying the other person is brought to the Lord, and we are brought into the Lord in a deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a result, both parties are watered.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a very practical way of watering the saints in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In verses 6 and 7 Paul speaks not only of planting and watering, but also of growing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul emphasizes the fact that it is God alone who makes to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The growth on God s farm produces the materials for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since it is God who makes to grow, we must leave the matter of growth to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our responsibility is to plant and water, not to help others grow.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we try to help others grow, we overstep our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is beyond our capacity to cause the saints to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>None of us can produce growth in other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Not even Paul was able to make the saints grow.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He was very clear that we can plant and water, but only God gives the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>While we are planting and watering, we need to have the assurance with faith that God will make to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to believe that God is here and that He will cause whatever we plant and water to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we have this assurance, we shall not try to help others grow.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we try to help other plants grow, we may damage them and pluck them up.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I once read of a little boy who was bothered by the fact that the grass near his house was not growing very well.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Wanting to help the grass grow, he plucked up many blades of grass.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As a result, instead of growing, the grass died.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What this little boy did to the grass illustrates what some saints are doing in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The elders in some churches are not planting and watering; instead, in their efforts to help the saints to grow, they are plucking them up.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But the more the elders help in this way, the less the plants grow.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is important for us to have the full assurance that when we plant and water, God will make to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Thus, after planting and watering, we should be at rest and not try to help others grow.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Growth is not of us; it is altogether of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Through the church life and our watering, God will supply the plants and enable them to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As long as the saints remain in the church life and are watered, God will make them grow.</S>
