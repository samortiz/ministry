   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE MEANING OF PRAYER MATCHING PRAYER AND THE READING OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 119:147-148 says, "I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 15:7 says, "If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before we speak concerning the meaning of prayer, let us look at how prayer and reading the Word match one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The two passages above clearly show us that these two matters prayer and reading the Word go hand in hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Psalm 119 there is a seeker of God who lives before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He matches his seeking for the Word of God with his calling, that is, his prayer, before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 15, speaking of the promise of answers to prayers, the Lord shows us from another aspect how we should match our prayer with the reading of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's Word shows us that a prayer will be answered on the basis of two things: one is that we abide in Him, and the other is that His words must also abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He promises that if these two basic conditions are present, we may ask whatever we will and it shall come to pass to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, here it speaks of matching prayer with the reading of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brothers and sisters, to a normal Christian, these two things reading the Word and praying are the two aspects of his living; both are indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can see that in God's ordination almost everything in the universe is two-sided.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, above and below, left and right, yes and no, day and night, male and female all are two-sided, or you may say they are counterparts for full and proper function.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our human body gives us many examples of this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For instance, I have two legs which make it very convenient for me to either stand or walk.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose I had only one leg.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then I would not be able to stand well, and I would have even more trouble walking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only so, but our hands, ears, eyes, and nostrils are also in pairs and symmetrically arranged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The practical living of a Christian before the Lord also has two sides: one side is the reading of the Word, and the other side is prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we walk, we must use both feet simultaneously in order to maintain our balance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not walk twenty steps with our right foot and only two steps with our left foot.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a Christian living before God, we also need to read the Word and pray simultaneously, thus keeping the balance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Unfortunately, however, once God's ordained laws get into our hands we often make them one-sided.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God ordains that a Christian should give equal importance to both reading the Word and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, some brothers and sisters enjoy only reading the Scriptures, but not praying.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they read the Bible, they may bury their head in it from morning to evening; the more they read it, the better it tastes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every page of their Bible has been drawn with many lines some heavy, some light, some red, and some blue; the whole book is nearly filled with lines.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some have marked two or three copies of the Bible, though they have been saved for only four years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But strangely, they pray very little, and sometimes even when they are moved by the Holy Spirit, they still will not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The enjoyment is unlimited when they read the Word, but when they pray it is like taking bitter medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, there are some who just enjoy praying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The minute they kneel down they are moved to tears, and may sing spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They feel so marvelous and energetic when they pray.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if you want them to read the Bible, they immediately doze off.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They would rather pray daily than read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You see, again, this is one-sided.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers and sisters, if someone reads the Bible more than he prays he will often fall into letters and regulations which bring a dead, dry spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But one who leans to the other side and prays more than he reads the Bible will become spiritually unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we want to maintain a normal Christian life, we must give equal attention to both reading the Word and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Just as we use both feet equally when we walk, we should always both read and pray, pray and read.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever we pray we must touch the Word of God, and whenever we read the Scriptures we must match it with prayer.</S>
