   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Should we have a specific time to come to the Lord to confess?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We do not go to the Lord with a certain purpose; we go because we love Him and want to be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes our grandchildren living nearby stop in to see us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If they behave well, we have learned they are after something.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As soon as they get the cookie or piece of gum they have come for, they take off.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such behavior is like our coming to the Lord with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He wants us to come out of love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It would please us so much if our grandchildren came to visit us just because they loved us, not for any other purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So it is with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Early in the morning He would have us contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our need and out of love for Him, we go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then, in His presence, because He is light, we see our faults, spontaneously make confession, and are cleansed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To go to the Lord with the purpose of confessing, on the other hand, may result in several minutes of frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some of us have seen the need for physical exercise and have started jogging, or playing tennis, volleyball, or softball.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As you have said, the trend of this age is with sports.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Can you help us have the proper attitude toward taking care of our body and yet, on the other hand, be preserved from the world of sports?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this crooked, perverse generation, sports and entertainment lead many people into sin and are, in fact, their means of fulfilling their lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to follow the principle of avoiding the appearance of evil 1 Thes 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your question indicates that you love the Lord and are seeking after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As Christians we are not under the law, but under the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, when you would go out to participate in some sport, first ask Him, "Lord, will You go with me?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord may say, "I don't like that.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I won't go there with you."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If that is the case, how are you going to get the needful exercise for your body?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may think that young people will not exercise if they cannot be in games.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It all depends on your love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a young man I played on the school team.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day, after I was saved, the ball came to me, but I could not kick it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one outwardly restrained me, but I could not exercise my foot to kick the ball.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That was the end of my participation in that sport.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nonetheless, over the years I have surely gotten plenty of exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even now I spend an hour or so a day in exercise, walking, sweeping the yard, watering the plants, and cleaning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without exercise I cannot sleep well; I need to be exhausted of my preoccupations through exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you love the Lord, He will lead you as to the kind of exercise you should have.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would like to give you some examples of death and resurrection in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we said in the previous message, the spices of the compound ointment Exo 30:23-25 are the constituents of the Word as well as of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is the difference between the teachings in the Bible and the ethical teachings of Confucius?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both contain corrections and adjustments, but in the Bible those corrections and adjustments contain a killing element.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both this killing factor and the element of resurrection are the main constituents of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us illustrate how this killing factor works.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose you come home from work tired out, and as soon as you step into the house, something provokes you to be annoyed with your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You do not say anything because you have made a commitment to take a nap before you do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After your short nap you read the Word for thirty minutes or so.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When that is over, your annoyance will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even if you try to stay annoyed, you will fail!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What has happened?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whatever you read in the Word has killed your annoyance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may even find yourself going to your wife to apologize for not greeting her when you got home.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The killing has brought in resurrection; that is why you now feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The holy Word includes the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It both kills you and supplies you with the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The resulting sense of joy, of the Lord, of the Spirit, of strength, and of nourishment, is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This illustration shows how the two constituents operate in us when we are faithful to get into the Word.</S>
