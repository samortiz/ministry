         <h2 class="head2">The Problem of Our Emotion</h2>
<p>Now we come to the emotions. In addition to the limitations related to our heart and our mind, we also experience limitations related to our emotion. Our emotion is different from our mind. Emotion refers to what we usually regard as our mood. When we are not in a good mood, it is difficult to be inspired when we read the Bible. Hence, we must learn to control and adjust our emotion, our mood. It is not possible to list all the problems related to our emotion. We can only say in a simple way that we need to keep our mood in a stable condition. No matter what happens to us, whether it is something joyful or something sorrowful, whether it is of great benefit to us or of no benefit to us, we need to keep our emotions stable. Furthermore, we need to learn to always set our emotion on God. This means that we must <em>love God.</em> When we set our emotion on God, no matter what happens to us, our emotion will be fixed on God. In everything we must learn to be calm, always maintaining composure.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Problem of Our Will</h2>
<p>Finally, we must consider the problem of our will. We need to ask ourselves whether we are resolved, determined to obey the Lord&rsquo;s commands. We should not make resolutions according to the worldly understanding. The worldly way of making a resolution is useless. In relation to the will, we must be firm and determined in our desire to obey the Lord. We love God, and we obey Him, not because we have made up our mind to do so but because we are firm and determined in our will. Furthermore, we would not depend on ourselves. Depending on ourselves to make a resolution will cause us to fail and will be a distraction to us. Although we have a determined will, we should never depend on ourselves.</p>
<p>We must depend fully on the Lord. The consequence of depending on our resolution, our will, is failure. If a brother relies on his will, his determination, he will be distracted when he reads the Bible, because he will become proud. Hence, our determination, our will, must not come from ourselves. Instead of depending on ourselves, we must depend on God in our resolution to love and obey Him.</p>
<p>We can set our will to depend on the Lord because we know that when He commands us to do something, He will accomplish it by coming to us and doing it in us. He comes to us to fulfill what He wants us to do. For this reason, we should not have any worries or fears. We have the faith to declare, &ldquo;Since God commands, He will accomplish it for me.&rdquo; Therefore, we must be resolute and determined in our will to stand with the Lord, just as Caleb and Joshua fully followed God (Num. 14:6-9, 24; Deut. 1:36; Josh. 14:14). Caleb fully followed God because he knew that God wanted the children of Israel to enter into the good land. He also knew that no matter how strong their enemies were, God would fight for them. Since God wanted them to enter the good land, He would accomplish everything for them. Caleb seemed to say, &ldquo;If we know that we are weak, God knows that we are weak. If we know that the seven Canaanite tribes are strong, God also knows that they are strong. Since God knows these things, He would not ask us to enter the land of Canaan unless He intends to fight on our behalf and destroy our enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are three things we must remember concerning having a resolute will: not depending on ourselves, depending only on God, and knowing that He will fulfill what He requires of us. His supply always meets His requirement. We must have this realization so that our resolution is of the spirit.</p>
<p>Another matter related to the resolution of our will is that we must say, &ldquo;Lord, since You want me to do this and You have commanded me to do it, I am willing to obey You even if I must lose everything, including my life.&rdquo; Our resolution must be so strong that we are willing to die in order to obey (Rev. 12:11). As long as we have received the Lord&rsquo;s words, we must be willing to die in order to obey. In other words, no sacrifice is too great, nor is there a price that is too high. Such a resolution means that we do not depend on ourselves but on God. Furthermore, we know that whatever God has said, He will fulfill. We are willing to obey Him even if we must pay a great price, such as death. Such a resolution of the will is a spiritual resolution.</p>
<p>I hope that the serving saints will deal with their heart, their mind, their emotion, and their will. On the one hand, we should use these faculties. On the other hand, we must learn to not come to the Bible only with our mind. Instead, we should contact the Spirit with our spirit. This is the way for us to see the fruit of our learning. Initially, it may not be easy. We might feel like a clumsy child who is learning to ride a bicycle. However, after we practice a few times, we will realize that this is the most efficient way to read the Bible. We must pray earnestly and follow the spirit. If we do not learn to follow the spirit, we will not learn to read the Bible properly.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
