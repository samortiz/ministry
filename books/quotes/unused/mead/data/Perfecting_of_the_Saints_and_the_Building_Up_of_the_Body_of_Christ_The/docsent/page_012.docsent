   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Growing into the Head, Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To hold to truth is for the purpose of growing into the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to our experience, the growth here is not our growth, but it is the growth of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is like the words of John the Baptist: He must increase, but I must decrease John 3:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before we believed in Jesus, it was we who were growing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After we believed in the Lord and began to love Him, we began to decrease, and Christ began to increase within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the end we will be like Paul who said that it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, when Christ grows within us, we grow in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, our growth is just His growth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result, we decrease, and He comes in to gradually replace us, and we grow into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In All Things Everything Big or Small</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>in Our Daily Life and in Our Work</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In all things means in everything big or small in our daily life and in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether they are big things, small things, spiritual things, or things in our daily life, we have to allow the Lord to grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must decrease, and He must grow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once He grows and we decrease, we will grow into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Growing into the Head through Acknowledging</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>the Authority of the Headship of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The meaning of growing into the Head, Christ, is acknowledging the authority of the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to acknowledge Him as Lord and Head.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has the authority over us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In all things big or small we have to allow Him to be the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This lesson is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In our eating out in restaurants and in our shopping, seldom do we allow Him to be the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since we lack the practice in our daily life, it is not a surprise that when we come to the meeting we find it difficult to prophesy for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The key to prophesying is to allow Jesus to be the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In your daily life you have to allow Jesus to be your Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only then will you have the experience, and only then will you have something to say in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is not only the Head of us individually; He is also the Head of the church and the Head of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should acknowledge the authority of His headship in our Christian life, in the church life, and in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By this we will grow into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Allowing Christ to Increase and Grow</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>in All the Inward Parts of the Members</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we grow into the Head, Christ, we are allowing Christ to increase and grow in all the inward parts of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today our common problem is that we reserve a big part within us for ourselves and give the Lord only a little place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, it is impossible for Him to increase and grow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When He cannot grow, we cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are many Christians on earth today; but there are few who would allow the Lord to grow within them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must allow the Lord to have the proper place in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must allow Him to increase, grow, and occupy our whole being, part by part.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way, when you grow in the Lord and I grow in the Lord, the sum total will be the growth of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, when Christ grows in you and me, the Body of Christ will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the growth of the Body of Christ is the growth of Christ in His members.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The purpose of our practicing the new way is for the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The meaning of the perfecting of the saints is to allow Christ to have the proper place in us and to increase in us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you allow Christ to grow in you, your gift will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result, Christ will not only be your life and living, but will be your gift as well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In other words, Christ will be everything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is the same with our physical life as the body grows, so does the function.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As such we must allow Christ to grow in us so that we can be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This cannot be achieved by the meetings where one speaks and the rest listen.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The way to be perfected is through the practice of the new way which is according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every point of this new way makes man decrease and supplies man with Christ, that Christ would grow in man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more you decrease, the more Christ will increase and the more you will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, the perfecting and the growth in Ephesians chapter four refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To be perfected is to grow in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order to perfect others, we must first have the experience ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must first learn the lessons and know God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then we can help others to see God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not a matter of improving and cultivating ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is a matter of denying our self and knowing the crucified and resurrected Lord as the Spirit who abides in us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should live with Him, move with Him, and allow Him to be the Lord in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This shows us that, on the one hand, the cross has terminated our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the other hand, it shows us that Christ is the Spirit of life who is now our life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The cross decreases us, and the resurrecting Spirit supplies Christ into us that we would be equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the church meetings, all the prophesying should be based on this and should have this as the focus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This kind of word should be spoken frequently in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more we speak this kind of word, the more perfecting there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have to speak until all the brothers and sisters are affected in their daily lives by this kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In this way they will receive the genuine perfecting.</S>
