   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONLY ONE COMMANDMENT FOR BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second commandment is for the believers: live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You may not consider that this is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I realized many years ago that it was a sin not to live Christ, but my sense was not very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was last year that this conviction came upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day, while I was away for a few days of rest, I was waiting before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He seemed to say, "So often you confess your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was true.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever an evil thought came to me, or I had a wrong attitude, or I said something wrong, I would confess.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was as routine for me to do this as for me to wash my hands.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Let me ask you," the Lord said further, "have you ever confessed to me the one sin, that you have not lived Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I said, "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not many times have I confessed this sin."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>INFREQUENTLY LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From that day on, I discovered that there is no end to confessing this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How much I lacked living by Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a twenty-four hour day, how much of the time was I living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Taking out eight hours for sleep, I figured that perhaps not more than two hours a day did I live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The remaining fourteen hours I was not doing wrong, but neither was I living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How did I live Christ in those two hours?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was mainly when I was in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the beginning I would not be living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I would be in my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But by praying I would come into my spirit and live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more I prayed, the more I would live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Afterwards I might be talking with my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I would be in spirit, but after we talked for maybe five minutes, she would ask me a question.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would reply not unpleasantly, but that question caused me to be in my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the time I was answering it, I was not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was not blaming her or even feeling angry, but I was not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the day went on, I would sense that I was off.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Though I had not done anything wrong, I had not lived Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I confessed, "Lord, I have not lived You.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have not been in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have been living myself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>O Lord, forgive this sin of mine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am untrustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do keep reminding me that I am one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not want to have anything outside the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I would be restored and again be living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But a telephone call might come, and again I might be drawn out of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even without a telephone call, I might simply drift away and find I was not living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There may be nothing wrong with the way you are living, but you may still be living apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may be living your morality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You may be living your own reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may be living the doctrines in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A couple may not argue, but their love may still not be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this they do not condemn themselves; in their eyes there is nothing sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A brother may feel that what he is doing is quite all right; another brother even told him he was right.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He goes ahead doing it according to his reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These are just examples to show you how little you live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I doubt that even the best of you live Christ more than five percent of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The rest of the time you may not have been arguing, but neither were you living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>TWO TREES</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God offered Himself to man as the tree of life, but man was deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He chose to eat of another tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everything that is not God belongs to that other tree.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not just evil which pertains to that tree; it is also the good.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Your doctrine belongs to that tree; so do your reasoning, your humility, your pride, and your morality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Both stealing and giving away all your money have their source in this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You may argue with your wife, or you may love her so much that you never argue with her; both are from the same tree.</S>
