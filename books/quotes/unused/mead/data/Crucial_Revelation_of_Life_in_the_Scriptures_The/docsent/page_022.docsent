   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All of us need to be measured by the man of brass.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus as the measuring One, the testing One, the possessing One, needs to come in to measure us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must allow Him to judge us, to test us, in order to possess us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may say that you have consecrated everything on the altar, but the Lord wants to measure us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He desires to test and examine us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After His measuring, the waters increase.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The man of brass again measured a thousand cubits, and the waters came to the knees v. 4 . The more you are measured, tested, judged, and examined, the more you are possessed by the Lord and the deeper the flow becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The third time of measuring by the man of brass in Ezekiel 47 brings the level of water to the loins v. 4 , a much deeper flow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may be in the church and in the flow, but how much have you been tested by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How much have you been judged by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How much have you allowed the Lord to take possession of you?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord examines us by measuring us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord is going to test us, to possess us, and to examine us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He desires to measure everything concerning us, even the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He wants to measure our attitude, the way we spend our money, the way we spend our time, and our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may declare, "Hallelujah, I am in the local church!"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But you have to pass the test.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The test we all have to pass is not man's test, but the Lord's test.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is the man of brass holding the measuring reed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may feel that you are in the local church and that you have put everything on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His wisdom, the Lord would not measure a full four thousand cubits immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He measures gradually in units of one thousand cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If He would measure us in a complete way at one time, measuring four thousand cubits, we would not be able to take it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the same way that a mother feeds her little child a little at a time, the Lord measures us little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Each time the Lord measures us, He measures one thousand cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One thousand is a complete unit in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus would not measure you four thousand cubits immediately, but He has to measure you for a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The number four refers to the creation and specifically to man as the head of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fact that the measurement by the man of brass is in four times of one thousand cubits means that our entire being has to be possessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord does not want to possess merely a part of our being but our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our consecration must be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Absolute means four thousand cubits of being measured by the Lord so that our entire being is taken over by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the fourth time of measurement, Ezekiel tells us that the waters became a river that could not be passed over, "for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over" 47:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before the first time of measuring, the water trickled forth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the first time, it came up to the ankles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After the second time, it came to the knees.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the third time, it came to the loins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Finally, after the fourth time, no one could tell how deep the waters were.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It had become a river that could not be passed over, waters to swim in.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before getting into the flow, a person can walk easily on the dry land.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is very convenient to walk on dry land, but to walk in a place where water is trickling forth is inconvenient.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After a downpour, the water that trickles on the thoroughfares makes it somewhat inconvenient to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the water comes up to a person's ankles, it is even more bothersome to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When it comes up to the knees, it is even more difficult to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the water comes to the loins, a person can still move but with difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The deeper the flow of the water is and the more we are in this flow, the more inconvenient it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After being measured by the Lord, you will have the feeling that it is harder to move.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more grace you receive, the more you will be limited and bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the flow of grace rises to the loins, it is very difficult to move.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the hardest test.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At this time you may wish that you were not in the local church, and you may want to get away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, you cannot get away because you are encompassed with and surrounded by water.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the water is to the loins, your consecration is seventy-five percent; when it is to the knees, your consecration is fifty percent; and when it is to the ankles, your consecration is twenty-five percent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The time when you are seventy-five percent consecrated is the hardest time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At this time you may have sufficient grace so that it is not easy to lose your temper, and yet you do not have sufficient grace to overcome your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a real dilemma.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The grace is there, yet it is not deep enough.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You need to be measured again one thousand cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then the consecration will be one hundred percent.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When that time comes, no one knows the depth of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When there are waters to swim in, there is no need for you to move.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the time for you to rest because the flow of life is sustaining you, supporting you, and even carrying you away.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At that time, you will be able to say "Hallelujah" all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At that time there is no longer any human strength, human effort, or human struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The flow of life carries you along.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Human beings after the fall always like to move about in complete freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They do not like to be restricted in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we were on the dry land, it was easy to move.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As the water of life began to increase in our being, it became more restricting and bothersome.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You may feel that you have much strength and energy, but something within is binding and limiting you.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We may have told the Lord, "Lord, I surrender myself to You."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But it is not until the fourth time of measuring, that we will be fully surrendered.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At that time, there is no possibility of exercising our own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The only thing we can do in the waters is to swim.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We cannot pass over them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After you have been completely measured by the Lord, there is no need of your strength, your effort, or your struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At that time you will say, "Lord, I surrender myself to the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I commit myself to the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I stop all my effort and cease all my struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am resting in the flow and will let the flow carry me along."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We all need to ask ourselves how many steps of measuring we have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The picture in Ezekiel 47 is better than one thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We need to praise the Lord that we are in His house, yet we need to be measured thoroughly by Him.</S>
