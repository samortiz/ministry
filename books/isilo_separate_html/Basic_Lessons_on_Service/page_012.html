By Breaking the Bread to Apprehend<br>with Appreciation and Thanks<br>the Lord's Physical Body Being Broken for Us</H2><P>We remember the Lord by breaking the bread, by eating the bread, and by drinking the cup. In this lesson we want to talk only about breaking the bread. We remember the Lord not by thinking about, memorizing, or reckoning what the Lord did, but by breaking the bread. We break the bread to apprehend with appreciation and thanks the Lord's physical body being broken for us (Luke 22:19; 1 Cor. 11:24). Many of us do not care for the meaning of breaking the bread. We break the bread in the meeting to signify that the Lord's physical body was broken on the cross for us and for our sins.</P><P>In the next lesson we will cover more concerning our remembrance of the Lord at the Lord's table. The next crucial point we will see is our eating of the bread to enjoy the Lord as our life supply, to testify that we live by the Lord, and to have fellowship in Christ's mystical Body. Then we will fellowship concerning displaying the Lord's death, expressing our desire of the Lord's coming back, and worshipping the Father.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
