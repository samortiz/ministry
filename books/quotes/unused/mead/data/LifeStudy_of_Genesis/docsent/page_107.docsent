   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XXIX.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BALAAM, THE NICOLAITANS, AND JEZEBEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 2 mentions the doctrine of Balaam, the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, the teachings of Jezebel, and the depths of Satan Rev 2:14, 15, 20, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The early churches were deceived by such teachings and turned away from the eating of the Lord and the feasting with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, to turn the churches back to the enjoyment of Himself, the Lord made a promise to the churches that if they stay away from this kind of doctrine He will give them to eat of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Revelation 2:7 the Lord promises to give them to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Revelation 2:17 He promises to give them the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these two verses we see the tree that was in the garden of Eden and the manna that was in the wilderness, both of which are Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord did not say that He would give them teachings or that He would offer them a superior doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While Balaam and the Nicolaitans have their doctrines, Jezebel her teaching, and Satan his depths, the Lord Jesus has the tree of life and the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Revelation 3:20, the Lord promises a feast to everyone who will open to Him as He knocks on the door.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What does it mean to eat of the tree of life, to partake of the hidden manna, and to feast with the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It means that we stay continually on the line of life to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If, in the midst of the confusions and divisions of the day, we go along with the teachings, we will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, if we take care of the enjoyment of the Lord, that is, to be on the line of life, we will receive life and live.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>XXX.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE ANTICHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Antichrist will be a man completely in the mind with a strong, independent will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, he will be totally possessed by Satan and will even become the incarnation of Satan Rev 13:5-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is called "the man of lawlessness," "the son of destruction," because he will exalt himself as God 2Thes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He will be the giant on the line of knowledge in the Bible, knowing and caring for nothing on the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His destiny will be to suffer eternal death with Satan, the source of death Rev 19:20; 20:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>XXXI.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IN GENERAL</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a conclusion I want to refer to 2 Corinthians 3:6, which says, "the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The "letter" here refers to the Old Testament, and the same Greek word is rendered "writings" in 2 Timothy 3:15, where Paul mentions that Timothy knew the sacred writings since childhood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the Bible in dead letters, which belongs to the tree of knowledge, kills, while the Spirit, who belongs to the tree of life, gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we do have a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praise the Lord for this choice!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The choice of life!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Besides the line of knowledge there is the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must make a choice between life and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must choose between death and life.</S>
