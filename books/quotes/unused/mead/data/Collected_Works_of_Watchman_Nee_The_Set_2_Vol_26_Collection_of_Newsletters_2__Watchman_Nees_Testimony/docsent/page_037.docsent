   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER FROM BROTHER CHOU HSIN YI</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear Mr. Nee in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yesterday I sent two drafts of articles concerning the question of head covering and one notebook.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I hope you can check them and correct them for me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are many mistakes in the second article.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It would be best if someone could copy it over after you have corrected it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Last week I started to compile and translate the record of the last conference.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is very strange, and I do not know why, but this time there are more difficulties than usual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I had originally decided to spend two or three days transcribing one message so I could finish it in two months.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But as I have been writing, many unexpected things have occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am barely able to put a message together in four days.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It has become a great strain on me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I feel that I cannot use my brain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I cannot remember anything, and it is hard to focus my thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not have any strength in my prayer either.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My whole being feels weak, and I do not have mental energy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I cannot resist all these conditions!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before, I only had to resist with some strength, and then my energy would return.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nothing works now, it seems as if there is not even the slightest bit of warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In my heart I want to do this, but something hinders me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The worst thing is that I have forgotten many of the things that I used to remember.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, I think that I will be able to do it well, Mr. Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I will need your help, however, to get through this difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I must not fail in this matter, no matter what.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope you will give me some leading to get through this kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I received the 1913 and 1914 issues of The Overcomer from England a few days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I finally obtained the books that I wanted for so long.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am really happy!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May the Lord allow me to gain the riches from it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Shen Wei Chih came to Hangchow to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The three of us live together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every day he helps me do some transcribing work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peace through the winter!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hsin Yi</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>November 8</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>NEWS FROM SISTER YU SU CHEN</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Greetings to Mr. Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A few days ago Miss Lee and the sisters passed through Nanking on their way to Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I went to the boat to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I heard that you were sick, and I wondered whether you had gotten better.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank God for His grace, I received much spiritual training in the last conference at Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Of all the conferences we have had over the past few years, the last one was unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I constantly thank and praise the Father God!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although I constantly fail, He is never willing to let me go.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His holy hand is always stretched out to deal with me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have been in Nanking for more than six months.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A few sisters meet together on the Lord's Day to pray and read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After coming back from Hangchow, I planned to terminate this sisters' meeting to wait for the Lord's time to bring brothers to Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I also planned to do some individual work so I did not announce that we would meet again.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the sisters came of their own accord; for the last three weeks we have had sisters' meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I heard that the Chin Ling Men's Seminary has some brothers who love the Lord, who want to invite you to Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is a Brother Wang among them who was clearly saved through you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He once told a sister that if you could come to Nanking to meet in any place, they would have many people who would come to hear you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Their students often ask, "What should we preach when we go out?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The sister told me this later, and I have prayed for this often since then.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the twenty-ninth Sister Rachel Lee told me on the boat that you bear the responsibility for the regions of Chenkiang and Nanking, so I mentioned this matter to Sister Rachel Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you can come to Nanking, we invite you to stay with us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is very convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The meeting place can hold fifty to sixty people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is my respectful report.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is another question that I hope you can answer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A sister used the train with a free ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After she was enlightened, she decided to pay back this money.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to the principles of the Bible, property should be returned to its rightful owner, but the person who got the free tickets for her is a member of a denomination who is in the middle of committing a great sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If she gives this money to him, he would not give it to the government or the railroad, and it would give him more opportunity to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although this sister was saved when she used a free ticket, she had not consecrated herself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now all that she has is given to God, so this amount is consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whom should she return this money to?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Please advise us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This sister will also add a fifth part so that the total comes to about one hundred fifty dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Where should she send it?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are waiting for an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>From,</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Yu Su Chen</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>November 7</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Answer from Brother Tang Shou Ling</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Use a post office money order and send it in a double registered letter to the Railroad Authority.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Enclose an explanation: She rode the train on a free ticket which was obtained unlawfully.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Since she has believed in the Lord Jesus and has been saved, she knows that this is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In addition to the amount of the tickets, she is adding on twenty percent interest and returning the money.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>She does not need to mention who got the free tickets for her.</S>
