   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PART TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HOW TO BE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD'S DEPUTY AUTHORITY CHAPTER TWELVE THE KIND OF PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>GOD USES TO BE HIS DEPUTY AUTHORITY SUBMISSION TO DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND BEING A DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's children must learn to know authority and find out to whom they should submit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Wherever we go, the first thing we should ask is whose authority should we be under.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As soon as we move to a place, we should not expect to be the master, asking others to submit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, we should be like the centurion, who told the Lord Jesus, "For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me" Matt 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here was a man who truly knew authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He could submit to authority; therefore, he was able to be a deputy authority himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have said that God upholds and maintains the whole universe with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He also begets His children with His authority John 1:12 and binds them together with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, if a man is independent, individualistic, and free from any God-appointed deputy authority, he is an outsider as far as God's administration over the whole universe is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He cannot get along with other children of God, and as such, he cannot accomplish God's work on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has established deputy authorities in the church; the church is built up and maintained by the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason every child of God should look for the authority to whom he should submit so that he can coordinate with others in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Unfortunately, many people have failed in this point.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not know the object of our faith, we cannot believe in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not know the object of our love, we cannot love anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we want a person to believe in something, we first must show him the object of his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we want a person to love someone, we first must show him the object of his love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the same way, if we do not know the object of our submission, we will not know how to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to teach a person submission, we first must let him know the person to whom he should submit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are many deputy authorities in the church to whom we should render submission.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we submit to them, we are submitting to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many people can preach submission, but they themselves cannot submit to any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be a person who submits to authority before we can be a deputy authority ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, we cannot submit only to those whom we love; we have to learn to submit to all authorities over us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even the policeman on the street is an object of our submission.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE NEED TO ENCOUNTER AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>IN A THOROUGH WAY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are many authorities in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are over you, and you have to learn to submit to all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have to learn to face all kinds of authority, and you must recognize authority in others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once you encounter authority in a person, you have to learn to submit to that person immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You should not weigh him carefully and then decide if you should submit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you consider whether or not a person is worthy of submission before you submit to him, you have only encountered the person himself; you have not encountered authority itself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a man has not met authority, he can never be a deputy authority himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a man does not know how to submit to authority, he cannot be God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Unless a man first deals with rebellion in himself, he does not know how to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Unless we first judge the sin of rebellion in us, we cannot know what submission is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's children should not be unorganized and tangled yarn or a mob of undisciplined people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If there is no testimony of submission among God's children, there will be no church, and there will be no ministry and no work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must realize that this is a grave problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must have a very serious dealing before the Lord, and must encounter the matter of authority in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to learn to submit to one another, and we must learn to submit to deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only after that can we begin to learn to be a deputy authority.</S>
