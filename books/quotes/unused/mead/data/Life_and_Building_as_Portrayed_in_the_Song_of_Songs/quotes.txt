[1]  Loving Christ the Person Loving the Lord for His Purpose How to Take Christ as Life Eight Stages of Growth in Life The Subdued and Resurrected Will The Move of a Living Person The Garden and the City The Corporate Life as Seen in the Garden From the Garden to the City Producing the Body of Christ The Dance of Two Armies Equipped to Work with the Lord Transfigured to Meet the Lord Living Stones for the Building The Destination of Building
[2]  So if we have life, normally speaking, we should have building; and if we would have building we must have life.
[3]  Because spiritual gifts are mentioned in the Bible, Christians may have the misunderstanding that gifts are something of life.
[4]  But the life which we have received of the Lord Jesus is not a mere life; it is a Person!
[5]  We do praise the Lord that many have been turned to the Lord and attracted to the church life.
[6]  CHAPTER TWO LOVING CHRIST THE PERSON Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:14; 2 Cor 5:14-15; Gal 2:20; John 14:21, 23; 21:15-19; Rev 2:4
[7]  In the first chapter, we saw that life is simply Christ Himself.
[8]  We can deal with many things without love, but we cannot deal with a person without love.
[9]  He tells us, " he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him" 14:21, 23 .
[10]  It is by His grace that we believed in the Lord Jesus, and it is also by His grace that we love the Lord Jesus.
[11]  Have you ever noticed how long Galatians 2:20 is?
[12]  If we really love the Lord Jesus, we will have the power and strength to do anything for Him.
[13]  The Lord Jesus is not a doctrine; He is not a set of gifts or a power; He is a Person who needs our love, our appreciation, and our affection.
[14]  Suppose I tell a certain brother that I love him.
[15]  The Lord was saying that to take Him as our life and as our Person, we must take His desire as our desire.
[16]  He needs someone like Peter to love Him, someone to tell Him, "O Lord Jesus, I love You!
[17]  If we will pray in this way, we will see what love we will have toward the Lord and what kind of life we will live.
[18]  CHAPTER THREE LOVING THE LORD FOR HIS PURPOSE Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:2-4, 13-14; 2:3-4, 8-10, 16-17; 3:1-4 RECEIVE AND ENJOY
[19]  We have seen that to believe in the Lord is to receive Him, and that to love Him is to enjoy what we have received.
[20]  In John 14:21 and 23, the Lord says that when we love Him, He will manifest Himself to us.
[21]  But just by that calling, "O Lord," Jesus came into His persecutor and turned him into one who loved the Lord.
[22]  The stronger a person is, the more problems he will give you if you love him and Jesus is the strongest Person.
[23]  Though we say we love Jesus, and we really mean it, we have a real problem: we are loving the strongest Person with the strongest personality.
[24]  Do you see the discrepancy between the Lord and the seeking one?
[25]  She intends to have rest and stay at home, but the Lord intends that she rise up and go away.
[26]  Even though she says that she is not ready, and that the Lord must wait until the shadows flee away, the Lord will not go along with her.
[27]  CHAPTER FOUR HOW TO TAKE CHRIST AS LIFE Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:9-11, 15; 2:2, 14; 3:6-7a, 9, 11
[28]  Two books in the Bible are closely related: the Gospel of John, which tells us how to take the Lord Jesus as our life, and the Song of Songs, which deals with loving the Lord.
[29]  Apparently, these two books have no relationship with one another, but in experience we have found that the real way to enjoy the Lord as our life is found in the Song of Songs.
[30]  If we would pray over the eight chapters of this book in the spirit, we would see how to take the Lord as our life.
[31]  It does not speak about taking the Lord as our Savior or our Redeemer, but as our life.
[32]  She loves the Lord and she is seeking the Lord.
[33]  The Song of Songs is the unique book in the Bible showing us the proper way, not only to love the Lord, but also to enjoy Him as our life.
[34]  If we are going to enjoy the Lord as life, we must see this discrepancy.
[35]  The Lord is training and disciplining the seeking one to forget about herself, her personality, and her will, and to take the Lord Himself as her Person.
[36]  Now we need to see a little more in these chapters.
[37]  In all of the above verses, the Lord Jesus appraised the seeking one in a certain way.
[38]  "Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart" 3:11 .
[39]  CHAPTER FIVE EIGHT STAGES OF GROWTH IN LIFE Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:9, 15; 2:2, 14; 3:6, 7, 9, 10, 11 A FAMILY OF DESCRIPTION
[40]  In the last chapter we saw the Lord's appraisal of the seeking one in the first three chapters of the Song of Songs.
[41]  We need to look at all eight figures in more detail.
[42]  After having the eyes of the dove, she becomes a lily.
[43]  The Lord says in Matthew 6:28-30, " Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
[44]  Not only did the Lord Himself consider the seeking one here as a lily, but even she herself recognized that she was a lily.
[45]  We must also stay in the secret of the steep places, where we experience the Lord's ascension.
[46]  If I am troubled by a certain person or a particular situation, I must pray, "O Lord Jesus, keep me in the cleft of the rock, and help me to stay in the secret of the steep places.
[47]  She is not only the couch for Solomon to rest in at night, she is also the palanquin for Him to move in by day.
[48]  CHAPTER SIX THE SUBDUED AND RESURRECTED WILL Scripture Reading: S. S. 3:6-11; 4:1, 4 A LOSS OF PERSONALITY
[49]  In all of the figures mentioned in the previous chapter, there is a great change in the character, in the personality, and especially in the will of the seeking one.
[50]  By the time the seeking one comes out of the wilderness, she has lost her personality.
[51]  Now we come to chapter four, which is a continuation of chapter three.
[52]  When the question was first asked about the seeking one coming out of the wilderness, the answer did not come from the Lord Himself, but from someone else.
[53]  The Lord speaks of her beauty as still being in her eyes, but now something is added.
[54]  Chapter three tells us of the maturity of the seeking one, and chapter four continues by explaining how she reached such a mature stage.
[55]  Eventually, she is reckoned by the Lord as Jerusalem.
[56]  Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:4a, 7a, 8a, 9, 12-16a; 2:2-4, 14, 16; 3:6; 4:1; Jer 50:19; Micah 7:14 THE NEED OF A LIVING PERSON
[57]  We have already seen many points about how to take Christ as our living Person in the Song of Songs.
[58]  The Lord today is going to recover His living Person.
[59]  In the Song of Songs, we see one who sought the Lord, and by her seeking, she found Him.
[60]  As we appreciate and enjoy the Lord, something of the element of the Lord is taken into us and eventually becomes us.
[61]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE GARDEN AND THE CITY Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:11; 3:6, 9, 10; 4:4a, 6, 12-16; 5:1; 6:2, 4 LIFE IS FOR BUILDING
[62]  We must keep in mind that the theme of all these chapters on the Song of Songs is life and building.
[63]  It is not only a matter of life, but also of building.
[64]  If we did not have the experience and the light from the Lord, even though we were scholars in the language and poetry of this book, I do not believe we could see the real significance here.
[65]  In chapter six, we see the last figure used by the Lord to describe the seeker.
[66]  "Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners" v. 4 . So we have the garden and the city.
[67]  For us to be the palanquin and the crown of the Lord is indeed wonderful.
[68]  He was her enjoyment, but now what He is has been wrought into her, and she is growing it back to Him for His enjoyment.
[69]  In this book there are many seekings, many findings, and many satisfactions.
[70]  At least four or five times the seeking one begins again to seek for the Lord.
[71]  It is not only a matter of being a boast to Him as a crown; we must grow something for the Lord Jesus to eat and enjoy.
[72]  Today's Christianity is very lacking in all of these matters.
[73]  This is what the Lord is doing in His recovery, and this is why we say this is not the recovery of doctrine.
[74]  CHAPTER NINE THE CORPORATE LIFE AS SEEN IN THE GARDEN Scripture Reading: S. S. 4:6-16; 5:1 FROM A COMPANY OF HORSES TO A CITY
[75]  The seeking one in the Song of Songs is likened by the Lord at the beginning to a company of horses.
[76]  The Lord said to her, "I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots" 1:9 .
[77]  This indicated that the Lord was saying, "My love, you do love Me, yet you are still carrying something of the world; you are still related to the prince of the world.
[78]  Yet, even after all of these appraisals, she still says, "Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense" 4:6 .
[79]  Regardless of how well others appraise her, including the Lord, she still has the feeling that the day is not breaking and some shadows still exist.
[80]  At this time the Lord gives her a further call.
[81]  I do not believe that any one of us would want to leave if we had reached such an attainment, but the Lord called her to leave.
[82]  Calling on the Lord and exercising our spirit are indeed wonderful, but we all must realize that these spiritual practices are only to help us enter into the death and resurrection of the Lord.
[83]  Before the seeking one became a garden, she never grew anything for the Lord.
[84]  Then in chapter two, she enjoyed the Lord as the apple tree, and she was brought into the house of wine.
[85]  In chapter three, she was even perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, that is, she was permeated and mingled with the Lord.
[86]  She appreciated the Lord, she enjoyed the Lord, and she was even permeated with the Lord, but she never grew anything to the Lord.
[87]  At first it was something of the Lord getting into her; now it is something of the Lord growing out of her, because all of these things have been wrought into her, have permeated her, and have become a part of her.
[88]  Contentment with our spiritual attainments is a real problem.
[89]  After arriving at the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense, we are transferred to the mountain of Lebanon, and once there, we want to stay.
[90]  It is not only by the adequate experiences of the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension, for after we have reached the mountaintop, we must answer the call from the Lord to leave our attainment and return to the place where the Lord intends to fulfill His purpose.
[91]  We have seen that the Song of Songs is clearly divided into two sections.
[92]  In the first three chapters she appreciates and enjoys the Lord, and she is permeated with the Lord.
[93]  In the first section the Lord was everything to her, but now in the second section the Lord enjoys everything out of her.
[94]  We tell the Lord that we are going to fast and pray for three days, but the Lord says, "Take something to eat and go to sleep."
[95]  Now the seeking one has answered the Lord's call to come down to the valley to become a garden.
[96]  The garden is at the beginning of the sixty-six books, and the city is at the end. She is now a garden, growing out the things she once enjoyed of the Lord; however, even in being a garden, some kind of discrepancy between her and the Lord still exists.
[97]  "I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.
[98]  I realize that this point is not so easy to understand, but we must see it very clearly.
[99]  For the seeking ones of the Lord to deny the world is a marvelous thing; to deny themselves is even more glorious.
[100]  But one day the Lord will call us to deny our spiritual attainment, even as He did.
[101]  The seeking one who reached such high attainment in her spiritual life still has some discrepancy between her and the Lord.
[102]  CHAPTER ELEVEN PRODUCING THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: S. S. 5:2-6, 8, 16; 6:1-6; Phil 3:10; Col 1:24
[103]  The Song of Songs is really a wonderful book.
[104]  Again we must say that our intention is not merely to understand this book.
[105]  After the seeking one became a lily, she began to enjoy the Lord.
[106]  At first, she appreciated the Lord as a bundle of myrrh and as a cluster of henna flowers, but at that time she had not yet begun to enjoy the Lord.
[107]  By eating and drinking of the Lord, some of the elements of the Lord were wrought into her.
[108]  It was not only by appreciating the Lord, but by taking the Lord Himself into her in a way of enjoyment that some of the Lord's very element entered into her and caused her to be transformed substantially.
[109]  Then she came out of her spiritual wilderness, which was just her will.
[110]  She was dealt with by the Lord to such an extent that her personality was gone.
[111]  By this time she had enjoyed the Lord richly, but she had never produced anything for the Lord's enjoyment.
[112]  She must become a garden to grow out something for the Lord and for His people.
[113]  Hence, she did become a garden producing all the things she enjoyed of the Lord in the past.
[114]  Paul said in Philippians 3:10 that he wanted to know the fellowship of the sufferings of Christ.
[115]  If the Lord had stayed in the heavens, He would never have been a man who suffered on the earth.
[116]  We may think that we love the Lord, but when we begin to suffer for His Body's sake, the love between us and the Lord will become exceedingly sweet.
[117]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE DANCE OF TWO ARMIES Scripture Reading: S. S. 5:4-6, 8-9, 16; 6:1-6, 10, 13 FOUR ATTAINMENTS
[118]  As we have seen in the past chapters, the seeking one in the Song of Songs reached at least four attainments.
[119]  Due to this, a discrepancy arose between her and the Lord.
[120]  Formerly, she was enjoying the Lord, but now she is producing the Lord.
[121]  When she saw the Lord's hand, she stretched out her hands.
[122]  She saw the hand of the Lord, and she replied with her hands dripping with myrrh.
[123]  To work for the Lord by going to the mission field or preaching the gospel is one thing, but to work for the Lord with the sweet smell of myrrh is quite another.
[124]  Now the seeking one says, "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies" 6:3 .
[125]  It is not so much that the Lord is for me as it is that I am for the Lord.
[126]  Just as Paul suffered to fill up the lack of the afflictions of Christ for His Body's sake, this one knows the Lord with the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.
[127]  Eventually, some of her admirers ask her to return: "Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee.
[128]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN EQUIPPED TO WORK WITH THE LORD Scripture Reading: S. S. 7:1, 4, 5, 6-8, 10-13 THE ETERNAL PURPOSE OF GOD
[129]  If you are one who is simply seeking spirituality for your personal satisfaction, you will not suffer much.
[130]  Rather, all the people of God will appreciate you and speak well of you because you are seeking spirituality.
[131]  Now we come to the Lord's final appraisal of the seeking one.
[132]  Since she has reached the consummate attainment, she is now ready to work for the Lord.
[133]  Following the eyes, the Lord appraises her nose: "Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus" 7:4 .
[134]  The Lord has never mentioned anything about her nose until now.
[135]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN TRANSFIGURED TO MEET THE LORD Scripture Reading: S. S. 8:1, 5-10, 13-14; Rom 8:21-23; 2 Cor 11:2; Deut 4:24 A WIDER SIGHT
[136]  In the last chapter, we saw how the seeking one took the initiative to work with the Lord.
[137]  Then, she asked the Lord to go with her to lodge in the villages.
[138]  Again, she asked the Lord to go with her to visit the vineyard to see all of the blooming and budding plants.
[139]  If we are really qualified to work in the Lord and with the Lord, our scope and our sight will be widely broadened.
[140]  Chapter eight of the Song of Songs reveals this final stage of our Christian experience.
[141]  Of course some may argue that the New Testament says that we will be the same as the Lord.
[142]  But to say that one day we will be like Jesus is not so deep as to say that one day Jesus will be like us.
[143]  At this point, someone asks again about the seeking one coming up from the wilderness.
[144]  Following the Lord's answer, the seeking one prays a prayer.
[145]  At this point in chapter eight, it seems that the Lord and the seeking one have fellowship together.
[146]  "We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
[147]  If she be a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar" 8:8-9 .
[148]  This chapter does not say what we should do with her if she is hungry or thirsty, but that if she is a wall, we will build upon her, or if she is a door, we will build with her.
[149]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN LIVING STONES FOR THE BUILDING Scripture Reading: John 1:42; Matt 16:16-18; 1 Cor 3:9-13; 1 Pet 2:5; Eph 2:22; Rev 21:18-19a, 14
[150]  The Lord's recovery is the recovery of life and building.
[151]  In these chapters we have been considering life and building in the Song of Songs.
[152]  The Apostle Paul also speaks about a building with stones.
[153]  Some may say that since the churches are all-inclusive, we need many things.
[154]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE DESTINATION OF BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:2; 1 Cor 1:10; 3:6; Eph 4:2-3, 15-16; Phil 2:2-3
[155]  The final need of the seeking one is the building up.
[156]  We may be like a company of horses, or so improved that we are like a dove or even a palanquin, but we still need to go on to be the city!
[157]  He is our God, our Creator, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Lord, our life-giving Spirit, our way, our life, our everything!
[158]  Up to the first part of this century the Lord used many different saints to recover numerous items for His recovery.
[159]  It is not simply some teaching, revelation, vision, theory, or principle of the Body that the Lord is seeking, but a real, solid practice of the church life.
[160]  We must cooperate with the Lord by saying, "Lord, now is the time.
[161]  If we mean business in taking Jesus into us in this way, we will experience a real change in life.
[162]  When we eat Jesus, all the nourishing elements of His life give us the metabolism which produces all kinds of expressions in our human conduct.
[163]  By these experiences we are not only built up, but also built in. If others try to pull us out of the church, they cannot do it.
