[1]  Can a believer know that he has eternal life?
[2]  Let us now read a few portions of the Scriptures to see if we can know that we have eternal life.
[3]  First, please read 1 John 5:13: "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God."
[4]  It does not say to hope or to believe; rather, it says, "Let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you; and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified."
[5]  Since the Lord has said that those who believe in Him would not perish but have eternal life, do you think that after we have believed, that we will still perish?
