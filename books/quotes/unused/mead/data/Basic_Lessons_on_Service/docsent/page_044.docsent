   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Right Thigh as a Heave Offering unto the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The right thigh of the peace offering was also given to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings Lev 7:32-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The one cake and the right thigh were for nourishing and strengthening the serving priest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The cake was for nourishing, the thigh was for strengthening, and both were heave offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This refers to the enjoyment of the ascension of Christ, to enjoying Christ as the ascended One, the heaved One.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This shows that the offering priests, the conducting priests, get the highest enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we serve, the higher the portion of Christ we enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To All the Priests</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>the Breast as a Wave Offering</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The breast as a wave offering was a portion of the peace offering to all the priests, including Aaron and all his sons Lev 7:30-31, 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The wave offering is not as high as the heave offering, and the breast is not as strong as the thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, all the priests share a portion which is not as high or as strong as that which the serving priests share.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The highest and strongest portion is for the serving priests, not for the general priests.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The general priests share only a kind of general portion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They share the wave breast, not the heave thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The wave offering signifies the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The heave offering signifies the exalted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The exalted Christ, of course, is higher than the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Until we experience Christ in ascension, we have not reached the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are still on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The breast does not signify strength; it signifies love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that as long as the church is still in the stage of love it is not so strong and somewhat low.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church must go on from the stage of love to the stage of strength, that is, from the breast stage to the thigh stage.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If there are many general priests among us and few serving priests, our church life will be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need some particular serving ones to enjoy the right thigh as a heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To the Offerer</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A portion of the peace offering also goes to the offerer.</S>
