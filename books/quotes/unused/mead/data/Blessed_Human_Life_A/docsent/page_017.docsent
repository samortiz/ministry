   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING A DREAM OF A BROAD HIGHWAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I rarely have dreams when I sleep, but I had a dream one night.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the dream I held a cane in my hand, walking peacefully until I came to a place with a steep, crooked downward slope with four steps.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I went down the slope step by step, leaning on my cane, and suddenly a German shepherd dog threw itself on me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The German shepherd was the same color as that of the uniform of the Japanese military police.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The German shepherd threw itself on me, but I was not wounded, and in an instant the dog went away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suddenly, when I looked ahead, there was a broad highway very straight and stretching on boundlessly, and the sun had just risen from the east.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My heart then felt free and released, and seeing the broad highway, the rising sun, and the boundless, bright horizon, I strode fearlessly onward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was my dream.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The broad highway, the rising sun, and the boundless horizon greatly comforted me within.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through the dream the Lord told me, Be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You are not under the hand of the Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Japanese army was like the German shepherd attacking me, but eventually it could not hurt me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I knew that the Lord still wanted me to remain on the earth, because there was a broad highway ahead, and I could just keep going on.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Two or three weeks later, as usual, I went to the meeting hall before eight in the morning to take care of some things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As soon as I stepped into the meeting hall, there came two men dressed in blue Chinese long gowns.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Right away I knew that one of them was Japanese and the other was a Chinese traitor as the interpreter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Japanese officer said, Mr. Lee, please excuse us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are here to visit you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I welcomed them into the room which I used to pray and read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I had the Lord s leading within and gave him a pocket-sized Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the end he told me, I apologize, Mr. Lee, but we have to ask you to come to our headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have a few matters to discuss with you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was then brought to the military police headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After I got there, they told me that they were very busy, and they asked me to be seated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I waited past lunchtime and dinnertime and was detained until nine or ten in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then they told me that it was late and that I should sleep overnight there and wait for the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time they did not put me in a prison cell right away but let me sleep on a bed belonging to a military policeman.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That night I dreamed again: The German shepherd ran around me, harassing me, but because of the previous dream, I knew that it could not harm me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The next morning they brought me to the interrogation chamber where there were cold water and wooden boards.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They made me lie on a wooden board, and then they poured cold water on me, into my mouth and nostrils and all over my body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Afterward, they gave me someone s name and asked if I knew that person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That person was a brother among us who had gone to Chungking from the inland a few months ago.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They asked me where he was hiding.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I said that I did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then they asked me how he got there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I told them the church wrote a letter of recommendation for him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While they were interrogating me, I was looking to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For anything in which I could not reveal the truth, I would ask the Lord, O Lord, do not let them ask me about it, and they truly did not ask at all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever they asked, I was able to answer calmly and truthfully.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the interrogation, they let me rest and then dragged me to the prison cell.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then they went to my house and the meeting hall to find the responsible ones to verify the statements I gave under interrogation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I was tortured in this way for more than three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One night I had another dream.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I dreamed that I was in a brother s home in my neighborhood, and a puppy crawled out of a dog hole, wagging its tail at me and running toward me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I woke up I felt very happy and peaceful, because I knew that the Japanese military police were coming to me to wag their tails and send me home.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time they interrogated me twice a day, for close to two or three hours each time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The next day, instead of interrogating they said to me, Mr. Lee, we are young and impetuous.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please excuse us for any lack of respect.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They wanted to escort me home, but they had to wait until the evening, so they treated me to a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more they chattered, the more I felt they were like puppies wagging their tails.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The week after they sent me home, in the afternoon on the Lord s Day after I finished ministering the word, I sat down to partake of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the bread and cup were passed to me, I had a trance similar to Peter s. In the trance I saw a white dog before me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This dog was not like the previous German shepherd or the hole-crawling puppy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I then realized that the Japanese were coming for me again.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As expected, after the Lord s Day they came again, requesting me to do a little work for them, saying that since I was a member of the church and had many contacts, I should help them investigate those who were Communists.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This was difficult for me, since I did not know much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Besides, I would never do anything that would be harmful to my fellow countrymen.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A week later, they came to ask me if I had any information for them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I said no. Another week later, I still answered no.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the time I had to go to the Japanese military police and apply for entry and exit permits because I did not have the freedom to travel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, I contracted a severe case of tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After being ill for half a year, they received news of my illness and thought I was incapacitated and therefore useless, so they released me from their grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, I escaped from the hands of the Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In October of 1944 I left Chefoo and fled to Tsingtao, where I recuperated for one and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Japan surrendered in 1945, and shortly afterward the Communist army advanced into Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The first thing they did in Chefoo was to come to my home to look for me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All these events that occurred were evidences of the Lord s preserving me, enabling me to escape out of the hands of the Japanese and the Communists.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It has been over forty years since I first had the dream in 1943.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After I had fully recovered from tuberculosis in 1946, the brothers in Shanghai and Nanking asked me to go there, so I went.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>That brought in a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then the political situation in mainland China became desperate, so Brother Nee and all the co-workers decided to send me overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I came to Taiwan and saw the Lord s blessing the whole time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Later, when I went to Southeast Asia, I again saw the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Even after I went to the United States, the Lord s blessing was also evidently present.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is today s situation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I can say that every day I am walking on the broad highway, step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Especially today, seeing the development of this new way, it is truly a broad highway and a rising sun, with a boundless prospect.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I really feel that this dream is still being fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>THE BROAD HIGHWAY OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As we look at today s world situation, review past history, observe the condition of Christianity, and consider the light shown to us in the Scriptures, it is not difficult to conclude that this is a critical moment in time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A British brother brought to me a copy of The Times, in which the statistics of Christianity in England are published: the Catholic Church has the most members, totaling 2.5 million; the Presbyterians also have 2.5 million.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Beginning from 1970 the numbers dropped greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In 1990 the Catholic Church are expected to drop down to an estimated 1.8 million, while the Presbyterians are expected to drop down to an estimated 1.7 million.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All the other denominations are in the process of losing members as well.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, in the list of statistics there is a group of Christians called the home churches, which had not been in existence before 1970 but currently has eighty to ninety thousand members.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This shows that the population of the whole of Christianity is decreasing all over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In other words, Christianity has no way, no future.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Supposedly Christianity has spread to the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>According to the numbers, however, in Taiwan there are less than five hundred thousand Christians in a total population of twenty million; therefore, the percentage of Christians is less than 2.5.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is to say that for every one hundred Taiwan residents, there are less than two and a half saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The island of Taiwan has easy and convenient transportation, but Christianity has been here for more than two centuries without producing much result.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Christianity all over the earth is in the same condition.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Supposedly Christianity has been preached over the whole earth; in reality, it is low in number.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This certainly is a critical moment.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Since the Lord has now shown us the new way and has called us to take the new way, we must keep up with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If the new way solely relies on the working saints to go out knocking on doors in their spare time, it will truly not be adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This way must rely on young, capable, and educated brothers and sisters receiving the burden to go full-time, serving the Lord every day and every hour.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I hope that from this day onward the number of full-timers will increase year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is the Lord s calling for us today.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I genuinely believe that the dream I had was a real vision.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The past forty years that we have gone through proves that the dream has been fulfilled, and now we are still on this broad highway.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>At this point in time we particularly need young people to rise up and serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>There is nothing more glorious than serving full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Consider this: The gaining of a million dollars cannot compare to the gaining of one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we can spend several years to labor and save several thousand souls through door-knocking, and if they multiply continually, each bringing in new ones and establishing home meetings, and each maturing in life and learning the truth, how worthwhile it will be!</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is the broad highway, the rising sun, and the boundless future.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>A message given in Taipei, Taiwan on May 23, 1987</S>
