   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BREATHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then we come to the last point we mentioned, that of the Lord's breathing into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself as life into them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>DRINKING, EATING, AND BREATHING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we consider these various items covered in John, we realize how vital they are for our existence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without drinking, eating, and breathing we could not live.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These three means for our physical existence are all used by the Lord Jesus to illustrate how we may take Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is our water, more refreshing than the best earthly drink.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must drink Him!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is our bread.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must eat Him!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Bread is not merely to be looked at.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Its purpose is to be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This living bread must be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not think that to say this is uncultured and wild.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He says Himself that we must eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is our breath, imparting Himself as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must breathe Him!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This enjoyment of Jesus is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is this that He would recover among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jesus is the living water, the living bread, and the living breath.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must drink of Him, eat Him, and breathe Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE WAY TO TAKE CHRIST IN</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are two ways by which we may drink, eat, and breathe Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"It is the Spirit Who gives life; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This verse mentions both the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The very Word revealed in John 1:1 eventually became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is this Spirit who is the water, the bread, and the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 20:22 reads, "Receive the Holy pneuma."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Greek word pneuma may be translated either as spirit or as breath.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is equally correct to say, "Receive the Holy Spirit" or "Receive the holy breath."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit today is our breath.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This breath is Jesus, the incarnate Word who went to the cross, entered into resurrection, and ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He then returned to us as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have the Word outside us and the Spirit inside us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Day by day we must come to the Word, not only with our mind but also with our heart and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we open the Bible, we must open our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must read not only with our understanding but also with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible is not an ordinary book.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this holy Word there is life, the Spirit, God, and Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These are all contained in the Word and are conveyed to us as we open ourselves and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This prayerful reading of the Word is the eating, drinking, and breathing in of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How would you answer if someone asked you where God is?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not say that God is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Heaven is too far away.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How could one get there to find Him?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God, you must tell him, is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He also is in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Where is the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Where is life?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The answer to these two questions is also "in the Word."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE WORD AS A SEED</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you plant a little stone or a piece of rock in the soil, nothing will come up, even if you wait for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the other hand, if you sow a tiny seed into the soil, in just a matter of days it will sprout.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This sprouting proves that the seed contains life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Where is life to be found?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is found in a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Did you know that the word of God in the Bible is a seed?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever" 1 Pet 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The word in the Bible is a seed, conveying life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What, then, is the soil?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our heart is the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must open our heart to receive the Word just as the soil must be opened to receive the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is the water?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Spirit is the water.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we come to the Bible and open ourselves, the very seed of the Word gets into us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more you pray, breathing the air, the more the Spirit as the water is added to you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The air of prayer mingled with the water of the Spirit produces the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Much dew becomes a river.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is a seed, planted in the soil of your heart, and watered by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It sprouts and grows till the blossom appears and the fruit comes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The reason Christ can be the water, the bread of life, and the breath is that He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is the Spirit, compounded with divinity, humanity, human living, the death of the cross, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All these are wrapped up in this life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>And you can find Him in the Bible!</S>
