   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Its Growth and Building Up Being in the Realm of the Genuine Oneness of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the church is not an organization, but the Body of Christ, the living organism of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As such an organism, the Body of Christ grows and is being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Its growth and building up both are in the realm of the genuine oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time, the oneness was not in existence among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was just a model that existed merely among the three of the Divine Trinity, the Father, the Son and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus prayed that the believers might be one, even as the Father was in Him and He in the Father John 17:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was aspiring that this oneness in the Triune God would be realized among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This oneness in the Divine Trinity was not realized among the believers until the day of Pentecost when the consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God, was poured out upon the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit is now mingled with all the believers, making all the believers one with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now on the earth there is in existence a reality called the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The oneness of the Triune God is now realized among all the believers because the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God is now mingled with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul specifically charged us that we should be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit Eph 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to Ephesians 4, the oneness of the Spirit is composed of four factors, two means, and one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The four factors are the one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The one Body is the object.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When this one Body, the object, is mingled with the Divine Trinity, that is, the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God and Father of all, there is the reality of the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This oneness through the mingling of the consummated Spirit with the redeemed and regenerated ones is our possession.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This oneness is accomplished by two means: the means of faith and of baptism v. 5 . Through faith we are joined to Christ, who is our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Faith is our believing into Christ, bringing us into an organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Baptism is the termination of all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Baptism separates us from Adam, and faith joins us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This brings us into a unique goal, that is, the one hope of our calling v. 4 . The goal of the oneness of the Spirit is the hope that one day all the believers as the Body of Christ will be brought into the divine glory of the Triune God Col 1:27 . Our hope is not on the earth, nor is our hope to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our hope is to participate in the divine glory of the Triune God.</S>
