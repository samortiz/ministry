        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING UP AND<br />
THE MANIFESTATION OF FUNCTIONS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:4-5; Eph. 4:11-13, 15-16</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that to be built up is to be fitly joined and firmly knit together with others. In this chapter we will consider the relationship between building up and the manifestation of our function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST AND THEIR FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>Most of the saints feel that they do not function, even though they are saved. Their condition seems to confirm such a feeling, and they even speak of their uselessness. Whether in relation to their feelings or their condition, it appears as though they do not have any function.</p>
<p>We should believe in God&rsquo;s Word and not our feelings. We should believe what He says and not in our condition. The Word says that every believer is a member of the Body of Christ and that every member has a function (Rom. 12:4-5). Our function can be considered as a gift or a ministry. No matter how we feel, God&rsquo;s Word says that every saved person has a function. Hence, we should believe what God says rather than our feelings or condition.</p>
<p>If we look at our condition, sometimes we even doubt whether we are saved. However, in the Bible God tells us, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:36). Based on this word, we should believe that we are saved. Likewise, we should also believe that as a member in the Body of Christ, we have a function. If we acknowledge that we are saved, we should also acknowledge that we are a member of the Body of Christ. As a member of the Body of Christ, we have no reason to say that we do not have a function.</p>
<p>In Matthew 24:35 the Lord said, &ldquo;Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.&rdquo; According to our view, heaven and earth are concrete and real, but the Bible says that one day both heaven and earth will pass away. Hence, heaven and earth are transient and vain. In the universe only God and His word are eternal and real. If heaven and earth are not real, how can our feelings and condition be real? Therefore, we should not believe in our feelings or our condition.</p>
<p>Romans 12:4-5 says, &ldquo;Just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.&rdquo; These verses say that we are members and that we have a function. We believe the phrase <em>individually members one of another,</em> but we doubt the phrase <em>members...have...function.</em> Every saint can say Amen to the fact that every saved person is a member of the Body of Christ. We can all declare affirmatively that we are members of the Body of Christ. At the closing of a letter many Chinese-speaking saints like to refer to themselves as &ldquo;the least member.&rdquo; Some refer to themselves as &ldquo;a weak member&rdquo;; others more humbly refer to themselves as &ldquo;an insignificant member.&rdquo; Whether we refer to ourselves as the least member, a weak member, or an insignificant member, we acknowledge that we are members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Even though God&rsquo;s Word says that every member has a function, we say that we are useless. We acknowledge that we are members of the Body, but we do not acknowledge that we have a function. This shows that although we believe God&rsquo;s Word, we also doubt it. When God says that we are members, we believe Him and acknowledge His Word, but when He says that we have a function, we have doubts.</p>
<p>Do we believe in our feelings and our condition or in God&rsquo;s Word? We should believe in His words, because there is reality behind every word of God: God &ldquo;spoke, and it was; / He commanded, and it stood&rdquo; (Psa. 33:9). God said, &ldquo;Let there be light; and there was light&rdquo; (Gen. 1:3). God Himself is the supporting basis of His word. There is truth and reality in every word of God. If God says that every member has a function, He will surely make His word real. He will work until every member&rsquo;s function is manifested. Hence, we must believe in God&rsquo;s words.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MANIFESTING FUNCTIONS AND<br />
BEING JOINED AND BUILT UP TOGETHER</h2>
<p>In terms of our condition, many of us do not function. If we all functioned, many new believers would be added to the church, and the condition of the church would improve. In reality, however, there are not many new believers in the church, and not many of those who are baptized can be sustained. These situations indicate that we are in oldness; we are not fresh, and we are not growing. They also indicate that we do not function adequately.</p>
<p>How can God&rsquo;s Word say that every member has a function, and yet we do not function? Some believers might say that we do not love the Lord enough, we are not spiritual enough, or we do not pray enough, and as a result, there is no manifestation of our functions. On the one hand, this statement is true, but on the other hand, we need to be delivered to see that it is not that hard to manifest our function. The simple way to manifest our function is to be built up.</p>
<p>Romans 12:4 says, &ldquo;Just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function.&rdquo; This means that every member has a function and that the functions of the different members are not the same. The next verse says, &ldquo;So we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another&rdquo; (v. 5). Here <em>function</em> and <em>individually members one of another</em> indicate that the manifestation of function depends on the mutual joining of the members. The manifestation of our function in the church does not depend on whether we love the Lord, on how spiritual we are, or on how much we pray; rather, it depends on whether we are joined together with all the members. When we are joined together with all the members, we will surely love the Lord, be spiritual, and pray. However, loving the Lord, being spiritual, and praying do not guarantee that we can be joined together with all the members. Hence, the manifestation of our function does not depend on our loving the Lord, our spirituality, or our praying but on our being joined together with all the members.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>individually members one of another</em> means to be built up. Only when we are built up can we be fitly joined and firmly knit together. Joining together is the state of being built up. Our physical body is an example. In order for a member of our body to function, it must be fitly joined together with the other members in our body. For example, a hand is useful in a body, but it immediately becomes useless if it is cut off and put aside. Even an arm that is out of joint, not being fitly joined with other members, will not manifest its function. Therefore, the primary condition for a member to manifest its function is to be fitly joined together with other members in the Body. This joining is the building up.</p>
<p>Some saints say that they are of little use because they do not have any gifts. But I would like to point out that, on the one hand, some believers have the gift of giving messages and of fellowshipping with others, but they do not have much function in the church, because they are not built up by being joined and knit together with the saints. On the other hand, some believers do not have the gift of giving messages, and their fellowship is confusing, but they have much function in the church because through them people are gathered together. Some people are very good at giving messages, but their speaking scatters people. The more they speak, the more people are scattered. This shows that building is a matter of function.</p>
<p>We often feel that we do not function because we are not spiritual enough. However, we have seen many spiritual people who lived before the Lord but did not have much function. Such a person can be compared to a fruitless branch. The longer he remains in a place, the drier and colder the place becomes. On the contrary, another person may not seem to be spiritual, but the longer he stays in a place, the more there is an atmosphere of the life and warmth of spring.</p>
<p>Some believers think that they are of little use because they are short of Bible knowledge, have little understanding of the truth, and have insufficient spiritual light. However, I have seen people who speak from the Old Testament and the New Testament with much light, have a clear knowledge of spiritual principles, and understand the truth, but when they speak, people&rsquo;s hearts become cold, and the people are scattered. There are also brothers who seem unclear concerning the light of the truth and concerning spiritual principles, and they lack a thorough knowledge of the Bible, but when they speak even a few words in a meeting, people are drawn closer together. The people whom these brothers contact are gathered together, stirred up, and become burning within.</p>
<p>In the same principle, I have seen many people who pray much but to little avail. Some even fast and pray for the church where they serve, but the more they fast and pray, the colder the condition of the church becomes. It seems as if God does not hear their prayer. There are also those who do not pray that much, but they have a drawing force that brings people closer together and a burning power that makes others burning.</p>
<p>Hence, all spiritual matters should be measured by the building. Our spirituality is abnormal if it cannot be measured by the building. There is a problem with the light we have received if it cannot be measured by the building. Our prayers will not be answered by God if they cannot pass the test of the building. Even the matter of being broken needs to be measured by the building. We all need to see this. It is not easy to be broken. Some believers seem to be broken, but others fear them and dare not to touch them. This is not breaking. Others do not advertise that they are broken, but they are able to perfect other saints and to serve the Lord and live for Him.</p>
<p>Hence, gifts, spirituality, knowledge, light, prayer, and brokenness do not cause us to manifest our function. Some believers do not seem to be gifted or spiritual, they do not have much light or knowledge, nor do they pray much or pay much attention to being broken, but their function before the Lord is manifested. This is the result of being fitly joined and firmly knit together with others.</p>
<p>Being fitly joined is a great test to every one of us. Can a very spiritual brother be joined to another brother who is not so spiritual? This is an effective test. A brother who cannot be joined together with others thinks too highly of himself. He thinks that their gifts are not as great as his, that the light they have cannot compare to his, and that they cannot fast or pray as he does. He cannot be joined together with others, because he feels that they cannot properly match him.</p>
<p>Some saints pray too much and therefore cannot be joined together with others. Even though they pray often, they pray in an individualistic way. A sister who prays individualistically might say, &ldquo;Those who do not pray much know only how to be busy in the outer court; they do not know how to draw near to God in the Holy of Holies. I cannot be with them. I want to serve God in the Holy of Holies; I will not serve with them in the outer court.&rdquo; Such a sister cannot be joined with others simply because she prays too much.</p>
<p>Some brothers are so &ldquo;broken&rdquo; that they cannot be joined together with others. Christians should not be peculiar. They should be balanced, and this balancing is for building up. A gift that cannot pass the test of being built up with others is a problem; spirituality that cannot be measured by the building is also abnormal; and light and knowledge that cannot pass the test of being measured by the building are also problems. A person who cannot pass the test of being built up is not broken; rather, his brokenness makes him stubborn.</p>
<p>Many so-called gifted persons in the church cannot be joined together with others. The so-called spiritual persons appreciate and admire only themselves. The so-called enlightened and knowledgeable persons ignore others. These believers cannot attain to the building up that God desires. Some people feel that only the apostle Paul is qualified to talk with them. They think that it is pointless and meaningless to speak about the Bible or the truth with the ushers or the saints who clean the meeting hall. Other believers feel that they can pray like Moses on Mount Sinai and that they are better than Aaron, Hur, Peter, James, and John. They compare themselves to the Lord Jesus at Gethsemane. They pray much, but they pray by themselves without companions. Other believers seem to be broken, but they are aloof and isolated. Instead of praying in the meetings, they criticize others for being fleshly and emotional. They consider only their prayer to be spiritual and broken. Because they are not joined or knit together with others, they are unable to manifest their function in the church.</p>
<p>The first condition for manifesting our function is to be joined and knit together with others. Some believers can coordinate with anyone. They are gifted, but they can be fitly joined with an insignificant brother. They know the Lord and are spiritual, but they can be fit together with those who are fleshly. They have received much light and pray much, but they can be joined together with foolish ones who do not know how to pray. In other words, they can be built up with any person. Such believers are useful and manifest the greatest function.</p>
<p>The ones with the greatest function in the church can be joined with others. It does not matter whether others are spiritual or fleshly, know how to pray, have received light, or understand the Bible; those who are useful can be joined together with anyone.</p>
<p>The only reason our function is limited in the Body of Christ is because we are not joined together with other members. The manifesting of function is strong proof that one is built up with others. When saints come together to serve the Lord, their hearts are full of joy, thanks, and praises, and they have love feasts and fellowship frequently. They have a fresh and sweet taste. With time, however, it is easy to have conflicts. This can be likened to a newly-wed couple who enjoy a short time of sweetness before a sour and bitter taste enters their marriage. Conflicts cause people to scatter and prevent their functions from being manifested. Some people are quiet; they seldom talk. They do not get involved or get into trouble, but they also are not built up with others. Those who cause trouble do not manifest their functions, nor do those who do not get involved. As a result, the church meetings become cold and desolate, and the fresh and sweet taste disappears.</p>
<p>Hence, in order for us to function, we need to be built up together with others. We need to be built up with the elders and the district responsible ones, as well as with the saints we are shepherding. We need to be built up with every saint. Those who are fitly joined, built up, with others have the greatest function. May the Lord open our eyes to see that the key to being a Christian is to be built up. Being built up depends on our being joined together with others.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
