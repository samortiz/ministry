GREAT IN ITS EXTENT</h2><h2 class="head2">A. To Make Us<br />Partners of God&rsquo;s Appointed Heir</h2><p>This &ldquo;so great a salvation&rdquo; is so great in its extent that it even makes us partners of God&rsquo;s appointed Heir (1:2, 9). Since we have covered this adequately in message five, we do not need to repeat it here.</p><h2 class="head2">B. To Bring Us into Glory</h2><p>This great salvation will bring us into glory (2:10). As we have pointed out on other occasions, glory is God manifested. We, the sons of God, will be brought into that manifestation of glory (Rom. 8:19-21). That will be the climax of the salvation which we share in Christ. So it certainly is a main factor that makes our salvation &ldquo;so great.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">C. To Make Us to Possess<br />the Coming Inhabited Earth with Christ</h2><p>This great salvation will make us to possess the coming inhabited earth with Christ (2:5). We do not need to run in an election to be mayor, senator, governor, or president. We shall inherit the coming inhabited earth. This is not a dream. The Bible tells us so. You can declare, &ldquo;I am going to inherit the earth. This I know, for the Bible tells me so.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">D. To Save Us to the Uttermost</h2><p>In this great salvation we shall be saved to the uttermost (7:25). This salvation is unlimited, saving us completely, entirely, perfectly for all time and to the end. This is the extent of our &ldquo;so great a salvation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So great a salvation&rdquo; is great in what Christ is, in what Christ does, and in its extent. Its most precious part is enjoying Christ as our saving life and rest in this age, and its most glorious part is inheriting Christ&rsquo;s kingdom with glory in the coming age.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. WARNING</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Give Heed to It More Abundantly</h2><p>Verse 2:1 says that &ldquo;we ought to give heed more abundantly to the things which were heard.&rdquo; You have heard much in these messages and you must give heed to what you have heard. You cannot be discharged of your responsibility and say that you have not heard or seen.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Do Not Drift Away from It</h2><p>Why must we give heed more abundantly to that which we have heard? Because &ldquo;lest at any time we drift away.&rdquo; Give heed that you do not drift away from what you have heard. Do not be a piece of driftwood that has no goal or direction and that merely drifts with the current. In order for there to be a drifting away, there must be a current. There was a current in Judaism for the Hebrew believers. There is now a current in the world and even in Christianity. There are many negative currents today. Be careful or else you will drift away from &ldquo;so great a salvation.&rdquo; Do not drift away&mdash;cross the river.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Do Not Neglect It</h2><p>Furthermore, we should not neglect &ldquo;so great a salvation&rdquo; (2:3). If we neglect it, we will receive a just recompense regarding it (2:2). We will suffer a loss (1 Cor. 3:15). This does not mean, however, that we will be lost. Nevertheless, we may receive a just recompense due to our negligence. That would be a great loss. I hope that none of us will fall into this category. Let us all cross the river and go on with our Captain of salvation into glory.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Hebrews &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
