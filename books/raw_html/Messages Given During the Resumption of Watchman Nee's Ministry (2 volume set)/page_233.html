<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WELCOMING JESUS&#151;RECEIVING THE SAVIOR<br>AS THE DYNAMIC SALVATION</H2><P>This man wanted to see Jesus. In the end he was seen by Jesus. Right after he was seen by Jesus, he received Him. In order to believe in the Lord, the first thing we have to do is to see the Lord, and the second thing we have to do is to receive Him. Jesus wants to live in your heart. If you come to see Him, and if you receive Him, He will come and live in your heart.</P><P>Zaccheus was saved, and he had a great change. Formerly he would not sacrifice even one hair for others, and he was an extortioner. Now he gave half of his possessions to the poor, and he gave back four times as much to those from whom he had taken away something by false accusations. Jesus is the Savior. When He comes into you, you will be saved, and you will be delivered from your sins. If you do not have the Lord Jesus yet, you need to be saved today. The Lord Jesus can deliver you from your sins.</P><P>Everyone knows that money is good. Even those who do not have money know that money is good. But those who have money can tell you that money can eat you up. If you have five gold bars at home, they will take away your sleep. Some people hang themselves just because they have lost one out of five gold bars. If you seek after education, education may end up hurting you; you may contract tuberculosis while you are seeking after education. If you pursue marriage, marriage may end up hurting you. Whatever you seek after and whatever you gain will eventually put you in bondage and will even harm you.</P><P>But today Jesus is here. When Jesus comes, we will be delivered from everything. I became a Christian at the age of twenty. Once I believed in Him, it was like my whole being was uplifted to the clouds. Jesus will give you the power to be unshackled from all that you could not be unshackled from. Once Jesus comes in, all the burdens go away.</P><P>Now we would ask all the friends who would like to believe in the Lord to stand up.</P>
