The first is the personal aspect and the second is the corporate aspect. In the Old Testament, the light in the temple was not a common kind of light. It was the light of the lampstand, which was not supposed to go out at any time. The light of the lampstand typifies Christ Himself. In the Old Testament all personal light was temporary in nature; it passed away after a while. But the light in the temple was shining all the time. Our meeting today is the temple, and in this temple there is the need for permanent light. The Bible is full of allusions to the temple as a type of the meeting of the saints. Ephesians 2 says that the church is the dwelling place of God in spirit. First Corinthians 3 says that we are the temple of God and the Holy Spirit dwells in us. Every time the saints gather together there is a spiritual house, and everyone is a stone built up as a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). Today when the saints are gathered together, they become the temple. Therefore, when we come together, we should expect a light that we would not ordinarily receive. It is hard for an individual to see any light. But when he comes together with others and they become a temple, the light comes. The church today is like the temple; it is the place where God shines His light in an intensified way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD PERSONALLY APPEARING TO PAUL</h2><p>Question: Why did God personally appear to Paul in Acts 9?</p><p>Answer: Pentecost did not fully consummate until Acts 10. Prior to chapter ten, Pentecost had come to the Jews, but it had not come to the house of Cornelius. Paul had the Damascus experience because the church had not fully come into existence yet. Before the church fully came into existence, Paul could not have accepted anything unless it was through God's direct appearing. God saved him, but He could not use him as an individual. Paul had contacted many church members and had persecuted them by putting those who called on the Lord in every place in chains. This is why God had to shine His light on him. Today God uses ordinary means, not supernatural means, to accomplish His works. He appeared to Paul in an extraordinary way because He needed to subdue him and bring him into submission. In spite of this, He told him to enter into the city, and that someone in the city would find him and tell him what he should do (9:6). The Lord sent Ananias to tell him two things. First, Paul was told to rise up and be baptized, washing away his sins (22:16). Second, Paul was told that God had called him to be a witness among the Gentiles, bearing His name (9:15). When Paul obeyed, he received his salvation. In the New Testament, the normal way is to receive the gospel from men, but Paul received his salvation directly from the Lord. As a consequence, when he wrote the book of Galatians, he proclaimed that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him (1:16). This is the revelation of the New Testament. This revealing could have happened at the time Ananias was talking to him. In any case, Paul had the experience on the way to Damascus in Acts 9 because the New Testament church was not yet fully formed at that time and the baptism of the Holy Spirit was not fully consummated.</p><h2 class="head1">SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE</h2><p>Question: How do you explain Peter's word that younger men should be subject to the elders?</p><p>Answer: Peter said in his first Epistle that younger men should be subject to the elders, and that we all should gird ourselves with humility toward one another (5:5). Peter did not say that the younger should obey the elders, but that the younger should be subject, or should submit, to the elders. Obedience is a matter of conduct, whereas submission is a matter of attitude. We can only obey the Lord, yet we should submit to one another. Submission is a question of the heart, whereas obedience is a question of conduct and action. We often obey a person without submitting to him. Submission is being one with others in attitude. It is to not oppose. Today we find many wives who would obey, but few who would submit. Many women do what a wife is supposed to do, but they murmur quite a bit. This is obedience, but this is not submission. How many times has a wife obeyed out of submission?</p><p>One brother did not obey his father's order because the order contradicted his faith. He told his father, "I wish I could obey you. I wish I could do what you said and obey, but I cannot disobey God. Please forgive me." The son was gentle, yet he could not obey his father because his father's word contradicted his faith. Paul told the slaves to obey their masters, but he told the wives to submit to rather than obey their husbands (Eph. 6:5; 5:22). A woman can do many things, but she should be in subjection to her husband. Good citizens must be subject to those who are above them. Peter said, "Be subject to every human institution for the Lord's sake, whether to a king as being supreme..." (1 Pet. 2:13). Peter did not say to obey, but to be subject to or to submit. Submission is not opposing. Among the brothers, the younger should submit to the elders. If a matter is in harmony with God's will, we can do it, but we cannot do it if it is not in harmony with God's will. This is submission, not obedience. A meek spirit is a submissive spirit. If we can distinguish between submission and obedience, we will avoid many problems.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
