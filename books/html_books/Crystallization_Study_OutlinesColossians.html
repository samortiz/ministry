the Centrality and Universality of God&rsquo;s Economy</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:9, 15-18, 27; 2:8, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Christ unveiled in Colossians is the all-inclusive, extensive, preeminent One, the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;1:15-18, 27; 2:16-17; 3:4, 10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Colossians reveals the all-inclusive Christ&mdash;the One who is God, man, and the reality of every positive thing in the universe&mdash;2:9, 16-17.</li>
	<li>For Christ to be the Firstborn of both the original creation and the new creation means that He is both all-inclusive and extensive&mdash;1:15, 18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The extensive Christ is the Christ who is more vast than the universe and who is everything to us&mdash;Eph. 3:18.</li>
		<li>Christ, the Savior in whom we believe, is limitless and inexhaustible; since He is without limitation, the revelation concerning Him must also be without limitation&mdash;vv. 2-5, 8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ is the preeminent One, the One who has the first place in everything&mdash;Col. 1:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Both in the old creation and the new creation, both in the universe and in the church, Christ occupies the first place, the place of preeminence&mdash;vv. 15, 18.</li>
		<li>If we have a vision of the preeminence of Christ, our living and our church life will be revolutionized, for we will realize that in all things Christ must have the first place&mdash;cf. Rev. 2:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ is the centrality and universality, the center and circumference, of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Col. 1:15-27; Eph. 1:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In God&rsquo;s economy Christ is everything; God wants Christ and Christ alone&mdash;the wonderful, preeminent, all-inclusive Christ, who is all and in all&mdash;Matt. 17:5; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s economy; God&rsquo;s dispensing is altogether related to Christ and focused on Him&mdash;Eph. 3:17a.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is to work the wonderful, all-inclusive, extensive Christ into our being as our life and our everything that we may become the corporate expression of the Triune God&mdash;Col. 1:27; 3:4, 10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The will of God is that the all-inclusive, extensive Christ be our portion&mdash;1:9, 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In 1:9 God&rsquo;s will refers to Christ; the will of God is profound in relation to our knowing, experiencing, and living the all-inclusive, extensive Christ.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s will is that we know Christ, experience Christ, enjoy Christ, be saturated with Christ, and have Christ become our life and person&mdash;3:4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ dwells in us as our hope of glory&mdash;1:27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We worship the enthroned Christ in the heavens, but we experience, enjoy, and partake of the indwelling Christ in our spirit; we are one with Him in a very subjective way&mdash;3:1; 1:27; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>The Christ who indwells us is not a small, limited Christ but the all-inclusive, extensive Christ&mdash;the One who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation, the Head of the Body, and the embodiment of the fullness of God&mdash;Col. 1:15-16, 18-19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ is our life&mdash;3:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The expression <em>our life</em> is a strong indication that we are to experience the all-inclusive Christ, the One who is the reality of every positive thing&mdash;2:16-17.</li>
	<li>The extensive Christ has become our life; universally, He is extensive, but in our personal experience, He is our life, our being.</li>
	<li>Because Christ is our life, all He has and all He has attained and obtained become subjective to us&mdash;Rom. 8:34, 10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ is the unique constituent of the one new man&mdash;Col. 3:10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The content of the church as the new man is Christ alone; in the new man there is room only for Christ, for He is everyone and in everyone.</li>
	<li>In the church as the new man we are in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ, and we subsist together in Christ to be God&rsquo;s expression in Christ&mdash;1:16-17.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s ultimate goal in His economy is to gain the new man constituted with the all-inclusive, extensive Christ&mdash;Eph. 2:15; 4:24; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We should estimate and evaluate everything according to the all-inclusive, extensive Christ&mdash;2:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is the governing principle of all genuine wisdom and knowledge, the reality of all genuine teaching, and the only measure of all concepts acceptable to God.</li>
	<li>Only when we have a clear view of the place of the all-inclusive, extensive Christ in God&rsquo;s economy will we be able to see through delusion and deception.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to be infused, saturated, and permeated with the all-inclusive, extensive Christ until in our experience He is everything to us&mdash;1:27; 2:16-17; 3:4, 10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ is in us, but we need to see Him, know Him, be filled with Him, be saturated with Him, and be absolutely one with Him.</li>
	<li>We should allow the all-inclusive, extensive Christ to fill our whole being and to replace our culture with Himself&mdash;Eph. 3:17a; Col. 3:10-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The more Christ replaces our natural life and culture with Himself, the more we will be able to declare, &ldquo;To live is Christ&rdquo;; to us to live will be the Christ who takes full possession of us, occupies us, and fills us with Himself&mdash;Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ desires to replace every element of our natural life and culture with Himself so that we may be the one new man as His corporate expression; this is the message of the book of Colossians.</li>

<h1 class="title">Enjoying the All-inclusive Christ as the Good Land&mdash;Our Allotted Portion</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:12; 2:6-15, 19;<br />
Exo. 3:8; Deut. 8:8-9; 26:9</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Christ as the preeminent and all-inclusive One is the allotted portion of the saints&mdash;Col. 1:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The allotted portion refers to the lot of the inheritance, as illustrated by the allotment of the good land of Canaan given to the children of Israel for their inheritance&mdash;Josh. 14:1.</li>
	<li>The New Testament believers&rsquo; allotted portion is not a physical land; it is the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;Col. 2:6-7; Gal. 3:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The riches of the good land typify the unsearchable riches of Christ in different aspects as the bountiful supply to His believers in His Spirit&mdash;Deut. 8:7-10; Eph. 3:8; Phil. 1:19.</li>
		<li>By enjoying the riches of the land, the believers in Christ are built up to be His Body as the house of God and the kingdom of God&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 2:21-22; 1 Tim. 3:15; Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The purpose of God&rsquo;s calling is to bring God&rsquo;s chosen people into the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ, typified by the good land flowing with milk and honey&mdash;Exo. 3:8; cf. 1 Cor. 1:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Milk and honey, which are the mingling of both the animal life and the vegetable life, are two aspects of the life of Christ&mdash;the redeeming aspect and the generating aspect&mdash;Deut. 8:8; 26:9; cf. John 1:29; 12:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The redeeming aspect of Christ&rsquo;s life is for our judicial redemption, and the generating aspect of Christ&rsquo;s life is for our organic salvation&mdash;1:29; 12:24; Rev. 2:7; Rom. 5:10.</li>
		<li>The symbols of the Lord&rsquo;s table signify the redeeming and generating aspects of Christ&rsquo;s life for God&rsquo;s complete salvation; thus, the good land has become a table, a feast for our enjoyment&mdash;Matt. 26:26-28; 1 Cor. 10:16-17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must be <em>in the light</em> in order to enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the good land in His redeeming and generating aspects&mdash;Col. 1:12; 1 Pet. 2:9; Isa. 2:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God is light&mdash;1 John 1:5.</li>
		<li>The word of God is light&mdash;Psa. 119:105, 130.</li>

		<li>The church is a lampstand shining with light&mdash;Rev. 1:20; Psa. 73:16-17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must eat God&rsquo;s words to enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the good land in His redeeming and generating aspects; God&rsquo;s word is milk for us to drink and honey for us to eat&mdash;John 6:57, 63, 68; 1 Pet. 2:2; Psa. 119:103; Ezek. 3:3.</li>
	<li>By enjoying Christ as the land of milk and honey, we will be constituted with Him as milk and honey&mdash;&ldquo;Your lips drip fresh honey, my bride; / Honey and milk are under your tongue&rdquo;&mdash;S. S. 4:11a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Honey restores the stricken ones, whereas milk feeds the new ones.</li>
		<li>The seeker has stored so many riches within her that food is under her tongue, and she can dispense the riches of Christ to the needy ones at any time&mdash;Isa. 50:4; Luke 4:22; Eph. 4:29-30; cf. Matt. 12:35-36.</li>
		<li>This sweetness is not produced overnight, but comes from a long period of gathering, inward activity, and careful storage&mdash;S. S. 4:16; 2 Cor. 12:7-9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We can walk in Christ as our living land and absorb Christ as our rich soil, in which we have been rooted, so that we may grow with the elements that we absorb from the soil&mdash;Col. 2:6-7; cf. 1 Cor. 3:6, 9; Col. 2:19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Colossians 2:8-15 presents a full description and definition of Christ as the soil, in which we do not lack anything; as we take time to absorb Him as the all-inclusive land, the facts in these verses become our experience:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ as the soil is the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily&mdash;v. 9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li><em>Fullness</em> refers not to the riches of God but to the expression of the riches of God; what dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead but the expression of the riches of what God is&mdash;v. 9; 1:15, 19; 3:10-11.</li>
			<li>When we are rooted in Christ as the soil, we are made full in Him; we are filled up with all the divine riches to become His expression&mdash;Eph. 3:8, 17, 19.</li>
			<li>In Christ as the soil we are filled, completed, perfected, satisfied, and thoroughly supplied; we do not lack anything&mdash;cf. Phil. 1:19.</li>
			<li>Christ as the soil is the history and mystery of God with all the riches of His person and processes&mdash;Col. 2:2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ as the soil is the Head of all rule and authority&mdash;v. 10.</li>

		<li>In Christ as the soil there is an element which causes us to be buried&mdash;v. 12a.</li>
		<li>In Christ as the soil there is an element which causes us to be raised up&mdash;v. 12b.</li>
		<li>In Christ as the soil there is an element which vivifies us&mdash;v. 13.</li>
		<li>In Christ as the soil there is the wiping out of the handwriting in ordinances&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		<li>In Christ as the soil there is the victory over the evil spirits in the atmosphere&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must take time to enjoy the Lord as the all-inclusive land so that all the elements of Christ as the rich soil may be absorbed into us for us to be made full in Him in our experience&mdash;v. 10a; 4:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we would absorb the riches of Christ as the soil, we need to have tender, new roots&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
		<li>We need to forget our situation, our condition, our failures, and our weaknesses and simply take time to absorb the Lord; as we take time to absorb Him, we grow with the growth of God in us for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Matt. 14:22-23; 6:6; Col. 2:7a, 19b; cf. Luke 8:13.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The kingdom of God is the ruling, the reigning, of God with all its blessing and enjoyment&mdash;Mark 1:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The kingdom of God is God&rsquo;s reign in a general way from eternity past to eternity future and also God&rsquo;s reign in a particular way in the sense of life&mdash;Heb. 1:8; Psa. 145:13; Dan. 4:3; John 3:3, 5, 15.</li>
	<li>The kingdom of God is God Himself, and God Himself is life and everything as the content of the kingdom of God&mdash;Mark 1:15; cf. Eph. 4:18.</li>
	<li>The kingdom of God is the Savior, the Lord Jesus, as the seed of life sown into His believers and developing into a realm over which God can rule as His kingdom in His divine life&mdash;Luke 17:20-21; Mark 4:3, 26:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The entrance into the kingdom is regeneration, and the development of the kingdom is the believers&rsquo; growth in the divine life&mdash;John 3:5; 2 Pet. 1:3-11.</li>
		<li>The kingdom is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live&mdash;Rom. 14:17.</li>
		<li>The kingdom of God will develop into the coming kingdom as a reward to be inherited by the overcoming saints in the millennium&mdash;Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5; Rev. 20:4, 6.</li>

	<li>The kingdom is the shining of the reality of the Lord Jesus; to be under His shining is to be in the kingdom&mdash;Mark 9:1-2.</li>
	<li>The kingdom of God as the reign of God is a realm not only of the divine dominion but also of the divine species, in which are all the divine things&mdash;John 3:3, 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In John 3 the kingdom of God refers more to the species of God than to the reign of God.</li>
		<li>God became man to enter into the human species, and man becomes God in life and nature but not in the Godhead to enter into the divine species&mdash;1:12-14; Rom. 8:3; 1:3-4.</li>
		<li>To enter into the divine realm, the realm of the divine species, we need to be born of God to have the divine life and nature&mdash;John 1:12-13:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We were regenerated of God to be the species of God and enter into the kingdom of God&mdash;3:3, 5.</li>
			<li>Our second birth caused us to enter into the kingdom of God to become the species of God; now we are God-men in the divine species, that is, in the kingdom of God.</li>

<li>The Father delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love&mdash;Col. 1:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The authority of darkness denotes the authority of Satan&mdash;Acts 26:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Darkness is Satan as death; thus, to be delivered out of the authority of darkness is to be delivered from the devil, who has the might of death&mdash;Heb. 2:14; John 17:15.</li>
		<li>We have been delivered from the devil, Satan, by the death of Christ and by the life of Christ in resurrection&mdash;Col. 1:13; 2:14-15; John 5:24.</li>
		<li>In Colossians the authority of darkness refers to the good aspects of culture and of our character, disposition, and natural being.</li>
		<li>Whenever we are in the natural man or live in the self, we are under the control of the authority of darkness; the only thing we can do is go to the cross and allow the cross to deal with every aspect of the satanic authority of darkness&mdash;Matt. 16:24; Col. 3:5-9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The kingdom of the Son is the authority of Christ&mdash;Rev. 11:15; 12:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Son of God is the embodiment and expression of the divine life; hence, the kingdom of the Son is a realm of life&mdash;1 John 5:11-12; John 1:4.</li>
		<li>The kingdom into which we have been transferred is the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love; this realm of life is in love, not in fear&mdash;Col. 1:13.</li>
		<li>The kingdom in which we find ourselves today is a realm full of life, light, and love&mdash;1 Pet. 2:9.</li>

			<li>The Son, as the embodiment of the divine life, is the object of the Father&rsquo;s love&mdash;17:5:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The divine life embodied in the Son is given to us in the divine love.</li>
				<li>2) The object of the divine love becomes to us the embodiment of life in the divine love with the authority in resurrection; this is the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love.</li>
				</ol></li>

			<li>The Son in resurrection is now the life-giving Spirit, and He rules us in His resurrection life with love&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 6:4-5; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>

		<li>Although the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love comprises the present age, the coming age, and the eternal age, the emphasis in Colossians 1:13 is on the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love in this age, the age of the church:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">

<h1 class="title">The Stewardship of God<br />
to Complete the Word of God<br />
and to Present Every Man Full-grown in Christ</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:24&mdash;2:2</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>We need to follow the pattern of Paul to be a faithful minister of the church according to the stewardship of God&mdash;1 Tim. 1:16; Col. 1:24-25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The desire of God&rsquo;s heart is to dispense Himself into man; this is the central point of the whole Bible&mdash;Gen. 2:7-9; John 10:10b; Eph. 3:8-11.</li>
	<li>Because our Father has a great family, a divine household, and such vast riches, there is the need in His household for many stewards to dispense these riches to His children; this dispensing is the stewardship&mdash;v. 2; 1 Cor. 9:17.</li>
	<li>A steward is a household administrator, a dispenser, one who dispenses the household supply to its members; the apostles were appointed by the Lord to be such stewards, dispensing God&rsquo;s mysteries, which are Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ, to the believers&mdash;Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4; 1 Cor. 4:1.</li>
	<li>In this dispensing ministry it is most important that stewards be found faithful; as faithful stewards, we need to learn not to care about being criticized by others and not to criticize or examine ourselves&mdash;vv. 1-5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>For the sake of His Body, which is the church, the faithful stewards of God fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ&mdash;Col. 1:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The afflictions of Christ are of two categories: those for accomplishing redemption, which were completed by Christ Himself, and those for producing and building the church, which need to be filled up by the apostles and the believers&mdash;John 12:24-26; Luke 12:50; Mark 10:38-39; Phil. 3:10; Isa. 53:3-5; Rev. 1:9; 2 Tim. 2:10; 2 Cor. 1:5-6.</li>
	<li>The fact that Paul mentions the afflictions of Christ in connection with the stewardship of God indicates that the stewardship can be carried out only through suffering&mdash;1 Pet. 4:1, 10; 2 Cor. 6:8; cf. Psa. 91:1-2; 31:20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The faithful stewards of God labor and struggle to complete the word of God&mdash;Col. 1:25; Acts 20:26-27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the New Testament the apostles, especially the apostle Paul, completed the word of God in the mystery of God, which is Christ, and in the mystery of Christ, which is the church, to give us a full revelation of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Eph. 5:32; Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4.</li>
	<li>The mystery concerning Christ and the church was hidden from eternity and from all the times until the New Testament age, when it is being manifested to the saints, including all of us, the believers in Christ&mdash;Col. 1:26.</li>
	<li>We need to fulfill our responsibility to complete the word of God in the sense of fully preaching the word, declaring all the counsel of God; this means that as we contact people, we must progressively, continually, and gradually preach the word of God in full&mdash;Acts 20:26-27.</li>
	<li>The goal of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the completion of the word of God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we would be those who complete the word of God, we must minister Christ as the life-giving Spirit and stand with the church as the living expression of Christ on the proper ground of locality; this is our burden, our ministry, and our warfare.</li>
		<li>Without the completion of the word of God, God&rsquo;s purpose cannot be fulfilled, and Christ cannot obtain His bride or come with His kingdom.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The goal of Paul&rsquo;s ministry was to present every man full-grown in Christ&mdash;Col. 1:28-29:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul announced the indwelling Christ in all wisdom for every man&rsquo;s full growth in Christ&mdash;Acts 20:20, 31; Col. 2:2-3; cf. 2 Chron. 1:10.</li>
	<li>Paul labored and struggled according to Christ&rsquo;s operation within him in power, the power of the resurrection life&mdash;Phil. 3:10; Eph. 1:19; 3:7, 20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In order to present every man full-grown in Christ, we must minister Christ to them as the portion of the saints, the reality of the good land, the all-inclusive One who is the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Col. 1:12, 15, 18-19, 27; 2:3, 9, 16-17; 3:4, 11.</li>
		<li>In order to present every man full-grown in Christ, we must minister the unsearchable riches of Christ for the building up of the church to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;Eph. 3:8-11.</li>
		<li>In order to present every man full-grown in Christ, we must complete the word of God with the full revelation of Christ and the church&mdash;Col. 1:25-28.</li>
		<li>In order to present every man full-grown in Christ, we must minister Christ as the mystery of God, that is, as the embodiment of God&mdash;2:2, 9.</li>
		<li>In order to present every man full-grown in Christ, we must minister the church as the mystery of Christ, the expression of Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:4; 1:23.</li>
		<li>In order to present every man full-grown in Christ, we must minister Christ as life to His members so that they may live by Him and grow with Him unto maturity&mdash;Col. 3:4; John 6:57; 14:19; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 4:13, 15.</li>
		<li>In order to present every man full-grown in Christ, we must be concerned about the condition of their hearts&mdash;Col. 2:1-2:

			<li>If the hearts of the Colossians were comforted and knit together in love, the result would be all the riches of the full assurance of understanding concerning Christ as the mystery of God.</li>
			<li>It is only after their hearts have been comforted, cherished, that the saints can receive the revelation concerning Christ; we must look to the Lord for the grace to comfort all the distracted, dissatisfied, and disappointed hearts&mdash;Eph. 5:29; cf. Isa. 61:1-2.</li>
			<li>If we would have all the riches of the full assurance of understanding concerning Christ as the mystery of God, every part of our being must be exercised&mdash;Col. 2:2; 1 Tim. 4:7b:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Due to our lack of exercise, we may not have the full assurance of understanding concerning the recovery, the kind of assurance that martyrs have when they lay down their lives for the Lord&mdash;Acts 1:8.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The all-inclusive Christ who indwells us is the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Col. 1:26-27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is like a great wheel, having Christ as its every part&mdash;He is the hub (the center), the spokes (the support), and the rim (the circumference) of the divine economy&mdash;Ezek. 1:15; Col. 1:17b, 18b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is to work Christ Himself into His chosen people so that Christ may be all and in all&mdash;3:10-11; Gal. 1:16a; 2:20; 4:19.</li>
		<li>Christ is the mystery, the secret, the crucial focus, of the divine economy; this means that the secret of the dispensing of the Triune God into God&rsquo;s chosen people is Christ Himself&mdash;Col. 1:25-28, 17b, 18b; 2:9.</li>
		<li>Christ is the Head of the Body (1:18) and the Body of the Head (1 Cor. 12:12); He is all the members and in all the members of the new man (Col. 3:10-11).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The mystery hidden from the ages and from the generations has been made manifest to the saints; this mystery is the all-inclusive Christ as the indwelling hope of glory&mdash;1:26-27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The hope of our calling (Eph. 1:18b; 4:4b) is the hope of glory, which is the transfiguration of our body and the manifestation of the sons of God (Rom. 8:19, 23-25, 30; Phil. 3:21).</li>
		<li>The Christ who dwells within us is the mystery full of glory, with countless riches; we are being strengthened into our inner man according to the riches of God&rsquo;s glory, which are wrought into us for our beautification and return to God with us for His glorification&mdash;Eph. 3:16-21.</li>
		<li>Christ as the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy is indwelling us as the hope of glory to be wrought into us day by day for our transformation from glory to glory unto the full expression of God&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; Rev. 21:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Christ is the mystery of God&mdash;Col. 2:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the mystery of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the history of God; the whole &ldquo;story&rdquo; of God is in Christ and is Christ&mdash;John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rev. 4:5.</li>
	<li>As the mystery of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the definition, explanation, and expression of God&mdash;the Word of God; in Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge&mdash;John 1:1; Rev. 19:13; Col. 2:2-3.</li>
	<li>As the mystery of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the Firstborn of all creation&mdash;Col. 1:15; John 1:14; Isa. 9:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ as God is the Creator (Heb. 1:10); however, as man, sharing the created blood and flesh (2:14a), He is part of the creation.</li>
		<li>Before the foundation of the world, even before anything was created, God had foreordained that Christ become a created man in order to accomplish His purpose; hence, in God&rsquo;s plan and in His eternal view, Christ is the first one created&mdash;He is the Firstborn of all creation, the Head of all the created ones&mdash;Col. 1:15; Micah 5:2; 1 Pet. 1:20; Rev. 13:8.</li>
		<li>The creation was created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ&mdash;Col. 1:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>All things were created in Christ, in the power of His person; all creation bears the characteristics of His intrinsic power&mdash;Rom. 1:20.</li>
			<li>All things were created through Christ as the active instrument through which the creation of all things was accomplished in sequence&mdash;John 1:3; Heb. 11:3; Rom. 4:17.</li>
			<li>All things were created unto Christ as the end of all creation for His possession&mdash;cf. Acts 2:36.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ is before all things, and all things cohere in Him as the holding center and hub of the universe&mdash;Col. 1:17.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His creation is to use the things of creation to illustrate the all-inclusive Christ; the entire universe came into existence for the purpose of describing Him as the image of the invisible God&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the mystery of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the Firstborn from the dead&mdash;v. 18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the Son of God, Christ has passed through two births; the first birth was His incarnation for our judicial redemption, and the second birth was His resurrection for our organic salvation&mdash;John 1:14; Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29.</li>
		<li>As the eternally preexistent One, He is our Creator for our existence, as the Firstborn of all creation, He is our Redeemer for our redemption, and as the Firstborn from the dead, He is the life-giving Spirit for our deification&mdash;Heb. 2:10-11; cf. Rev. 22:1.</li>
		<li>Christ is the first in resurrection as the Head of the Body; as such, He has the first place in the church, God&rsquo;s new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.</li>
		<li>Christ fully expresses the Triune God because He is the Firstborn of both creations, the One through whom both the old creation and the new creation came into being; the full expression of the rich being of God, in both creation and the church, dwells in Christ&mdash;Col. 1:15, 18-19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the mystery of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the embodiment of God; from the time that Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in Him in a bodily way; and in His glorified body now and forever it dwells&mdash;2:9; Phil. 3:21; John 20:27-29.</li>
	<li>As the mystery of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit to be one spirit with us; as the life-giving Spirit mingled with our spirit, He is our life and our person&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17; Col. 3:4; Eph. 3:16-17.</li>
	<li>As the mystery of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the constituent of His Body, the church, which is the mystery of Christ; not only Christ Himself as the Head but also the church as the Body are the manifestation of God in the flesh, the great mystery of godliness&mdash;Col. 4:3; Eph. 3:3-4; 5:32; 1 Tim. 3:15-16a; 4:7b.</li>
	<li>As the mystery of God, the all-inclusive Christ has the first place in all things&mdash;in the old creation and the new creation (Col. 1:18b), in the Christian life and experience (Rev. 2:4; 2 Cor. 5:14-15; Gal. 2:20), and in the Christian work and messages (Eph. 2:10; 1 Cor. 2:2; 2 Cor. 4:5).</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In His economy God gives us one person and one way; the one person is the all-inclusive, extensive, preeminent Christ, and the one way is the cross&mdash;1 Cor. 2:2; Phil. 2:5-11; Gal. 6:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We not only have Christ, the unique person, who is versus all things; we also have the cross, the unique way, which is versus all ways&mdash;Col. 1:20.</li>
	<li>The way God has ordained, uplifted, and honored is the cross of Christ&mdash;Gal. 6:14.</li>
	<li>The one person&mdash;Christ&mdash;is the center of the universe, and the one way&mdash;the cross&mdash;is the center of God&rsquo;s government&mdash;1 Cor. 2:2; 1:17-18, 23; Gal. 6:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God governs everything by the cross and deals with everything by the cross&mdash;Col. 1:20; 2:14-15.</li>
		<li>By the cross God has dealt with all the negative things in the universe, and He is still governing everything through the cross&mdash;Eph. 2:14-16.</li>
		<li>In order to progress spiritually, we need to pass through the cross; until we come to the New Jerusalem, we need to pass through the cross day by day in our walk with the Lord&mdash;Matt. 10:38; 16:24; Luke 14:27.</li>
		<li>In order to have the proper church life, we need to experience the cross; if we have a daily life of passing through the cross, there will be oneness and harmony both in the church life and in the family life&mdash;Col. 3:12-15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we have a clear understanding of the fact that the enemy of God, in a subtle way, utilizes culture to replace Christ, we will realize that the only way for us to take is the way of the cross&mdash;Gal. 6:14; 1 Cor. 2:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The book of Colossians teaches us that in the church life Christ must be all and in all; everything that is not Christ must go to the cross&mdash;1:18; 3:10-11.</li>
	<li>Through the cross we need to become nothing, to have nothing, and to be able to do nothing; otherwise, what we are, what we have, and what we can do will become a substitute for Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:17-18, 23.</li>
	<li>For those who are willing to take the cross, the cross is not a narrow way but a highway&mdash;Luke 9:23.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the book of Colossians we see a clear vision of the cross as God&rsquo;s way in His administration&mdash;1:20-22; 2:11-15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross&mdash;through Him, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens&rdquo;&mdash;1:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Through Him</em> means through Christ as the active instrument through which the reconciliation was accomplished&mdash;v. 20a.</li>
		<li><em>All things</em> refers not only to human beings but also to all creatures, which were created in Christ and now subsist, cohere, in Him (vv. 16-17) and are reconciled to God through Him.</li>
		<li>To reconcile all things to Himself is to make peace with Himself for all things; this was accomplished through the blood of the cross of Christ.</li>
		<li>Because of the rebellion of Satan, the archangel, and the angels who followed him, the heavens were contaminated; therefore, not only things on the earth but also things in the heavens needed to be reconciled to God&mdash;v. 20b.</li>
		<li>Because we were sinners, we needed redemption, and because we were also enemies of God, we needed reconciliation&mdash;vv. 14, 21-22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross&rdquo;&mdash;2:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Ordinances</em> refers to the ordinances of the ceremonial law with its rituals, which are the forms or ways of living and worship&mdash;Eph. 2:15.</li>
		<li><em>Nailing it to the cross</em> means to abolish the law of the commandments in ordinances.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it&rdquo;&mdash;Col. 2:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This verse portrays the fighting that took place at the time of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion.</li>
		<li>Activities involving Christ, God, and the evil angelic rulers and authorities were brought to a focus on the cross; thus, the cross became God&rsquo;s eternal, central, and unique way&mdash;vv. 14-15.</li>
		<li>By His crucifixion Christ labored to accomplish redemption, and God the Father was working to judge sin and nail the law to the cross&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		<li>At the same time, the evil rulers and authorities were busy in their attempt to frustrate the work of God and Christ, pressing in close to God and Christ; thus, a warfare was raging at the cross.</li>
		<li>God openly made a display of the evil angelic rulers and authorities on the cross and triumphed over them in it, putting them to shame&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ&rdquo;&mdash;v. 11:

		<li>This is spiritual circumcision, the circumcision of Christ, referring to the proper baptism, which puts off the body of the flesh by the effectual virtue of the death of Christ&mdash;Phil. 3:3.</li>

John 14:6a, 17; 1 John 5:6; John 16:13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>&ldquo;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ. Let no one defraud you by judging you unworthy of your prize&rdquo;&mdash;Col. 2:16-18a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As with a man&rsquo;s physical body, the body in 2:17 is the substance, and like the shadow of a man&rsquo;s body, the rituals in the law are a shadow of Christ, who is the substance and reality of the gospel; Colossians unveils such an all-inclusive Christ as the focus of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;1:17a, 18a; 3:11.</li>
	<li>Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly Christ is the reality of every positive thing, implying the universal extensiveness of the all-inclusive Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Daily Christ is our food and drink for our satisfaction and strengthening&mdash;1 Cor. 10:3-4.</li>
		<li>Weekly Christ is our Sabbath for our completion and rest in Him&mdash;Matt. 11:28-29.</li>
		<li>Monthly Christ is our new moon as a new beginning with light in darkness&mdash;John 1:5; 8:12.</li>
		<li>Yearly Christ is our feast for our joy and enjoyment&mdash;1 Cor. 5:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The extensive Christ, who is full of attractiveness and rich in magnetism, is the essence of the Bible&mdash;Luke 24:44; John 5:39-40; Matt. 1:1; cf. Rev. 22:21.</li>
	<li>According to the context, the &ldquo;prize&rdquo; in Colossians 2:18 is the enjoyment of Christ as the body of the shadows; to be defrauded of our prize is to be defrauded of the subjective enjoyment of Christ&mdash;cf. Gen. 15:1; Phil. 3:8.</li>
	<li>Our need is for the subjective Christ to become our enjoyment to complete the divine revelation within us; if we are short in the experience and enjoyment of Christ, we are also short concerning God&rsquo;s revelation&mdash;Col. 1:25-28.</li>
	<li>Whatever we do day by day should remind us of Christ as the reality of that thing; if we follow the practice of taking Christ as the reality of all the material things in our daily life, our daily walk will be revolutionized and transformed and we will be full of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16; Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>
	<li>We need to enjoy Christ day by day as the reality of all our necessities:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is our breath&mdash;John 20:22.</li>
		<li>Christ is our drink&mdash;4:10, 14; 7:37-39a.</li>
		<li>Christ is our food&mdash;6:35, 57.</li>
		<li>Christ is our light&mdash;1:4; 8:12.</li>
		<li>Christ is our clothing&mdash;Gal. 3:27.</li>
		<li>Christ is our dwelling place&mdash;John 15:5, 7a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Christ is the reality of all the positive things in the universe&mdash;cf. Rom. 1:20; Eph. 3:18; <em>Hymns,</em> #496:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because the universe with the billions of things and persons in it was created for the purpose of describing Christ, He, in revealing Himself to His disciples, could easily find in any environment something or someone to serve as an illustration of Himself&mdash;Col. 1:15-17; John 1:51; 10:9-11; 12:24; Matt. 12:41-42.</li>
	<li>The Old Testament uses six major categories of things as types to describe Christ&mdash;human beings, animals, plants, minerals, offerings, and foods:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Human beings typify Christ, such as Adam (Rom. 5:14), Mechizedek (Heb. 7:1-3), Isaac (Matt. 1:1), Jonah (12:41), and Solomon (v. 42).</li>
		<li>Animals typify Christ, such as a lamb (John 1:29), a lion, an ox, an eagle (Ezek. 1:10), and a gazelle (S. S. 2:9).</li>
		<li>Plants typify Christ (who is the tree of life&mdash;Gen. 2:9), such as the vine tree (John 15:1), the apple tree (S. S. 2:3), the fig tree, the pomegranate tree, and the olive tree (Deut. 8:8); the different parts of a tree are also types of Christ, such as the root, the stump, the sprout, the shoot, the branch, and the fruit (Isa. 11:1, 10; 4:2; Luke 1:42; Rev. 5:5).</li>
		<li>Minerals typify Christ, such as gold, silver, copper, and iron (Deut. 8:9b, 13), and different kinds of stone: the living stone (1 Pet. 2:4), the rock (1 Cor. 10:4), the cornerstone (Matt. 21:42), the topstone (Zech. 4:7), the foundation stone, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:11-12).</li>
		<li>Offerings typify Christ, such as the sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, wave offering, heave offering, and drink offering&mdash;Lev. 1&mdash;7; Exo. 29:26-28; Num. 28:7-10; cf. John 4:24.</li>
		<li>Foods typify Christ, such as bread, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, wheat, barley, milk, and honey&mdash;6:35; Deut. 8:8-9a; 26:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the New Testament, Christ is the Spirit of reality who makes the untraceable riches of all that He is real to us, guiding us into Himself as the divine reality&mdash;John 14:6a; 1 John 5:6; John 14:17; 16:13.</li>
	<li>The elements of the reality of all the types are in the Spirit, and the Spirit transfuses and dispenses all these riches into us through the Lord&rsquo;s words&mdash;Phil. 1:19; John 6:63; Col. 3:16; Eph. 6:17-18; Rev. 2:7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The very Christ who is the reality of all positive things is the One who is the Head of the Body; thus, to hold the Head is simply to enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things&mdash;Col. 2:19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since the Christ we enjoy as our everything is the Head of the Body, the more we enjoy Him, the more we become Body-conscious:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ is not an individualistic matter, but a Body matter&mdash;cf. Eph. 3:8; 4:15-16.</li>
		<li>The more we enjoy Christ, the more we love the other members of the Body&mdash;Col. 1:4, 8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because Christ&rsquo;s headship is in resurrection (v. 18), the enjoyment of Christ spontaneously brings us into resurrection and saves us from our natural being.</li>
	<li>The enjoyment of Christ brings us into the heavenlies in ascension; we can be experientially in the heavens only by enjoying Christ, the Head, as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit&mdash;3:1-2; 2 Cor. 3:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:10, 34.</li>
	<li>As we enjoy Christ and hold Him as the Head, we absorb the riches of the extensive, all-inclusive Christ; these riches become in us the increase of God by which the Body grows for its building up&mdash;Col. 2:19, 7-8; Eph. 4:16.</li>

	<li>The Body is the intrinsic significance of the church; if there were no Body, the church would make no sense and have no meaning&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12, 27; 1:2.</li>
	<li>It is crucial for us to realize that Christ is the Head and that we are the members of His Body&mdash;Col. 1:18a; 2:19; Eph. 4:15-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To live in the Body is to live corporately with the members under the Head.</li>
		<li>To live the Body life, we must be under the Head and take the Head as our life, the principal object, and the center of our whole being&mdash;Col. 1:18a; 2:19.</li>
		<li>Whenever we enjoy Christ, we automatically hold Him as the Head&mdash;vv. 9-10, 16-17, 19.</li>
		<li>The first principle of living in the Body of Christ is to obey the authority of the Head&mdash;Eph. 4:15:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ is the Head of the Body, and life can flow freely only when He is in full control&mdash;v. 16.</li>
			<li>The Body&rsquo;s only duty toward the Head is obedience and submission without any opinion, idea, or proposal&mdash;John 21:20-22; Acts 13:1-4a.</li>
			<li>Our relationship to the Head determines our relationship to the other members of the Body&mdash;9:10-19:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) If we hold the Head, we cannot have a special feeling for or a special relationship and fellowship with any individual or group of individuals.</li>
				<li>2) There is no room for our preferences in the Body&mdash;1 Cor. 1:10-12.</li>
				</ol></li>

	<li>Our goal in preaching the gospel is to obtain material for the building up of the Body of Christ; for this, we must be prepared to suffer, even to be opposed and persecuted&mdash;John 15:18-21; 16:1-3.</li>

	<li>God gives the growth by giving Himself to us in a subjective way&mdash;3:16-17a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For God to give us growth actually means that He gives us Himself&mdash;1 Cor. 3:6-7.</li>
		<li>Without the increase of God within us, there cannot be any growth.</li>
		<li>The more God is added to us, the more growth He gives&mdash;Eph. 4:15-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the one Body of Christ we were called to the peace of Christ, which is Christ Himself&mdash;Col. 3:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>By Christ&rsquo;s abolishing in His flesh the separating ordinances, that is, His slaying the enmity, and by His creating the Jewish and Gentile believers into one new man, peace was made between all the believers&mdash;Eph. 2:15-16.</li>
	<li>The peace of Christ is the oneness of the new man, the Body&mdash;4:3.</li>
	<li>For the Body life we should let the peace of Christ decide all things in our heart in our relationship with the members of His Body&mdash;Col. 3:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As members of the Body, we need to have the consciousness of the Body and have a feeling for the Body&mdash;1 Cor. 12:25-26; Rom. 12:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since the Christ we enjoy is the Head of the Body, the more we enjoy Him, the more we become conscious of the Body&mdash;Col. 2:9-10, 16-17, 19.</li>
	<li>Like Paul, we should take the feeling of the Head as our own feeling; this is most necessary for our living the Body life&mdash;Phil. 1:8.</li>
	<li>The feeling for the Body of Christ is closely related to one&rsquo;s frame of mind, that is, to one&rsquo;s perception of things&mdash;Col. 2:18; 3:2; Rom. 12:2-3; Eph. 4:23.</li>
	<li>Whatever we do involves the Body; thus, in all that we do, we should care for the Body, taking the Body as the rule in our mind, thoughts, words, and actions&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12-27; 2 Cor. 8:21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The unique Body of Christ is expressed in many localities as the local churches&mdash;Col. 4:15-16; Eph. 4:4; Rev. 1:4, 11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Body of Christ is the source of the local churches; the universal Body is like the father to all the churches, and the local churches are like the children to the father&mdash;Rom. 12:4-5; 16:1, 4-5, 16.</li>
	<li>The one Body is the one church of God, manifested in many localities as many local churches&mdash;Matt. 16:18; 18:17; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:21-22; 1 Cor. 1:2; 12:27.</li>
	<li>A local church is an expression of the Body of Christ in a certain locality&mdash;1:2; 10:32b, 17; 12:12-13, 20, 27.</li>
	<li>The church in a certain locality was often the church in a certain person&rsquo;s house; the meetings in the saints&rsquo; homes afford every attending believer the opportunity to function, and they also strengthen the mutual fellowship among the saints&mdash;Col. 4:15-16; Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:19; Philem. 2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Body is versus the self; the enemy of the Body is the self&mdash;Col. 2:18-19, 23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The hindrance to seeing the vision of the Body and to practicing the Body is the self&mdash;vv. 18, 23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The greatest frustration to the building up of the Body is the self; the self is the real division, the real sect.</li>
		<li>When we have the self, we do not have the Body; when we have the Body, we do not have the self&mdash;Matt. 16:18, 24.</li>
		<li>If we would be built up in the Body, the self must be condemned, denied, rejected, and renounced&mdash;Luke 9:23-24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We should deny ourselves and identify ourselves with the Body; if we do this, the life that we live will fully be the Body life, and the Lord will gain the expression of His Body&mdash;Matt. 16:24; 1 Cor. 12:27; Col. 1:18a; 3:15.</li>

<h1 class="title">Experiencing Christ as Our Life</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:1-4</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In order to experience Christ as our life, we need to see that we have one position, one life, one living, one destiny, and one glory with Christ&mdash;vv. 1-4; cf. 1 Cor. 6:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Our position is that we are in Christ; because we are in Him, we are where He is&mdash;sitting at the right hand of God&mdash;Col. 3:1; John 17:24; Eph. 2:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Son&rsquo;s position is in the Father (John 10:38; 14:10); we are in the Son (1 Cor. 1:30a), so we are in the Father (John 14:20; 1 Thes. 1:1; 2 Thes. 1:1).</li>
		<li>It is when we are in the spirit that we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven practically and experientially:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>There is a transmission taking place from Christ in heaven to us on earth by means of the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit&mdash;Eph. 1:19, 22-23; 2:22.</li>
			<li>The very Christ who is sitting on the throne in heaven (Rom. 8:34) is also now in us (v. 10), that is, in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), where the dwelling place, the habitation, of God is (Eph. 2:22).</li>
			<li>Since today our spirit is the place of God&rsquo;s habitation, it is now the gate of heaven, where Christ is the ladder that joins us to heaven and brings heaven to us&mdash;v. 22; Gen. 28:12-17; John 1:51.</li>
			<li>Whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter through the gate of heaven and touch the throne of grace in heaven through Christ as the heavenly ladder; our spirit is the receiving end of the divine transmission, whereas the throne of God is the transmitting end&mdash;Heb. 4:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The life of God is the life of Christ, and the life of Christ has become our life&mdash;John 5:26; Col. 3:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For Christ to be our life means that He is subjective to us to the uttermost&mdash;John 1:4; 14:6a; 10:10b; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:10, 6, 11.</li>
		<li>It is impossible to separate a person from the life of that person, for a person&rsquo;s life is the person himself; thus, to say that Christ is our life means that Christ has become us and that we have one life and living with Him&mdash;John 14:6a; Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		<li>With Christ as the believers&rsquo; life there are three characteristics, which distinguish it from the natural life:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This life is a crucified life&mdash;Gal. 2:20.</li>
			<li>This life is a resurrected life&mdash;John 11:25.</li>
			<li>This life is a life hidden in God&mdash;Col. 3:3-4; Matt. 6:1-6, 16-18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To seek the things which are above and set our mind on them is to join ourselves to the Lord in His heavenly ministry, His divine enterprise; this is to live Christ, to have a living that is one with Christ&rsquo;s living&mdash;Col. 3:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His heavenly ministry, Christ today is living as the High Priest to intercede for the churches&mdash;Heb. 8:1; 4:14; 7:25; 4:16; Col. 4:2.</li>
		<li>In His heavenly ministry, Christ today is living as the heavenly Minister to supply the saints with the riches of Christ&mdash;Heb. 8:1-2; Eph. 3:8.</li>
		<li>In His heavenly ministry, Christ today is living as the universal Administrator of God&rsquo;s government for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;Rev. 4:1-2, 5; 5:6; 1:11-12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>From the throne in the heavens, the divine transmission brings the things above into the local churches&mdash;Eph. 1:19, 22-23.</li>
			<li>In Revelation 4 and 5 we have a vision of our &ldquo;central government,&rdquo; and in Revelation 1 through 3 we have a vision of the local churches as the &ldquo;embassies&rdquo;; through the seven Spirits what is in the heavenly &ldquo;headquarters&rdquo; is transmitted into the churches as the &ldquo;embassies.&rdquo;</li>
			<li>What takes place in the local churches should be under the direction of the throne of God in heaven; in order for the recovery to be the <em>Lord&rsquo;s</em> recovery, it must be under His direction&mdash;Col. 1:18; 2:19; Rev. 4:2-3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Our destiny is glory; Christ is leading us into glory for us to be manifested with Him in glory&mdash;Heb. 2:10; Col. 3:4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Our life is the Christ who dwells within us, and this life is hidden with Christ in God; the Christ hidden in God is typified by the manna hidden in the golden pot&mdash;vv. 3-4; Exo. 16:32-34; Rev. 2:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ as the hidden manna is in God the Father as the golden pot; the Father is in Christ as the Ark with His two natures, divinity and humanity; and Christ as the indwelling Spirit lives in our regenerated spirit to be the reality of the Holy of Holies&mdash;cf. John 14:16-20; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li>
	<li>When we eat Christ as the hidden manna, we are incorporated into Him for the mutual abode of God and man&mdash;John 15:5, 7; 8:31; 6:57, 63; 14:23.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>That Christ is our life is a strong indication that we are to take Him as life and live by Him, that we are to live Him in our daily life&mdash;Col. 3:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ must be our life in a practical and experiential way; day by day we need to be saved in His life&mdash;v. 4; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 5:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be saved in the divine life from the slavery of sin, the law of sin, is by the release of the law of the consummated Spirit&mdash;8:2.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life from the present age of the world is by the sanctification of the consummated Spirit&mdash;12:2a; 6:19b, 22b.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life from our natural being is by the transformation of the life-giving Spirit&mdash;12:2b.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life from individualism is by being built up in the Body of Christ&mdash;v. 5.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life from self-likeness is by the conformation of the life-imparting Spirit&mdash;8:29.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life from our body of humiliation is by the transfiguration in the virtue of the divine life&mdash;v. 30; Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:11.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life is to reign in the divine life&mdash;5:17.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life will result in the victory over Satan&mdash;16:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The new man is the spontaneous issue of our taking Christ as our life and living Him&mdash;Col. 3:3-4, 10-11.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:5-11, 17; Eph. 2:15; 4:22-24</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The ultimate goal of God in His economy is to gain the new man constituted with the all-inclusive, extensive, preeminent Christ wrought into a corporate people&mdash;Col. 1:27; 2:2, 9, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11.</li>
<li>The new man equals the Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 10, 15; Eph. 2:15-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>The new man</em> and <em>the Body</em> are synonyms and may be used interchangeably:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The emphasis on the church being the Body of Christ is on life; the emphasis on the church being the one new man is on the person&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12; Eph. 4:4; 2:15; 4:24.</li>
		<li>As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life; as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person&mdash;Col. 3:4; Eph. 3:17a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ and we together form a universal man; as the One in heaven, Christ is the Head, and as those on earth, we are the Body&mdash;Col. 1:18a.</li>
	<li>The new man is the corporate God-man, with Christ, the firstborn Son, as the Head and the believers, the many sons of God, as the Body; for the new man as the corporate God-man we need to live the life of a God-man&mdash;3:10; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10; Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Although the new man was already created in Christ, we still need to put on the new man&mdash;Col. 3:10; Eph. 2:15; 4:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since the new man is the Body of Christ, to put on the new man means to live a life by the Body, not individually but corporately:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Individualism is hateful in the sight of God; if we would know the Body, we need to be delivered from our individualistic life&mdash;1 Cor. 12:18-20.</li>
		<li>The strongest proof that we have seen the Body is that we can no longer be individualistic&mdash;Acts 9:4-6; Philem. 14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Before our salvation we were living in the old man, in the old society, but now we are members of Christ, living in His Body; thus, we should put off the old man with the old social life and put on the new man, the church&mdash;Col. 3:10, 15; Eph. 4:4, 22-24.</li>
	<li>In order to put on the new man in an experiential way, we need to take Christ as our person&mdash;3:17a; Gal. 2:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is the new man, and in this new man there is only one person&mdash;Christ&mdash;Matt. 17:5; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		<li>The old man must be put off, and we must live by our new person&mdash;vv. 5-9; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 4:22-24.</li>
		<li>When we live by taking Christ as our person, especially in making decisions, our living will be the living of the new man&mdash;John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38; Rom. 15:32; James 4:13-15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we would put on the new man in a practical way, we need to do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus&mdash;Col. 3:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The name denotes the person, and the Lord&rsquo;s person is the Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 3:17a.</li>
		<li>To do things in the name of the Lord is to act in the Spirit; this is to live Christ&mdash;Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:4; Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The new man is Christ constituted into us&mdash;Col. 3:10-11; Eph. 3:17a; 4:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the One who indwells us and who is our life, Christ is the constituent of the new man&mdash;Col. 1:27; 3:4.</li>
	<li>The Christ we enjoy as our God-allotted portion becomes the constituent of the new man&mdash;1:12; 3:10-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Through enjoying the all-inclusive, extensive, preeminent Christ we experience Him as the content and constituent of the new man.</li>
		<li>The issue of our experience and enjoyment of Christ is the church as the new man; as we enjoy Christ, He is constituted into us, and we become the new man&mdash;1:27; 3:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because Christ is all and in all, in the new man there is room only for Christ; there is no room for the natural man&mdash;v. 11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Since Christ is all and in all in the new man and we are part of the new man, we are part of Christ.</li>
		<li>Christ is everyone in the new man, and He is in everyone in the new man&mdash;v. 11.</li>
		<li>The only way Christ can be all and in all in the new man is for Him to be constituted into us&mdash;Eph. 3:17a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Concerning the new man, we need to be &ldquo;renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him&rdquo;&mdash;Col. 3:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because the new man was created with us, who belong to the old creation (Eph. 2:15), as his constituents, he needs to be renewed; this renewing takes place mainly in our mind as the mingled spirit spreads into our mind and saturates it&mdash;Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23.</li>
	<li>The new man is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of the One who created him&mdash;Col. 3:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This image is Christ, God&rsquo;s Beloved&mdash;the wonderful, glorious, all-inclusive Christ&mdash;as the expression of God&mdash;1:15.</li>
		<li>We need to be renewed in our mind unto full knowledge according to the expression of God, according to what Christ is.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The renewing of the new man depends on our seeking the things which are above&mdash;3:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we turn to the heavenly Christ with all His activities and set our mind on these things, the renewing of the new man will take place spontaneously&mdash;Heb. 8:1-2; 12:2; Col. 3:2, 10.</li>
		<li>When we set our mind on the things above, the way is open for the divine element to spread from our regenerated spirit into our soul; this spreading of the divine element within us is according to Christ, who is the image of God, God&rsquo;s expression.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:10-11; 4:7-17; Philem. 1-2, 10-22</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In Colossians 4:7-17 we have an illustration of the revelation of the new man given in 3:10-11 and a record of the fellowship of the new man:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s purpose in 4:7-17 is to present an illustration, a detailed portrait, of the living of the new man:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In spite of all the differences among nationalities, races, and classes, there was on earth in a practical way the living of the one new man created in Christ Jesus&mdash;Eph. 2:10, 15.</li>
		<li>There were not merely local churches in various cities&mdash;there was one new man in a real and practical way&mdash;Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The apostle&rsquo;s fellowship shows us that the new man as practiced at the apostle&rsquo;s time was an issue of the apostle&rsquo;s work, which encouraged the believers to seek after Christ, the constituent of the new man, as their enjoyment&mdash;1:12-13, 27; 3:4, 10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Within Paul there was the sense, the consciousness, of the new man&mdash;4:7-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Both the saints in Colossae and Paul and those with him were members of the new man in actuality and had the consciousness of the new man:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fact that Paul mentioned many names indicates that he had the consciousness of the new man&mdash;vv. 9-17.</li>
		<li>Because Paul had the consciousness of the new man, he charged Tychicus to make known to the Colossians all that concerned him&mdash;v. 7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s word regarding the reading of letters proves that there was no difference between the church in Laodicea and the church in Colossae; his word implies fellowship, oneness, harmony, and intimate contact&mdash;v. 16.</li>
	<li>We need to be conscious of the church, of the Body, and of the new man:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The record in the book of Acts regarding the church reveals that the believers were church-conscious&mdash;5:11; 8:1, 3; 9:31; 11:22, 26; 12:1, 5; 13:1; 14:23, 27; 15:3-4, 22, 41; 16:5; 18:22; 20:17, 28:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In their concept there was nothing of individualism; they did everything with a consciousness of the church&mdash;2:44; 4:23, 32.</li>
			<li>Based upon the record in Acts, we have the principle that whatever we do and whenever and wherever we meet, we must be church-conscious.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the church life we should learn to have the consciousness of the Body, a Body-consciousness&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12-27:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In order to live and move with other members of the Body, we need to have the consciousness of the Body.</li>
			<li>Wherever there is Body-consciousness, individual thought and action are ruled out&mdash;Acts 9:1-19.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Like Paul, we should have the consciousness of the new man, realizing that all the saints in all the churches are the new man&mdash;Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10-11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Any church that isolates itself from other churches has a consciousness only of itself, not a consciousness of the totality of the new man.</li>
			<li>If we are conscious of the new man, we will not think that the churches in our country have nothing to do with the churches in other nations; instead, we will realize that all the churches are the one new man today&mdash;Eph. 2:15; Rev. 1:11; 2:1a.</li>
			<li>By means of the traffic among the churches, we experience in a practical way the living of the new man; such a living has Christ as its reality&mdash;Col. 1:12; 2:16-17; 3:4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The subject of the book of Philemon is an illustration of the believers&rsquo; equal status in the new man:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The case of Onesimus and Philemon illustrates that in the new man all the believers have an equal status.</li>
	<li>This Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality in eternal life and divine love of all the members of the Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 1, 9.</li>
	<li>The equal status of the believers is a matter of love, which comes out of faith; in the new man the believers love one another in faith&mdash;v. 5; Titus 3:15.</li>
	<li>Because of the divine birth and living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ have an equal status in the new man; this is based on three facts:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s death has abolished the ordinances of the different ways of living for the creation of the one new man&mdash;Eph. 2:15.</li>
		<li>We have all been baptized into Christ and made one in Him&mdash;Gal. 3:27-28.</li>
		<li>In the new man Christ is all and in all&mdash;Col. 3:11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Epistle to Philemon should be regarded as a continuation of Colossians 4 and considered an illustration of how in the new man all social rank is put aside&mdash;Philem. 1-2, 10-22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The distinction of social rank and status among the believers has been nullified because the believers have been constituted with the all-inclusive Christ, who is their life&mdash;Col. 3:4.</li>
		<li>In the Epistle to Philemon Paul gives the churches an illustration of how slaves and masters have been reconstituted with Christ; as a result, they are all part of the new man and have an equal status in the new man&mdash;vv. 10-11.</li>
		<li>In the practice of the economy of God, it is crucial that all social ranks and differences among races and nations be swallowed up&mdash;Col. 3:10-11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the new man distinctions on the basis of color have been nullified; Paul strongly taught this, and we must consider it part of the full knowledge of the truth&mdash;1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:25; Titus 1:1.</li>
			<li>If we see that the believers have an equal status in the new man, there will be no problems among us concerning social rank, nationality, or race&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:10-11.</li>

	<li>The Greek term for <em>arbitrate</em> can also be rendered &ldquo;umpire, preside, or be enthroned as a ruler and decider of everything&rdquo;; the arbitrating peace of Christ dissolves our complaint against anyone&mdash;Col. 3:13.</li>
	<li>Often we are conscious of three parties within us: a positive party, a negative party, and a neutral party; hence, there is the need for inward arbitration to settle the disputes within us:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Whenever we sense that different parties within our being are arguing or quarreling, we need to give place to the presiding peace of Christ and allow this peace, which is the oneness of the new man, to rule within us and have the final word.</li>
		<li>We need to set aside our opinion, our concept, and listen to the word of the indwelling Referee.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we allow the peace of Christ to arbitrate in our hearts, this peace will settle all the disputes among us; we shall have peace with God vertically and with the saints horizontally:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Through the arbitration of the peace of Christ, our problems are solved, and the friction between the saints disappears; then the church life is preserved in sweetness, and the new man is maintained in a practical way.</li>
		<li>The arbitrating of the peace of Christ is Christ working within us to exercise His rule over us, to speak the last word, and to make the final decision&mdash;cf. Isa. 9:6-7.</li>
		<li>If we stay under the ruling of the enthroned peace of Christ, we shall not offend others or damage them; rather, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace and with His peace we shall minister life to others.</li>
		<li>This peace should bind all the believers together and become their uniting bond&mdash;Eph. 4:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly&mdash;Col. 3:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When the peace of Christ arbitrates in us and keeps us in a situation full of oneness and harmony, we become the place of God&rsquo;s speaking, His oracle&mdash;vv. 15-16; Rev. 2:1, 7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s speaking requires oneness; division causes God&rsquo;s speaking to diminish, even to cease altogether&mdash;Lev. 1:1.</li>
		<li>Since oneness is a necessary condition for God&rsquo;s speaking, we need to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts&mdash;Col. 3:15.</li>
		<li>For the word of Christ to dwell in us richly means that it has adequate room in us to permeate and saturate our whole being; it is crucial for us to let the word of Christ enter into us, dwell in us, prevail in us, and replace our concepts, opinions, and philosophies&mdash;Psa. 119:130; cf. Rev. 21:23; 22:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to allow the word of the Lord to have the first place in us so that we may experience the functions of the word of God operating within us, ministering the riches of Christ into our being&mdash;Col. 3:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The word of God enlightens (Psa. 119:105, 130), nourishes (Matt. 4:4; 1 Tim. 4:6), and waters us to quench our thirst (Isa. 55:1, 8-11).</li>
		<li>The word of God strengthens (1 John 2:14b; Prov. 4:20-22), washes (Eph. 5:26), and builds us up (Acts 20:32).</li>
		<li>The word of God completes, perfects (2 Tim. 3:15-17), and edifies us by sanctifying us (John 17:17).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>By allowing the word of God to inhabit us, we can become a proper human being, a God-man filled with Christ as the reality of the attributes of God&mdash;Col. 3:16-25; Phil. 4:5-8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to persevere in prayer&mdash;Col. 4:2-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to allow adequate time for prayer, which will enable us to absorb more of the riches of Christ as the all-inclusive land&mdash;1:12; 2:6-7; 4:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to take time to absorb the Lord, contacting Him in a definite and prevailing way&mdash;Luke 8:13; Matt. 14:22-23; 6:6.</li>
		<li>To meet with God in the morning is not only to meet with Him early in the day; it is also to meet with God in a situation that is full of light; we should go to God alone, without any persons, matters, or things to distract or occupy us&mdash;Prov. 4:18; Exo. 33:11a; 34:3-4; Mark 1:35.</li>
		<li>When we pray, coming forward to the throne of grace, grace will become a river flowing in us and supplying us&mdash;Heb. 4:16; cf. Rev. 22:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to fight on God&rsquo;s side against Satan, we need to persevere in prayer&mdash;Dan. 6:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As those who take sides with God, we find that the whole fallen universe is against us and, in particular, against our prayer; resistance to prayer lies not only outside of us but even within us&mdash;Matt. 26:41.</li>
		<li>To pray is to go against the current, the trend, in the fallen universe&mdash;Luke 18:1-8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to set aside definite times for prayer; our attitude should be that prayer is our most important business and that nothing should be allowed to interfere with it&mdash;Dan. 6:10; Acts 12:5, 12.</li>
	<li>We need to remain in an atmosphere of prayer by continually exercising our spirit&mdash;Eph. 6:18; 1 Tim. 4:7; 2 Tim. 1:7; Col. 1:3, 9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to pray without ceasing, to persevere in prayer, keeping ourselves intimately connected to the Lord&mdash;1 Thes. 5:17; Matt. 26:41; Col. 2:19.</li>
		<li>Even in the smallest details we need to inquire of the Lord; to do this is to persevere in prayer and thereby to live Christ&mdash;cf. Josh. 9:14; Phil. 4:6-8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As we are ruled by the peace of Christ and inhabited by the word of Christ through persevering in prayer, He permeates and replaces us with Himself until all of our natural distinctions have been eliminated and we become the new man in reality&mdash;Col. 3:15-17; 4:2-3; 3:10-11.</li>
