   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE CHURCH IN SARDIS Scripture Reading: Rev 3:1-6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that during the time of the apostles there was the behavior of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the behavior of the Nicolaitans, we have seen how Pergamos sinned greatly by bringing the world into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the Nicolaitans came Jezebel, and at the same time idols were brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But there is a good point here: In Thyatira we see the judgment of Jezebel, the casting of her into a bed that she may not move; we also see that her followers will one day be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These prophecies have not yet been fulfilled; they will be fulfilled at the time of Babylon's fall in Revelation 17.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The history of Thyatira began from the time Jezebel improperly brought idols into the church and will continue until she receives judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we must see one thing: When the church, in her continuous fall from the Nicolaitans, comes to the stage of Jezebel, God can no longer tolerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then Sardis emerges.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Sardis'' means "the remains.''</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church in Sardis is God's reaction to Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The history of revival in the churches throughout the entire world indicates divine reactions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever the Lord begins a revival work, He is reacting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's reaction is man's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would like you to keep this principle firmly in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sardis appears because the Lord has seen the condition of Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Revelation several churches are in pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sardis is connected with Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Philadelphia is connected with Smyrna, and Laodicea is connected with Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only Thyatira stands alone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Sardis the Lord says that His name is "He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead'' Rev 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The epistle to Ephesus says that His right hand holds seven stars, while the epistle to Sardis says that He has the seven stars.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesus is the slackening after the apostles, that is, the changing from something good to bad; Sardis is the recovery from Thyatira, that is, the changing from something bad to good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Having works but no love is Ephesus; living in name but dead in reality is Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So these two are a pair.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord manifests Himself as He who has the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seven Spirits of God are sent of God to the world to work, and this refers to the work of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The seven stars in Ephesus refer to the messengers; here they refer to the illumination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The work of recovery is half in the Spirit and half in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sardis is similar to Thyatira in that she includes a long period of time, from the reformed churches until the Lord comes back again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the time of Sardis is not as long as Thyatira, she refers not only to the church during the Reformation, but also to church history following the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead.''</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe no one will doubt that Martin Luther was a servant of the Lord and the Reformation was the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Reformation was a great work, and it was a divine reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Surely the Lord used Luther as a mouthpiece; he was a man especially chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Luther first started, the Reformation was entirely Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His purpose was solely for recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord does not say that the work of Luther was not good; rather, He says it was not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was good, but not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the eyes of the Lord, He has not found anything complete everything was a beginning without an end. The Lord is a Lord of completion; therefore, He requires completion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, we must ask Him that we may see.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The problem of justification was solved following Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Justification is by faith, and having peace before the Lord is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Luther not only gave us justification by faith; he also gave us an open Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Thyatira the authority is in the hands of Jezebel in other words, in the hands of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a matter of what the church says, not what the Lord says.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is all a matter of what the mother church says: All the people of the Roman Catholic Church listen to the mother church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So the Lord says He will kill her "children.''</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You say the mother, but the Lord says the children.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Luther showed us what the Lord says and what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Men can read God's Word, and men can see for themselves what God actually says, not what Rome says.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the open Bible comes, the whole church is enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, a problem arises: Protestantism did not give us a proper church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a result, wherever the doctrine of justification by faith and the open Bible went, a state church was established.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lutheran sect became the state church in many countries.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Later, in England the Anglican Church came into being, which is also a state church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Beginning with Rome, the nature of the church was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By the time of justification by faith and the return of the open Bible, the Protestant churches had not yet seen what the church should be.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although there were justification by faith and the open Bible, the Protestant churches still followed the example of Rome and did not return to the church in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>During the Reformation the problem of the church was not solved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Luther did not reform the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Luther himself said that we should not think "justification by faith'' is enough; there are many more things to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yet the people in the Protestant churches stopped right there.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Luther did not stop, but they stopped and said that it was good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although they went back to the faith of the beginning, the church herself remained unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Formerly, there was the international church of Rome; now it is the state church of England or the state church of Germany that is all.</S>
