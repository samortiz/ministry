   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TEN BEING WEAK IN THE LORD Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 13:4; 12:9-10; 1 Cor 2:2-5 HINDRANCES TO SPIRITUAL GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SELF-PROCLAIMED STRENGTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians have problems and are not growing because they are not weak enough in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They consider themselves strong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They say that they know their problems, yet they remain the same and are never delivered from their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people are very opinionated and talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They do not see the evil of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes they even boast in their confessions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The stronghold of these ones is their self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They have instant assurance and judgment concerning everything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They know whether something is right or wrong and its advantages or disadvantages.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such ones have to learn the proper lessons from the Lord; they have to lose their self-confidence and assurance before they can advance spiritually and before they can become useful in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE EXPERIENCE OF PETER</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before the Lord's death Peter was very confident and self-assured in what he said and did.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you were to say to him that he was too quick, he surely would have argued with you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet, after the Lord was betrayed and captured, Peter became so weak that he denied the Lord before the face of the maid of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not deny the Lord just once but three times.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The last time he even swore in his denial of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that moment the cock crowed, and he remembered the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He received revelation and came to know himself, and he went out to weep Matt 26:69-75 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the Lord resurrected, He appeared to Peter by the sea and asked him three times, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter could only say, "Lord, You know that I love You" John 21:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter was no longer so confident.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He dared not say that he could die for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He could no longer say that he would not stumble even if everyone else stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A man who has passed through the cross and who has been dealt with by God is weak all of his self-confidence and assurance have been shattered.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE EXPERIENCE OF MOSES</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Old Testament there was Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From the time he was a child until he was forty years old, he learned the Egyptian knowledge in Pharaoh's palace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was powerful in words and deeds, and he became very confident in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, he had to run away to the land of Midian when he was forty years old, and he became a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All his learning became useless.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was dealt with and lost his self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He was called by God forty years later, he told the Lord, "O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue" Exo 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was so afraid to speak that he wanted his brother Aaron to be his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although Aaron did become his mouth, eventually Moses still spoke for God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By then Moses was qualified to be used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His self-confidence in his own education and capability was completely shattered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He had become a servant of God, and God could use him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who have received revelation and light from the Lord are persons who first have been totally stripped of their strength before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We see this in David, Jeremiah, Isaiah, etc. They all felt as if they had nothing and could do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A Christian must be a person who has lost all self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only after he has lost his self-confidence will he look to God alone, and only then can God use him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ was crucified out of weakness, and Paul was weak in Him 2 Cor 13:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christians often want to participate in Christ's resurrection and ascension, but they often forget that they should be weak in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the cross the Lord prayed to the Father that He would forgive those who crucified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet He also said, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It seems that our Lord was quite weak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The apostle Paul told the Corinthians believers, "For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified" 1 Cor 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said that when he was with the church in Corinth, he was in weakness and in fear and in much trembling v. 3 . He preached the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was not like today's revivalists, who conduct conference after conference with power and energy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul was apparently weak, and he only preached the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet this preaching manifested the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whether or not a man can be weak before the Lord has nothing to do with his knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only those who have received revelation can be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Performed weakness does not last, and others can see clearly that it is not the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Weakness that results from revelation is not something that can be forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After Peter was dealt with by the Lord, it was hard for him even to confess his love to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He could only say, "Lord, You know."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He no longer had any self-confidence; he had lost his self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He was not bold to speak quickly or judge confidently.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is genuine weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who are good at criticizing others, who can easily pinpoint the faults of others, have never seen this revelation; they do not know themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Everyone who is confident in himself and who believes in his own judgment does not know his own weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>THE LORD'S POWER</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>BEING PERFECTED IN MAN'S WEAKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Second Corinthians 12:9 says that the Lord's power is perfected in man's weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A strong person can never experience the power of Christ tabernacling over him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who put considerable emphasis on the outpouring of power cannot receive the outpouring unless they first know that they are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If they do not know that they are weak, they can only remain on the level of the Corinthian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Paul knew this secret.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, he boasted in his weaknesses so that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>During my stay in Honor Oak, England, I met one visitor who was a famous author and expositor.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we were together, he often would expound this or that passage in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Yet I knew in my heart that his spiritual stature did not even come close to that of the old sister working in the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He had not been dealt with by the Lord, and his natural life had not been eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He did not know his weakness, and God's power was not made perfect in him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is not a question of whether or not we can expound the Bible well.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The question is whether or not we are the right person.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Once I asked Brother Austin-Sparks whether he was taking a step forward or backward in his knowledge of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He told me that he had taken a big step backward.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Formerly, he seemed to know everything and was confident about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But now he could only say, "It seems...."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Yet at the same time, he became more dependent on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Those who love to write expositions about the book of Revelation are often just elementary students of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Those who have genuinely received revelation will not be as quick to criticize, propose, speak, expound, or judge anything.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They have become weak through the revelation they have received.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>A weak person is a person who can tremble.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He is one who is always afraid of frustrating God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He looks to God and seeks after Him in a genuine way and never oversteps Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God can use only such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>May the cross defeat us, and may we be weak in Him so that His power can tabernacle over us.</S>
