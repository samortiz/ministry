   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX ISRAEL S EXODUS FROM EGYPT 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 12:29-42, 51; 13:1-22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing messages, we considered the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to Israel s exodus from Egypt, an event which followed the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we all know, the word exodus means a going out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The points we shall cover in this message concerning the exodus from Egypt are all to be found in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, if we read the words of the New Testament without considering the picture of the exodus presented in the Old Testament, we shall not be impressed very deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, we need to consider both the words in the New Testament and the picture in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Often we are able to grasp spiritual things more adequately through pictures than through words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In New Testament terms, to have an exodus is to get out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, without the picture in the book of Exodus, it is difficult to say just how we are able to get out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To talk about this matter without consulting the picture may lead only to confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we thank the Lord both for the picture in the Old Testament and for the plain words in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I. PHARAOH AND THE EGYPTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>HAVING BEEN SUBDUED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The children of Israel did not make their exodus from Egypt of their own accord or by their own power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they had been left to themselves, they never could have come out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The exodus was accomplished by the saving God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Firstly, God subdued Pharaoh, the one who had usurped the children of Israel, and then He subdued all the Egyptians 12:29-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we apply this principle to our experience, we see that God comes in to subdue Satan, everything and everyone that stands with Satan, and also our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the children of Israel made their exodus from Egypt, the whole environment was subdued by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything was set for the children of Israel to leave Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if they had wanted to remain in Egypt, the environment would not have allowed them to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They had no choice except to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the picture in the book of Exodus, God s salvation includes the aspect of the Passover and the aspect of the exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was easy for God s people to observe the Passover, but it was not easy for them to have an exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The difficulty lay in the fact that the exodus required a suitable environment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose the situation in Egypt did not allow God s people to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How then could they have made their exodus?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It would have been impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The exodus required a thorough subduing of the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Israel s exodus was the result of a long struggle between Moses and Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was preceded by twelve negotiations with ten plagues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that it is not easy for God to deliver His chosen people from the usurping hand of Satan and from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All genuine Christians have experienced the Passover, but only a small minority of believers have experienced the exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The reason for this is that certain aspects of their environment have not yet been subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If our environment has not been subdued, we may have the Passover, but not the exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps your wife, husband, or relatives need to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When some hear that their environment must be subdued, they may be discouraged and want to give up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, not even the matter of giving up depends on us; it depends wholly on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead of giving up, we should cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be rescued from the usurping hand of Satan and from the world, we need God s hand to subdue our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this record we are told twice that by strength of hand the Lord brought the children of Israel out of Egypt 13:3, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s people were saved not only by the blood of the Passover lamb, but also by the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The blood saved them from God s righteous judgment, but the hand saved them from Pharoah s usurpation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through Christ as our Passover we are saved from God s judgment, but by God s subduing hand we are saved from Satan and the world.</S>
