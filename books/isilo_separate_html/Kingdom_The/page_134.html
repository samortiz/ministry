When the young man asked which commandments, the Lord enumerated six: not to murder, not to commit adultery, not to steal, not to bear false witness, to honor his parents, and to love his neighbor as himself. The young man replied, "All these things I have observed; what do I lack yet?" (19:20). Although this was not his real condition, the Lord Jesus did not argue with him. The Lord Jesus simply said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven, and come, follow Me" (v. 21). The Lord's words were a real test of his genuine love for his neighbor. The Lord Jesus did not rebuke him; He simply placed the facts before him. As a result, the young man was exposed and went away sorrowful.</P><P>Then the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "It is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens....It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" (19:23-24). This saying is an expression showing impossibility. It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. When the disciples heard this, they were disappointed. Because they did not understand, they asked, "Who then can be saved?" (19:25). He answered, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible" (19:26). For a rich man to be saved is like a camel trying to go through the eye of a needle. It is impossible with man. But God is able to enlarge the eye of the needle, and He can also reduce the size of the camel. You are unable to do it, but God can. Therefore, do not be concerned&#151;be at peace.</P><P>Once again, we see that Peter appeared. Thank the Lord for Peter! Without such a good brother, many things would not have been exposed. When the Lord Jesus told the rich man sell all that he had, Peter certainly heard. When he heard, he compared it to what he and his brother had done in leaving the fishing wharf and following the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus had said to Peter and Andrew, "Follow Me," and immediately they had given up everything and followed Him (4:19-20). To a certain extent, Peter was boasting: "This rich man could not give up everything, but we did. Lord, when You called us we came. You asked us to follow You, and we did. We have forsaken everything. Now, Lord, what are You going to give us?" The Lord Jesus' answer shows that He is good and that He is God. He told Peter that He would receive exactly what he should receive. "You who have followed Me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel" (19:28). The Lord further promised that everyone who forsakes mother and father, brothers and sisters, and all that they have for His name's sake would receive a hundred times more and would inherit eternal life. He went on to tell Peter that many "that are first shall be last, and the last first" (19:29-30). Why did He tell Peter "the first shall be last, and the last first"? It was because Peter thought that he was able to pay the price of buying the kingdom, but the Lord was indicating to him that the kingdom is priceless and that he could never purchase it. The kingdom is of peerless worth, and its price is too high. He could never afford to buy it. What He had asked Peter to give up was not the price of gaining the kingdom. He had simply asked Peter to give up the frustrations. The kingdom is not a recompense; it is a reward. Peter needed to realize that the kingdom was not something he could buy at any price. He would never have sufficient means to buy the kingdom. The Lord had only asked him to forsake every entanglement and frustration. Then he would receive the kingdom as a reward, not as a recompense. The Lord did not act according to the commercial principle which says that the more you pay, the more you receive. Peter's concept was too commercial. The Lord was washing away that commercial concept by saying, "Many that are first shall be last, and the last first." How wise is the Lord Jesus!</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_133.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_135.html">Next</a> </body></html>
