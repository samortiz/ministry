   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIX THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF JOSEPH AND BENJAMIN 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jacob's prophecy regarding his twelve sons ends with a blessing that includes ten items.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The history of these twelve sons begins with a sinner, that is, it begins with sin, even with a gross sin, not a refined sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the beginning we have a person who is full of sin, and at the end we have a person who receives the universal blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the prophecy ends with the full blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With Joseph, everything is a blessing, and the blessing is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is blessing upon blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible is a wonderful book; no human mind can fully understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more we study the Bible, the more we realize how little we really know it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible is too profound.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ten blessings related to Joseph, for example, require the whole Bible for their development.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>BLESSED A. With the Precious Things of Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First are the blessings with the precious things of heaven above 49:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The precious things of heaven above certainly include rain and snow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These precious things must also include the angels, for the angels certainly are a blessing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are our servants and even camp around us Heb 1:13-14; Psa 34:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every believer has at least one angel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, Acts 12 speaks of Peter's angel v. 15 , and in the Gospel of Matthew the Lord Jesus indicates that we have angels 18:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The material things in the Old Testament are shadows of the reality in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the New Testament the blessings are spiritual blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this verse we have the words blessed and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are blessed with all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "places" is not found in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is difficult to say what the words "the heavenlies" definitely refer to.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Certainly this includes the heavenly nature, the heavenly position, the heavenly condition, the heavenly situation, the heavenly atmosphere, and the heavenly capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The spiritual blessings are of a heavenly nature, in a heavenly situation and atmosphere, and under a heavenly condition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, every aspect of these spiritual blessings is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we are enjoying these heavenly blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the New Testament reality and fulfillment, the precious things of heaven above are the blessings in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians chapter one reveals that one of these heavenly blessings is God's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God did not select us on earth, but in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, our selection is heavenly, with the heavenly nature, under a heavenly condition, and in a heavenly atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A second spiritual blessing is predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Predestination is nothing earthly; rather it is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After God selected us, He predestinated us, marked us out, in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This marking out is heavenly in nature, in atmosphere, and in condition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although the worldly people know nothing of the heavenly blessings, we are enjoying them, for we have been selected and predestinated by God from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all have been marked out, and wherever we go we bear this heavenly mark.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This mark was made in the heavenlies before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, it is not anything earthly, but heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The adoption to be the sons of God is another heavenly blessing mentioned in Ephesians 1.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Redemption and forgiveness are also included among these heavenly blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we are on earth, we are nonetheless enjoying the heavenly redemption and the heavenly forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The One who redeemed us and who has forgiven us is the very God in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our redemption and forgiveness come from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Besides all these, in Ephesians 1 there are also other items listed among the spiritual blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The heavenly rain and snow also come down upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are many who do not like snow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, those who live where there is snow are often healthier than those who live in a warm climate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whether we like it or not, in our spiritual life our heavenly Father sometimes sends snow upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is healthy to be outside in the snow; it is a marvelous enjoyment as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rain is good, and snow is enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These are some of the precious things of heaven above.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to constantly remind ourselves that we are under God's blessing of the precious things of heaven.</S>
