First, we should beware of several factors. These factors are like wolves, roaring lions, and speeding cars on the street that can harm us. The first factor is ambition. What I have written in the accompanying outline is according to my personal experience. I do not mean to say that only you have these negative points and I do not. I also have experienced them. Who does not have ambition? In the Lord&rsquo;s work, the ambition is to be the leader. If you are among the co-workers, you may want to be the leader. If you cannot be the first among them, you may still want to be the &ldquo;vice-president.&rdquo; Even the sisters who have roommates want to be the leader among them. In the church you may want to be the elder, even the leading elder, the leader of the elders.</p><p>Second, your ambition may also be to get a place, even a district, for your work. Who does not have such an ambition? I was with Brother Nee, and I learned of him. I never saw that he was ambitious to get a place, a certain district to be his district or little empire. A district in this sense is a little empire. You may want to be an emperor in your district, with everything under your control and rule and where everyone must listen to you. Who is not like this? I was like this, but the Lord dealt with me. Your ambition may also be to captivate people to be your private co-workers. You may attract, charm, and capture people for this purpose. This means that in your work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery you have a party in which certain ones who are very close to you have been captivated, attracted, and charmed by you. They appreciate your ability, and they appreciate your capacity, so they stand with you. Then they become your particular co-workers. They are co-workers generally, but in particular they are a certain person&rsquo;s co-workers. Do you not realize that there is such a situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? I have seen this in experience.</p><p>Beginning in 1984 I called three urgent conferences of the co-workers and elders. In my opening word I pointed out that among us there is the tendency of division. By this I meant that quite a few capable co-workers in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery liked to keep their district as their empire, and they liked to attract people to be their particular co-workers. We are all co-workers generally, but some became particular co-workers with certain attracting ones. Therefore, I warned you all. After my speaking, one of the co-workers stood to confess that this was the case. However, at that time I realized that his confession was not strong enough. It was very weak, and today he has become a problem in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. He still claims that he is in the recovery, and he still takes the ground of locality. He protests that his meeting is a local church, and he declares that he is one with Brother Lee. He accepts my ministry, and he receives standing orders of the books of the Living Stream Ministry even until today. Recently, he spoke to me for close to one hour to explain his stand. I told him I felt that it was not the Lord&rsquo;s timing to respond to him at that time. Later, after further consideration with the Lord, I felt that I had received a clear word and that it was the Lord&rsquo;s timing to respond. I felt to tell him, &ldquo;You are a division, and whatever you do in your place is a division because you cut your meeting off from all the churches in the recovery. Moreover, you like to visit the rebellious ones and stand with them. You should realize that all the churches are one Body. You cannot stand alone, separate from the other churches. If you do, you are a division.&rdquo; In Corinth some said, &ldquo;I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:12). Paul condemned them for this. Even if you say that you are of Christ, that is a division. It is as if Paul said to them, &ldquo;Is Christ divided? Why do you say that you are of Paul? Do not be of me. I am of you, and we all are of Christ.&rdquo; First Corinthians 1 shows us that there should not be any differences among us. No one is of Cephas, no one is of Apollos, no one is of Paul, the highest apostle, and no one is even of Christ separately from others. We all are of Christ, who is not divided.</p><p>Our fallen disposition by birth always likes to captivate people. If someone can do a work for the Lord, he may like to attract people. He may like to charm them and captivate them, and if he succeeds in captivating others, the captivated ones become members of his little party. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is the possibility of having such a party. If you have the opportunity and the time, you may do this. You have not done this because you have not had the opportunity, the condition, and the situation, but when you do have the opportunity, you may do it. This is the first &ldquo;underground gopher&rdquo; that damages the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. You may have been damaged by this. Within you there may be this very strong hidden &ldquo;gopher.&rdquo; I consider this as the first problem.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A Word of Love to the Co-Workers, Elders, Lovers, and Seekers of the Lord &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
