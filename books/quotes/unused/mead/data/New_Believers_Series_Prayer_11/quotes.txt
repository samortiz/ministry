[1]  PRAYER Scripture Reading: John 16:24; James 4:2-3; Luke 11:9-10; Psa 66:18; Mark 11:24; Luke 18:1-8 I. PRAYER BEING A BASIC CHRISTIAN RIGHT
[2]  Christians have a basic right while living on earth today, the right to receive answers to prayers.
[3]  The moment a person is regenerated, God gives him the basic right to ask of Him and to be heard by Him.
[4]  John 16 says that God answers when we ask in the name of the Lord so that our joy may be made full.
[5]  If we unceasingly pray, yet God does not unceasingly answer our prayer, or if we have been a Christian for years and God hardly or never listens to our prayers, there must be something seriously wrong.
[6]  If you ask to go in as well, the Lord will surely let you in. The Lord said, "Seek and you shall find" v. 7 . Suppose that there are many things here.
[7]  You should know when God has answered your prayers and when He has not answered your prayers.
[8]  If it makes no difference to you whether or not God answers your prayers, it will be hard for you to effectively pray to Him if you come across a difficulty in the future.
[9]  We should ask, but there is a second condition to prayer; we should not ask evilly.
[10]  "You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly" James 4:3 .
[11]  The Lord Jesus said, "All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them" v. 24 . We must believe when we pray.
[12]  The Lord said to the paralytic, "Child, your sins are forgiven" v. 5 . Some scribes reasoned in their hearts, saying, "Why is this man speaking this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except One, God?" v. 7 . In their hearts they thought that only God could forgive sins and that Jesus could not.
[13]  It is true that God can do everything, but how do I know that He is willing to heal me?
[14]  Whether or not God can do something is not the question here; rather, it is a question of whether or not God is willing.
[15]  We need to go back to Mark 11:24, which we quoted earlier: "All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."
[16]  If you believe and are confident that God can and will do a certain thing because He has given you a word concerning it, you should thank Him, saying, "God has done it!"
[17]  When new believers learn to pray, they should pray in two stages.
[18]  If you do not have a heart to pray, how can you expect God to have a heart to listen?
[19]  In this way, one will find out how many things he asks God for in a year, how many prayers God answers, and what prayers are still unanswered.
