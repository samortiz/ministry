   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROBLEMS OF PRIDE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE THOUGHT OF BEING A HERO, AND OPINIONS The Problem of Pride with the Young Ones</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am happy that we could be together in this elders' meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is probably the biggest elders' meeting we have had in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are five hundred thirty brothers here in attendance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I noticed that many young ones are among the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am happy about this, but I am also quite concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul's charge to us is that the "new hands" should be considered carefully before being brought into the realm, the circle, of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1 Timothy 3:6 Paul says that an overseer should not be a novice, or a new convert.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the other hand, there need to be learners in the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Learning spiritual things may be likened to learning a language.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is easier for a young person to learn a new language.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>An older person may learn a new language, but it is difficult for him to get rid of his accent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this sense, it is very good to have young ones in the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, I also want to warn the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have passed through your age, and I do know what is in a young man that can be a possible problem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This does not mean that we older ones do not have any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have our problem, the middle-aged brothers have their problem, and the young brothers have their problem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every age group has its problems.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you are young, the problem is your pride.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is hard for the young people to avoid pride.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the past sixty to seventy years, I have been watching over the recovery and the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have discovered that pride is the problem with the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the past seventy years, the Lord brought in some brilliant, marvelous, excellent young ones among us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, about eighty percent of the brilliant young ones whom the Lord brought into our realm were spoiled by their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, we are short of hands today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the recovery is real and rich in truth, the entire world is open to the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Especially, I would say that all of Central America and South America, with Puerto Rico and the Caribbean Islands, are open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have so many requests from these places for some to come and help them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This has become our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot bear this much.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are short of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we had fifty co-workers who would be able to go to help meet the present demand, it still would not be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In New Zealand, Australia, Korea, and southeastern Asia, there is also the need.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I received a letter three days ago from a brother in Mongolia.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I want to report to you that there is a local church of about twenty-five saints there in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Most of them are either students or professors in the universities.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The way they meet and serve is absolutely in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They have also asked for some to come there to help.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These ones in Mongolia are open and eager to know the Bible and to know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who will go to them?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows again that the door is wide open to the Lord's recovery.</S>
