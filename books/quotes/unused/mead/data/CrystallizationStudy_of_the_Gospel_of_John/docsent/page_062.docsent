   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord's most mysterious, organic speaking to the disciples is in John 14 through 16.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This took place in the night when He was betrayed and arrested, before His crucifixion, which happened the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After His long discourse of mysterious speaking, He offered a prayer to God, saying, "Father,...glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You" John 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then He went on to pray about the oneness of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. THE ORGANISM OF THE PROCESSED</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 14 through 17 reveals the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God and the believers' oneness incorporated with the oneness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Two onenesses are incorporated into one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An organism, like a tree, is a frame to contain the inner life for the development of that inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church, composed of God's called ones, is such a frame to contain the invisible God as life so that this life can be developed and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our human body is an organism containing our human life for the development and expression of that life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Body of Christ is just like our human body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is an organism to contain God, not the original God, but the processed and consummated God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. A Long Discourse</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>concerning the Issue of His Glorification</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 14 through 16 is a long discourse given by Christ to His disciples on the night before He was crucified concerning the issue of His glorification by the Father with His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without Christ's glorification, these three chapters could not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament, there are two major portions which speak of the Divine Trinity clearly and definitely.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first one is Matthew 28:19, where the Lord charged us to baptize people into the name singular of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is one name for the three of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second passage is in John 14.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Matthew, it is the Triune God in name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in John 14, it is the Triune God in person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In John 14:16-20 Jesus said that He would ask the Father to give the disciples another Comforter, who would be the Spirit of reality coming to be with them and in them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then He said, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you" v. 20 . The speaking here is simple, but the content is very mysterious and excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's asking the Father to give the disciples another Comforter implies that He was the first Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The two Comforters are one person in different stages.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first Comforter was Christ in the flesh in the stage of His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He comforted His disciples, but this comforting was outside of them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord walked, lived, and ate together with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was among them and with them, but He was not yet in them and they were not in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit was not yet at that time John 7:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His resurrection He became the second Comforter in the stage of Christ as the life-giving Spirit, the stage of His inclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the day of resurrection, Christ was glorified to be the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the life-giving Spirit He could be in the disciples and they could be in Him.</S>
