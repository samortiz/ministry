   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT MERE TEACHING, BUT GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians think that what is mainly needed on the human side is teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yes, in chapter four Paul does mention shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the concept here is altogether different from the religious concept in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christianity has become a religion of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No other religion in the world has as many doctrines as Christianity has.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consider how many books are put out by Christian writers every year.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Surely no other religion can equal it in the number of books published annually.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most of these books merely feed the desire for doctrinal talk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, most of these books are related to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because someone favors a particular practice, he writes a book in order to advocate it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul s concept in Ephesians 4 is absolutely different from the concept in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The basic concept in this chapter is that of growth until we all arrive at a full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As all mothers know, growth of children comes by feeding, not mainly by teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we all arrive at a full-grown man, we shall no longer be children spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the human side the main need is not doctrine; it is growth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to grow until we arrive at a full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to become a full-grown man so that we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Notice that here Paul does not speak of every wind of heresy or false doctrine, but of every wind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such teaching may include sound, fundamental, scriptural doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, even this kind of doctrine may be used by the sleight of men in craftiness with a view to a system of error.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Any teaching, even a scriptural one, that distracts believers from Christ and the church is a wind that carries them away from God s central purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Teachings that distract us from God s economy are instigated by Satan in his subtlety with the sleight of men, in order to frustrate the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The teachings systematized by Satan cause serious error and thus damage the practical oneness of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If this matter were not serious, Paul would not use so many strong terms to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Doctrine may be likened to a baited hook used to catch fish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ignorant of the hook, the fish go for the bait and are caught.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In like manner, many Christians have been lured by the bait of doctrine, only to be caught on the hook concealed within it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because many of the Lord s people are ignorant of the hook inside an enticing doctrine, they have been systematized by the enemy in a very subtle way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, Who is the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul does not say that we shall grow up into the knowledge of Bible doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the contrary, he says that we shall grow up into Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that what is needed on the human side for the fulfillment of God s economy is growth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only by growth shall we be no longer children who are carried about by every wind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>FEEDING, EATING, AND DRINKING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Growth comes through feeding and through eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Apart from this process, it is impossible for anyone to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, what we need today is not the mere teaching of doctrine; it is the feeding with processed spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to feed others with the riches of Christ that we have cooked and processed in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way others will receive nourishment and be able to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the religious concept, the members of the church need to be regulated through teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the concept in God s economy is that God s people mainly need to be fed by having the riches of Christ ministered to them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Daily my wife serves me nourishing food.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason, I am strong, healthy, and full of energy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not need my wife to teach me; I need her to feed me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is the same in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What we need is not more teaching, but more of the riches of Christ dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can testify that throughout the years the saints have grown through being fed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Growth takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Change produced through regulation, on the contrary, comes very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, a new believer may be taught how he should dress or cut his hair.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This, however, would produce mere outward change, change without any growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The change produced by genuine growth needs time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, you can make an artificial flower in an hour, but it takes months to grow a real flower.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What the church needs is the feeding that produces the genuine growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such feeding does not come from mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have pointed out that Christianity is a religion of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The so-called Sunday morning services in Christianity are filled with the teaching of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The meetings in the Lord s recovery must be completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead of teaching doctrine, we need to minister nourishment to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to feed them with the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this way the saints will gradually grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I thank the Lord for all the feeding that has taken place in the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only in a few instances have certain ones become preoccupied with doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This preoccupation has caused great loss both to them and to others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Most of the saints have not been interested in acquiring mere doctrinal knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Instead, they have appreciated the feeding which has nourished them and made them strong.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In all the churches in the Lord s recovery we need more feeding with the riches of Christ and less teaching of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I can testify that I have no interest in doctrinal discussion and no appetite for it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When some ask me questions about things such as absolute grace, eternal security, the mode of baptism, speaking in tongues, or various views of the rapture, I simply have no desire to talk about these things in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>My only desire is to minister the riches of Christ to the saints so that they may grow in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A BOOK OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Have you ever noticed that in the book of Revelation there is no emphasis on doctrine?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>By contrast, this book speaks of the sevenfold, intensified Spirit, that is, of the seven Spirits burning before the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Revelation also speaks of the seven stars, the seven lampstands, the tree of life, and the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is nothing about absolute grace or eternal security.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Actually, the Bible as a whole is not primarily a book of doctrine; it is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should come to the Scriptures not primarily to learn doctrine, but mainly to be nourished by the living bread.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to be like the prophet Jeremiah who said, Thy words were found, and I did eat them Jer 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Let us drop the doctrines and the ordinances and concentrate on nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we do this, we shall eventually arrive at a full-grown man and no longer be those carried about by winds of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If someone comes to you with doctrinal questions, perhaps you should read him Ephesians 4:14.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Those who want to discuss doctrine under the guise of having fellowship may be influenced by the cunning craftiness of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Remember to beware of the hook concealed within the bait.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>PROPER NOURISHMENT AND GENUINE GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should try our best not to become involved in discussions over doctrine, especially as we contact new ones or visit Christian meetings in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Furthermore, we should certainly not criticize others according to a doctrinal standard.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Instead of talking about doctrine, we should enjoy Christ and minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the Lord s way in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In the recovery what we need is not doctrine, but the proper nourishment that leads to genuine growth.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Let us beware of Satan s subtle use of doctrine to distract us from God s economy, and let us pay attention to feeding, nourishment, and growth.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is the need in the Lord s recovery today.</S>
