   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CONSTITUTION OF ALL AGES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In his wisdom Paul touched the real problem of the practical Body life the matter of the self-despising ones considering themselves inferior to others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many of you still hold the concept that you are inferior to others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moreover, some of the older ones think that they are out-of-date.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although they may not say this, such a subconscious thought is nonetheless within them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As you know, throughout the years my burden has been to promote the young people and to raise them up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This has caused some of the older ones to think that they are no longer needed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, they have become deeply disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some of the older ones have said, "I have been in the Lord's recovery from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now it seems that, according to Brother Lee's concept, all the older ones are through.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He will not use the older ones on his team.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot learn the languages to go to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In particular, we could never learn Hebrew to go to Jerusalem to have the church life there in preparation for the Lord's coming back."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of this feeling of disappointment, some of the older ones consider themselves as only good for retirement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, so many of the older ones are still eager to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, some older ones are disappointed; on the other hand, many older ones are still eager to be trained to be useful in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Body is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The young people are not the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, they are simply part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is difficult for the older ones to contact young people on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I, an elderly person, were to go to the campuses, the young people would not be interested in talking to me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>People gather together according to age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, it is difficult for a child of twelve to play with a child of five.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The five-year-old would prefer to associate with those of his own age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same is true of the twelve-year-old.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, the older ones are not useful for going to the campus to contact young people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Body, however, is not composed only of young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the older ones are not suitable for work on the campus, they are the ones to bear the burden to pray for the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, it would be very difficult for the young people to stay home and pray, because they are eager to get on the campus and contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The matter of praying for the work on the campuses is a function of the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I use this one illustration to point out that the Body is not composed of just one class of people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the contrary, it is a composition of many age groups.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The young people should be strong and aggressive to work on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the older ones need to be very exercised to pray for the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, the older ones can invite all the young laborers to their homes for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if the older ones gossip and complain about being useless, our situation will be pitiful, and we shall not have the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But I believe that many will say, "Praise the Lord for raising up so many young people!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord is using them for the work on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us pray for them and let us do certain practical things to help them."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If this is the situation, the whole Body will be moving toward the goal of gaining this generation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In all of the meetings, including the meetings of the ministry, all the saints need to exercise together.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are indifferent or dissenting while I am speaking, it will be difficult for me to speak, and my speaking will be weakened and lack weight.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, if you exercise yourself to function as a member of the Body and use your spirit and your whole being to participate in my speaking, my speaking will be strengthened and become weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It will not simply be the speaking of the mouth, but the speaking of the Body.</S>
