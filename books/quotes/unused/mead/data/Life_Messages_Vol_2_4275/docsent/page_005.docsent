   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MEETING FOR TEACHING AND PREACHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First of all, you must study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then it would be good for the churches to have training meetings, a "teaching and preaching" meeting where people can hear the truths of the Bible in an atmosphere of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If this is held on the Lord's Day mornings, relatives and friends can be invited, and eventually others also will be encouraged to come.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This meeting is not for the shallow gospel, but for the broadened gospel, covering a span from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a meeting will be a place where your acquaintances can come and hear the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I believe this way is based upon the principles in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The apostles in the book of Acts just preached and taught the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How does this differ from what Christianity practices?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First of all, their sermons often do not give the real truth from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Secondly, they usually have hired, professional preachers, teaching the laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thirdly, their teachings are all too often without much reality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our intention is not to have two or three brothers do all the preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All of us must be the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not too much to say that we must all be apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Apostle does not refer to a position; it simply means sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"As the Father has sent Me, I also send you" John 20:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord was speaking to all the disciples when He said this, not only the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every believer, then, should be a sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you go to your parents to speak for God to them, you are a sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then, when you speak for God to them, you become His spokesman or prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is it that you speak?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the good tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This makes you an evangelist as well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When some people receive the gospel and become believers, you take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means you are a shepherd too.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may even shepherd your parents, if they receive the word you spoke to them as an evangelist and as a prophet when you were God's sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Finally, you may teach them from Genesis 2 about the tree of life and the woman built up from Adam's rib.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you are all faithful like this, within a few years the whole town may be turned to Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us love the Lord and come to Him to fellowship with Him by reading His Word and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Day by day live this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You will have experiences of Him and also learn the teachings with the enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then gather for the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this meeting not just a few leading ones should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The elders take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must all do what the elders do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whatever they speak, you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You follow and learn from them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such meetings will be attractive, convincing, and subduing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way you will get the proper knowledge and enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will lead to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Among your neighbors and friends will be some who will see your way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They will notice that you have the truth and know how to speak, preach, and teach.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Behind the scenes pray for a few of them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God will answer your prayer; He will move according to the tracks you have laid for Him in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no need to arrange and organize some program.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Lord's recovery all we need is the Triune God and the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can take Him in through the Bible, and we can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the way we live.</S>
