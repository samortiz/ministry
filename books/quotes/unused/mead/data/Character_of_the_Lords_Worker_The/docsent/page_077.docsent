   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul told us not only how he maintained his integrity, but also how he worked with his two hands to supply the needs of his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This shows us the principle of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul said, "These hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me" Acts 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No worker will be depleted by giving.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we keep all that we have received and only make provisions for ourselves, we do not know the meaning of the work of a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If there is little offering from the purses of the co-workers, something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a worker can only receive, that is, if his faith is exercised only to the point of his receiving, but does not extend to his giving, his function is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brothers and sisters, our spiritual future has much to do with our attitude towards money.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The worst attitude we can take is to gather only for ourselves and to do everything for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems a hard task to ask the Levites to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet the Levites have just as much responsibility to tithe as everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is true that the Levites had no inheritance in all the cities; they sojourned among the twelve tribes and lived by the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some Levites might have been tempted to say, "I live by the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What do I have to give?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But God said that all the Levites should receive tithing and should also tithe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This stops all the servants of God from saying, "I have given up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do I still have to offer from the meager income I receive?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If our eyes are always on our own needs, we will end up in financial straits and will not be able to supply the needs of our co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to learn to give.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must be able to supply all of our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we keep money in our hands, no matter how little it may be, and if, at the same time, we expect God to constantly work on the other brothers and sisters, we will find that God does just the opposite; He will not entrust His money to our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul's words in 2 Corinthians 6:10 are wonderful: "As poor yet enriching many."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here was a brother who really knew God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Seemingly he was poor, yet surprisingly he enriched many.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, this is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we work in a place and the brothers and sisters there have something to say about us, or if they have a wrong attitude towards us, we should maintain our dignity as workers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should never accept their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, we should tell them plainly, "I cannot take your money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have things to say about me, and I cannot use your money.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a servant of the Lord, I have to maintain God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I cannot use your money."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even in extreme poverty we have to learn to give.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we want to receive more, we have to give more.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we are able to give, the more we are able to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Often when we are in lack, we should give more, for as soon as the money that we have goes, the Lord's supply comes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some brothers and sisters have many such experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They can testify that the more they give, the more they receive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not count how much is left in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord said, "Give, and it will be given to you" Luke 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot annul God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Christian way of stewardship is different from that of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The world gains by saving; we gain by giving.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may be poor, but we can enrich others.</S>
