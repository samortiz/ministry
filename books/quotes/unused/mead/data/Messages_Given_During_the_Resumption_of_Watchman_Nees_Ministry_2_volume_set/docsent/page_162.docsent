   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The New Believers' Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another matter we have to take care of is the edification of the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have been Christians for over thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more we go on, the more we are clear about the things that a Christian ought to have.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are many basic truths that every Christian ought to know, such as rising up early, reading the Bible, praying, consecration, dealing with one's past, dealing with money, meeting, singing hymns, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are fifty to sixty items of truth that every Christian ought to know.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We workers have a bad habit: We do not like to repeat any message that we have preached before.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We always hope that the manna will be different every day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In conducting the basic trainings, not only must we be strict regarding the topics, but we must pay much attention to checking on the practice of the new ones and overseeing them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the co-workers have to be living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are not living, we will produce something like the Common Prayer Book, which is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to make our service truly church service, everyone has to be living, and everyone has to take up some responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The matter of serving the Lord is a Body matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As such, everyone has to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we exhort others to serve, yet we have no work for them to do, our exhortation becomes impractical.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must give everyone something to do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the whole church is working, no one will be idle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>E. A Model of the Work</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that the church in Shanghai can be opened up for others to come and personally observe the way the work is conducted here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They can come and see how new ones are brought in and how they are being sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that in the future we can see something spiritual established both in Shanghai and in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We expect to see that after a certain point everyone will be a priest, and everyone will aggressively preach the gospel and care for the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>F. Migration</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The matter of migration depends on how much the brothers and sisters have learned the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If they have learned the lessons properly, they can migrate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, we have to help the new ones to serve both in business affairs and in spiritual affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these must be something practiced by the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to know how to deal with the new ones, and we have to know how to send these new ones out.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not do this, we will not know how the other churches are doing, and we will not know whether they are doing well or not doing well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if we do this, we will help the other churches, instead of just criticizing them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is our hope.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the same time, we hope that these brothers who are sent out will have the same footsteps and will set up a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who are willing to join us can join us, and those who are afraid are free to go.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not enough to be recovered to the churches in the first century in doctrine only.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to offer up everything we have for God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today, unless we are fully brought back to the beginning in our living and our practice, we are not doing any meaningful work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We ourselves must first be brought back.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The co-workers must consecrate themselves, and the brothers and sisters must also offer up their careers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This kind of consecration has to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to produce a group of Christians who are different, who glory in offering up everything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to be such a kind of standard Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can those brothers and sisters who are in their jobs serve God in an absolute way?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to do this, the co-workers must first consecrate themselves in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only when the co-workers are absolute in their consecration can such consecration be wrought into the other working brothers and sisters.</S>
