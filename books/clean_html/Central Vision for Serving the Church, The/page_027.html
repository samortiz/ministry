<h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS OF GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION<br />
BEING THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT FOR US TO LIVE BY HIM</h2>
<p>This is not an easy message to receive, because Christians are always encouraged to pray for others. When we pray for others, however, there often is a strong element of ourselves in our prayers. Furthermore, when we are zealous, there often is a strong element of ourselves in our zeal. Even when we love the Lord and care for the church, there often is a strong element of ourselves in our love and care. We may do many things, but we still do them in ourselves. Although we may awake from a state of spiritual stupor, there may be no difference in our condition; that is, when we are in a stupor, we are in ourselves, and when we are awake, we are still in ourselves. God&rsquo;s salvation is not a matter of whether we are in a stupor or whether we are active. God&rsquo;s salvation is a matter of living by Him in the spirit.</p>
<p>If we live by Him, we will discover that He does not talk much, nor does He have the same &ldquo;concerns&rdquo; that we have for others. He even does not see the defects of others or pray for them as much as we do. Often we are more zealous than the Lord. Once, when the elders in Manila wrote and told me of a great need, I did not feel that their cry for help was according to the Lord&rsquo;s urging. This is not too much to say, because the only thing that matters is living by the Lord. When we write a letter, for example, we must check to see whether our urge to write the letter is from the Lord. We need to be delivered by the Lord; God&rsquo;s salvation is for us to live by Him.</p>
<p>When we do not live by the tree of life, we are living by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Living by the tree of life does not mean that we should not pray for others or that we should pray for others. Nor does it mean that we should not care for others or that we should care for others. Living by the tree of life means to live by the Lord. According to our experience, when we live by the Lord, we do not have many opinions, our concern for others is not based on seeing their shortages, and we are not anxious. One of Satan&rsquo;s tactics is to cause us to be anxious by stirring up our feelings.</p>
<p>A person who lives in the spirit is calm, poised, and not anxious; he is not anxious for himself or for others. He knows how to take the Lord as his life and how to live by the Lord. Since the Lord knows every situation, there is no reason to be anxious. A person who really lives in the spirit will often say, &ldquo;O Lord, this is Your business. I do not need to be anxious about it. Everything is in Your hand.&rdquo; This is the attitude of a believer who lives in his spirit. To live in the spirit is to live by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM THE MIND<br />
AND TOUCHING THE SPIRIT IN A SIMPLE WAY</h2>
<p>Some people are very good at being a Christian; they are cautious and proper, but they do not know how to touch their spirit. Every spiritual matter that they encounter is a matter of calculation; that is, they do everything according to a formula. As a result, they are completely in their mind and do not touch their spirit.</p>
<p>We do not need to calculate and follow formulas; we need to practice touching our spirit in a simple way. By calling upon the Lord&rsquo;s name, we can be delivered from our mind. If we called on the Lord&rsquo;s name for three hours, we would be delivered from our mind and would enter into our spirit. If we called upon the Lord&rsquo;s name, we would be saved from our mind because genuine prayer is in the spirit. Without turning from our mind to our spirit, it is not possible to pray for more than a short period of time. We may be able to use our mind to study the Bible, but we will not touch spiritual things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FORGETTING PAST EXPERIENCES<br />
AND FLEEING INTO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Many of us have been elders and co-workers for many years, but we still do not know how to touch our spirit. Instead, our spirituality is quite rational and formulaic. This is our problem. We should count the things that were gains to us as loss, suffer the loss of all things, and count them as refuse (Phil. 3:7-8). We should flee from our past experiences into the spirit. Our past experiences can keep us from living in our spirit today. Even though we may have been in our spirit yesterday, we may not be in our spirit today. If we try to apply spiritual experiences from our past to our living today, it will not be profitable. We must let go of past experiences and care only for living in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING NOTHING EXCEPT LIVING BY THE LORD</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation is for us to live by Him. He lives, and we also live. The Lord lives in us, but ninety percent of the time we live out our own works. Our sanctification, pursuit, quietness, and calling are just our works. The Lord has imparted Himself into us; He does not want us to do anything other than live by Him. Hence, we should simply live by Him.</p>
<p>When we get up in the morning, we should live by Him. For example, we may be diligent to practice morning watch, but if we do not touch our spirit, our practice will be out of ourselves. Our morning watch should come out of the Lord, not out of ourselves. When we see the vision of the Lord living in us, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I give myself to You. I want to let You live, and I also want to live by You.&rdquo; Nevertheless, it is easy to return to our old ways. When we arrive at a meeting, for example, our habit of giving a message may influence us to speak more than we should. Hence, we need to be reminded that the Lord is living in us, and we should yield to the Lord in order to live by Him. We should not remain in our old ways.</p>
<p>Our God is the living Spirit who lives in our spirit. Living by Him and walking according to the spirit are our only need. If we rely upon set ways and practices, we will think that our need is to find new methods, especially when we sense the oldness of our current habits. Rather than finding another way, we simply need to live by the Lord. We do not need to consider how to pray, because He will lead us to pray when we are in our spirit. The more we pray in spirit, the better it will be, and rivers of living water will flow spontaneously from us. The Lord is living in us. Hence, we do not need methods. The Christian life is not a work; it is a living. The Lord lives in us. When He prays, we pray, and when He lives, we live.</p>
