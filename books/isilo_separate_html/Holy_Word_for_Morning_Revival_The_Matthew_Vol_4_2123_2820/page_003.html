There was a man, a <sup>1</sup>householder, who planted a <sup>1</sup>vineyard and put a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower; and he leased it out to <sup>1</sup>vinedressers and went abroad.</p> <p>34 &nbsp;And when the time to harvest the fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the vinedressers to get his fruit.</p> <p>35 &nbsp;And the vinedressers took his slaves and <sup>1</sup>beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</p><p>37 &nbsp;Then later he sent to them his <sup>1</sup>son, saying, They will respect my son.</p> <p>38 &nbsp;But the vinedressers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, <sup>1</sup>This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and take possession of his inheritance.</p><p>40 &nbsp;Therefore when the master of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?</p><p>41 &nbsp;They said to Him, He will miserably <sup>1</sup>destroy those evil men and will lease the vineyard to <sup>2</sup>other vinedressers, who will give the fruit to him in their seasons.</p> <p class="bold">42 &nbsp;Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures, &#8220;The <sup>1</sup>stone which the <sup>1</sup>builders rejected, this has become the <sup>2</sup>head of the corner. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes&#8221;?</p><p class="bold">43 &nbsp;Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a <sup>1</sup>nation producing its fruit.</p><p>44 &nbsp;And <sup>1</sup>he who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces; but on <sup>2</sup>whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>33<sup>1</sup> The householder is God, the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem (Isa. 5:1), and the vinedressers are the leaders of the Israelites (v. 45).</p><p>35<sup>1</sup> This was the persecution suffered by the Old Testament prophets (Jer. 37:15; Neh. 9:26; 2 Chron. 24:21).</p><p>37<sup>1</sup> This is Christ.</p><p>38<sup>1</sup> This statement indicates that the Jewish leaders, wanting to maintain their false position, envied Christ because of His rights.</p><p>41<sup>1</sup> This was fulfilled when the Roman prince Titus and his army destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</p><p>41<sup>2</sup> These were the apostles.</p><p>42<sup>1</sup> The stone is Christ, who is for God&#8217;s building (Isa. 28:16; Zech. 3:9; 1 Pet. 2:4), and the builders are the Jewish leaders, who should have been working on God&#8217;s building.</p><p>42<sup>2</sup> Christ is not only the foundation stone (Isa. 28:16) and the topstone (Zech. 4:7) but also the cornerstone.</p><p>43<sup>1</sup> This is the church.</p><p>44<sup>1</sup> This is a person who stumbles on Christ; referring in particular to the unbelieving Israelites (Isa. 8:15; Rom. 9:32).</p><p>44<sup>2</sup> These are the nations, the Gentiles, that Christ will smite and break into pieces at His coming back (Dan. 2:34-35). To the believers Christ is the foundation stone, the One in whom they trust (Isa. 28:16); to the unbelieving Jews He is the stone of stumbling (Isa. 8:14; Rom. 9:33); and to the nations He will be the smiting stone.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>At the end of this parable, the Lord Jesus not only indicated that the kingdom would be taken from Israel and given to the church; He also referred to God&#8217;s building.</p><p>The church is the life-pulse of the kingdom. This means that just as the body dies when the pulse stops, so the kingdom is wholly dependent upon the church. The church, in turn, is completely dependent upon the building. If there is no building, there is no practical church life. The church life is not simply a matter of meeting together or of having a little fellowship. In whatever locality we are, we need to be builded. For this, we must enjoy and experience our Christ as the stone....In Him and through Him we are built together.
