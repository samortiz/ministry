   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>BEING GOD S FULLNESS Scripture Reading: Rev 21:11; 4:3; 22:1-2; 21:23; 22:5; Rom 8:30, 17-18, 21; 1 John 3:2 OUTLINE The New Jerusalem being the ultimate manifestation of the fullness of God: The light of the New Jerusalem being the effulgence of God s image Rev 21:11; 4:3: The New Jerusalem being filled with God s life, with what God is 22:1-2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Jerusalem being filled with God s light, God s expression 21: 23; 22:5.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The entire New Jerusalem being God s fullness, the ultimate expression of the riches of all that God is.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Jerusalem being the aggregate of God s redeemed, matured, and glorified people throughout the ages, the ultimate expression of the riches of all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE REVELATION OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>CONSUMMATING IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this chapter we will continue the line of God s fullness in order to see the ultimate manifestation of the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The sixty-six books of the Bible contain many items, and in the last two chapters of the Bible the New Jerusalem appears as the conclusion of the development of these items.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The structure of the New Jerusalem is simple because it has only three materials: gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The city itself is a mountain of gold; the entire city is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The city has four sides, and each side has three gates.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The twelve gates are twelve pearls Rev 21:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The wall of the city is precious stone, and the twelve foundations of the wall are adorned with twelve precious stones vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the city has only three kinds of materials: pure gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Throughout the last two thousand years, since the completion of the New Testament, many Bible students and scholars have spent much time and effort to study the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are many different views and opinions concerning this city, and there have been endless arguments and diverging opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the past decades we thoroughly studied most of the different teachings concerning the New Jerusalem, and we have seen that the New Jerusalem is not a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE NEW JERUSALEM BEING A SIGN,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>NOT A PHYSICAL CITY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entire Bible contains the divine revelation and reveals God s economy, His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible also reveals God s person, showing that God is triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, it reveals the process and the goal of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After unveiling these precious things, the Bible concludes with a city in Revelation 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This city of pure gold has a wall of precious stones and gates that are pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition, the length, breadth, and height of the city are equal; hence, it is a cube.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can the consummation of the divine revelation in the Bible be a physical city?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the New Jerusalem were a physical city, it would not bear much significance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The book of Revelation is a book of signs 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Signs are used to express deep thoughts that cannot be described in words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first sign in this book is the golden lampstands v. 12 . These are not physical golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are a sign that illustrates the nature and function of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church should be of gold, completely divine, and it should shine brightly in the dark.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the golden lampstands are a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Another sign is the Lion-Lamb 5:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the Lamb, He is our Redeemer, and as the Lion, He fights against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the eyes of God, Christ is the Lamb of God for our redemption, and He is the overcoming Lion to defeat God s enemy and bring in God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are more than ten signs in the book of Revelation, and the last sign is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Revelation 1:1 says, The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is presented in this book is mainly in signs rather than plain words.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In chapter 1 the seven churches are not spoken of in plain words; instead, seven golden lampstands are used to show the condition of the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we see the golden lampstands, we understand the condition of the churches, because a picture is better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is simple to describe something with a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is difficult to give an accurate description of a person by describing his appearance, features, and demeanor, no matter how many words we use.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The simplest and clearest way to give an accurate description is to present a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The book of Revelation mainly uses signs to present its revelation, not plain words.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to this principle, the New Jerusalem cannot be a physical city; it must be a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The revelation in the Scriptures is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The ultimate issue of this revelation appears at the end of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If this ultimate issue was presented in plain words, thousands of words would not be adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is very wise and uses one great sign, a city, to show the ultimate consummation of the divine revelation.</S>
