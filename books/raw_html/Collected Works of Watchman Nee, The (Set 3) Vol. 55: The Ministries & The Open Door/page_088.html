<h2 class="head2">A Conference in Huaian (Kiangsu Province)</h2><p>While I was staying in Zhenjiang, I received a letter from the brothers in Huaian in northern Kiangsu province, saying that they had several brothers with a heart to serve the Lord. They invited me to visit and give them instruction concerning the way to serve the Lord and the kind of responsibility they should bear. I mentioned their request to Brother Ji and elderly Brother Wu, and they also felt that I should see the situation of the brothers in northern Kiangsu. Therefore, I went to Kiangsu on July 2. When I arrived in Huaian, there were some brothers and sisters waiting for me.</p><p>God arranged all the circumstances, and the brothers in Huaian gathered all the brothers who had a heart and who were already bearing responsibility in the localities around Huaian. In the conference the brothers and sisters were stirred up to consecrate themselves to the Lord and to learn to serve. I will probably be able to return to Chenchiang on or around July 20.</p><p>Chiu Ri-jien<br />July 16</p><p>Mailing Address: 31 Sifu Street, Zhenjiang, Kiangsu</p><h2 class="head2">Praying for a Building (Nanchang, Kiangsi)</h2><p>The brothers and sisters who migrated to Nanchang have all been well, and the Lord has really graced us.</p><p>Our meetings are free, and people get saved when we preach the gospel. More than ten have been saved this year, and many lost sheep have been brought home to rest. The rented meeting hall can seat only about ninety people; it cannot accommodate everyone. We are praying daily for a house.</p><p>It has been very difficult to find jobs for the brothers. But we are going on positively to find a solution. Our car's engine is being changed to a charcoal-burning engine, and we hope it can be finished soon. (It has been finished.&mdash;Editor) Our finances are very tight, but the Lord always gets us through the difficult situations. (According to the most recent news, many of these difficulties have already passed.&mdash;Editor)</p><p>Fan Chih-kuang<br />June 28, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 13 Loboshi, Nanchang</p>
