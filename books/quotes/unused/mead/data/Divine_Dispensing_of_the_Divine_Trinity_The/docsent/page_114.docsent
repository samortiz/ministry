   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Word of Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first manifestation of the Spirit listed by Paul is the word of wisdom, and the second is the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word of knowledge may be somewhat ordinary; it is not necessarily a word directly concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, the word of knowledge may include the things related to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Someone speaking a word of knowledge may speak of the parable in which the shepherd left the ninety-nine sheep and sought after the one sheep that was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a word is not a word of wisdom; it is a word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to study the Bible to learn the truths of the gospel and the truths of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This will make us knowledgeable and equipped to speak in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This will also give us utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Utterance is related to our knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not have the knowledge of the truth, we may be able to shout forth some praise to the Lord, but we shall not have the utterance to speak of salvation or the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the saints need more knowledge of the truth and more ability to present the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the reason I have encouraged the leading ones to consider having a short time of training in the truth regularly after the prayer meeting and also after the Lord s table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During this period of training, perhaps only a half hour in length, we can learn the truth and also practice presenting the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For instance, a brother may give a brief word in which he presents the truth of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may know the truth concerning justification, but we still need to know how to present this truth to others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a matter of utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Utterance equips us to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we have much utterance that comes from knowing the truth, we shall be able to speak for hours concerning the biblical truths.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Faith</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the first two gifts, the word of wisdom and word of knowledge, Paul mentions certain miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To a different one faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing in the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Faith here is like the faith that can remove mountains, as mentioned in 13:2 and Mark 11:22-24.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Gifts of Healing</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 9 Paul also speaks of gifts of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the miraculous power for healing different diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Works of Power</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 10 we have yet another miraculous gift operations of works of power.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This refers to miracles, works of miraculous power other than healing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>An example would be the case of Peter raising Dorcas from death Acts 9:36-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I can testify that I prefer the gift of speaking the word of knowledge and the word of wisdom to the miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I admit that I do not have the kind of faith that can move mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, I can speak the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a result of my study of the Scriptures, I can speak on many different subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To me, the most precious gifts are the gifts to speak a word of wisdom or a word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The miraculous gifts may stir up people s curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But what people need is a word of wisdom to know Christ or a word of knowledge to know how to go on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose that through the exercise of the gift of healing someone is healed of cancer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although people may be excited by such a miracle, there may not be a genuine, long-lasting spiritual result.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the reason the Lord Jesus did not commit Himself to those who were attracted by signs: Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, when they saw the signs which He did.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men John 2:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord did not commit Himself to those who were looking for miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their persistent seeking after miracles eventually caused the Lord to go away from them.</S>
