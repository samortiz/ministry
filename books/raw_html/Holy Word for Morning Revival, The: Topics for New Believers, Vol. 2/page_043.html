<ol class="decimal">
<li>The Son of God has come to sow<br />
Himself, the seed of life, in man,<br />
That thru Himself God&rsquo;s Kingdom grow<br />
And thus fulfill th&rsquo; eternal plan.</li>
<li>He was the only grain of wheat<br />
Whence many grains have been produced<br />
To be the Kingdom&rsquo;s children meet,<br />
Thru whom God&rsquo;s reign is introduced.</li>
<li>But Satan, enemy of God, <br />
Sowed many tares among the wheat,<br />
The Kingdom&rsquo;s children to confuse,<br />
And awful damage to create.</li>
<li>&rsquo;Tis by this subtle work of his,<br />
The mixing of the tares with wheat,<br />
The Kingdom in appearance is<br />
Abnormal and grotesquely great.</li>
<li>The Kingdom should as mustard be,<br />
A little herb, yet good for food,<br />
But it has changed into a &ldquo;tree,&rdquo;<br />
A system of great magnitude.</li>
<li>Instead of being good for food,<br />
A lodge of &ldquo;birds&rdquo; it has become;<br />
&rsquo;Tis now a place where evil men<br />
And evil spirits make their home.</li>
<li>A great religion of the world<br />
Its outward form to us reveals,<br />
Including pagan, evil things,<br />
As leaven mingled with the meal.</li>
<li>A system of the world as such,<br />
It thus has changed in outward form;<br />
By evil things which it imbibes,<br />
Corruption inwardly doth swarm.</li>
<li>But something hidden God doth seek,<br />
As &ldquo;pearl&rdquo; and &ldquo;treasure in the field&rdquo;;<br />
As such the Lord would us transform<br />
That pearl and treasure be revealed.</li>
<li>&rsquo;Tis hidden from vast Christendom<br />
And from the Kingdom&rsquo;s great fa&#231;ade,<br />
Yet in its full reality<br />
&rsquo;Tis transformed like to Christ and God.</li>
<li>Lord, separate us from the &ldquo;tares,&rdquo;<br />
And save us from the monstrous &ldquo;tree&rdquo;;<br />
From all the &ldquo;leaven&rdquo; purge us now<br />
That we may purely be of Thee.</li>
<li>May Thou in life transform our souls<br />
That we as precious stones may be,<br />
Meet for Thy house to build and in<br />
Thy Kingdom&rsquo;s full reality.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3u">Hymns, #947</h2>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>God&rsquo;s Kingdom today is a real exercise,<br />
But when Christ comes to reign it will be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a great prize;<br />
It is wisdom divine that we now may be trained<br />
That His plan be fulfilled and His justice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintained.</li>
<li>God&rsquo;s children, we&rsquo;re born to be kings with <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Son,<br />
And we need to be trained that we may overcome<br />
And to know how to rule in His Kingdom as kings,<br />
That His kingship thru us be expressed o&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all things.</li>
<li>Today we must learn to submit to His throne,<br />
How to have a strict life and His government own;<br />
His authority then we&rsquo;ll be able to share,<br />
O&rsquo;er the nations to rule with God&rsquo;s Son as the  heir.</li>
<li>With a life strict to self we must righteousness  hold,<br />
Kind to others in peace, and with God joyful, bold;<br />
In the Kingdom&rsquo;s reality e&rsquo;er to remain,<br />
For its manifestation prepared thus to reign.</li>
<li>Then Christ when He comes with the kingdom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from God<br />
Will to us grant His kingship to share as reward;<br />
Thus the Lord will His righteousness thru us  maintain<br />
And His wisdom to heavenly powers make plain.</li>
<li>For this the Apostle pressed on at all cost,<br />
For the Kingdom assured that he would not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be lost;<br />
&rsquo;Tis for this he charged others, Be true to the Lord,<br />
That the Kingdom might be unto them a reward.</li>
<li>O Lord, give us grace for Thy Kingdom to live,<br />
To be trained that Thou may the reward to us  give;<br />
Make the Kingdom&rsquo;s reality our exercise,<br />
That its manifestation may be our great prize.</li>
