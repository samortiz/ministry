   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PHILIP S PREACHING IN THE CITY OF SAMARIA Manifested to Be an Evangelist</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acts 8:5 says, And Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Philip was not the Philip among the apostles 1:13 , but the Philip among the seven appointed by the apostles to serve tables 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But through his ministry in preaching the gospel as recorded in chapter eight, he was manifested to be an evangelist 21:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Philip s preaching Christ in Samaria was a further step in the Lord s evangelical move.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By this He spread Himself as the seed of the kingdom of God from the racially pure Jews to the mixed Samaritans for the fulfillment of His prophecy in 1:8.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to 8:4 and 5, among the saints who migrated from Jerusalem was at least one who was an evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Philip took part in this migration, and he had an outstanding gift of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of this gift, he was eventually called Philip the evangelist 21:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Preaching Christ and the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning Philip s gospel preaching, 8:12 tells us that he brought good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Philip preached Jesus Christ as the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 12 bringing the good news is a verbal form of the noun gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Philip preached Christ as the good news; he preached Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, he preached Christ, and Christ was his gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Acts 8:12 also indicates that Philip preached the kingdom of God as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He preached the kingdom of God as the gospel just as the Lord did Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Like Philip, we should preach the gospel that is Jesus Christ and also the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In fact, we should preach Jesus Christ as the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The kingdom of God is the Lord Jesus, the Savior, as the seed of life sown into His believers, God s chosen people Mark 4:3, 26 , and developing into a realm which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Its entrance is regeneration John 3:5 , and its development is the believers growth in the divine life 2 Pet 1:3-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The kingdom of God is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live Rom 14:17 , and it will develop into the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward Gal 5:21; Eph 5:5 to the overcoming saints in the millennium Rev 20:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God s eternal life for all God s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity Rev 21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a kingdom, the kingdom of God, is what both the Lord Jesus and Philip preached as the gospel, the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Gospels the Lord Himself was the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Acts we see the spreading of this seed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In particular, this seed spread through Philip s preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today much of the gospel preaching among Christians does not include the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we must preach a gospel that has Christ as the content and also has Christ as the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to experience Christ not only as our Savior and as our life but also as the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we received Christ, we received a Savior, a life, and a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we should live a kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we shall know how to preach the kingdom of God as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Certain preachers today are eloquent and know how to stir people and inspire them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In their speaking these preachers may use stories and illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if you examine the content of their messages, you will find that there is very little of Christ or the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our preaching of the gospel must be different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to preach a high and rich gospel with Christ as the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In our preaching we should have Christ not only as the Savior and as life, but also as the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am happy that Luke pointed out in his narrative that Philip preached the gospel concerning Jesus Christ and the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although Luke did not give the details of Philip s preaching, he does tell us that Philip preached Christ and the kingdom of God as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This should be a pattern for our gospel preaching today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE SAINTS BRINGING THE GOOD NEWS OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have seen that according to 8:4, those who were scattered went about the land bringing the good news of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have seen that this verse contains the pattern of the saints migrating for the spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we need to consider another pattern found in this verse the saints bringing the good news of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Filled with the Lord s Word</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Among much of today s preaching there is little of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead of the word, there are stories and illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our speaking should not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, we need to learn the word in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to study the New Testament and be saturated with it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are saturated with the New Testament in this way, when we open our mouths to speak the word will come forth spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There will not be the need to use so many stories and illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should simply give people the word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>People may be entertained by a preacher s stories and illustrations, but they may not receive much of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the poverty of a great deal of today s teaching and preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We in the Lord s recovery should be full of the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Life-study Messages do not contain many stories, but these messages are full of the rich Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The saints do not receive help from stories; they receive help from the solid, divine word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Word That Conveys Christ and the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As we go forth for the spreading of the gospel, we should go with the gospel of Christ and the kingdom in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only the divine word can contain and convey Christ and the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The teachings of Confucius certainly cannot convey Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Such teachings cannot be vessels to convey Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only the holy word, the divine word, is useful in conveying Christ as the kingdom of God to others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we sow the word into others, we also sow Christ into them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>According to the Gospels, we cannot separate Christ from the word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ is the seed, and the seed is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, we need to be filled with the word and sow it into others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this message we have seen some crucial points concerning our preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The content of our gospel must be Jesus Christ and the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Furthermore, we need to preach Christ and the kingdom of God in the word and with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In order to preach Christ and the kingdom, and even to preach Christ as the kingdom of God, in this way, we need to be very familiar with the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need to be filled and saturated with the divine word in the New Testament.</S>
