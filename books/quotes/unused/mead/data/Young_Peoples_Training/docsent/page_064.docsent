   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN SIX TESTS OF A GENUINE LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the past several messages we have covered the reality and practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the church is one in substance, one in existence, and one in manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is one substantially both universally and locally.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apart from God, nothing in the universe is more one than the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is an entity of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE UNIVERSAL AND LOCAL ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is one universally and locally.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is just one church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Universally, the church is one in existence, and locally the church is one in manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church in the universe is one, and the church manifested in a locality is also one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord s word, Upon this rock I will build my church Matt 16:18 , is related to the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following this, in Matthew 18 the Lord spoke about the manifestation of the church in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If two or three cannot solve a problem themselves, they should tell it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This certainly is not the universal church, but the church in the locality where those believers live.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the four Gospels the Lord mentioned the church twice, once for the universal aspect and once for the local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE CLEAR PICTURE IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the book of Acts the church is not mentioned in a universal way, but in a local way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Acts 8:1 speaks of the church at Jerusalem, not the church in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 13:1 speaks of the church in another locality, the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know from Revelation 1:11 that there were seven churches in seven cities in Asia Minor: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Churches were also raised up in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, there was a church in Corinth 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is clearly portrayed in the Bible that the church is universally one in its existence and locally one in its manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Wherever the church is, it is always one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although there is just one universal church, in the many cities there are the many local churches, with one church in each city.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A PICTURE OF DIVISIONS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although the picture regarding the church in the Bible is clear, the history and present situation of Christianity give us another picture a picture of divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead of one church in a locality, there are numerous divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But according to the Bible it is wrong to say that there are many churches in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is against God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What are called the many churches in a locality are actually divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Using other terms, we may say that they are denominations, sects, groups, or organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is what we see everywhere in Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we stand here as the church in Anaheim, some say that we are merely another division.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They claim that our coming here simply added another to the list of divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Someone might say to you, I am a pastor of a certain group in this city.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have heard that you people say that you are the church and that we are not the church, but rather are Babylon or organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I don t agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Am I not a real Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I was reborn before you were born.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since we all are Christian brothers, why do you say that you are the church and that we are not the church?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It seems to me that you are simply another Christian group.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You have added yourselves to the number of churches already in this city.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why did you come here?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why don t you go to a place where there is no church at all and be the unique group there?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why do you come here to trouble us?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to answer questions like these, we must know what constitutes a sect, a division, or a denomination.</S>
