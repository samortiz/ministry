   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DETAILS CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HIGH AND DREADFUL WHEELS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us now proceed to consider a number of details concerning the high and dreadful wheels.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Wheels Being at the Side</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>of the Faces of the Living Creatures</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The wheels were at the side of the faces of the living creatures Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that if we would have the Lord s move, we must first live out the Lord, expressing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we live out the expression of Christ, we will have the wheel of the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Wheels Being upon the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 15 we are told that the wheels are upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not expect that the move of the Lord will be in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has angels to carry out His move in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What He needs is a move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God needs a move in the United States and in many other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Wheels Having the Appearance of Beryl</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 16a says, The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of a beryl.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Daniel 10:6 beryl was the appearance of the Lord when He was moving.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that within the move of the wheels is the appearance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Wherever the wheel goes it brings the appearance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the wheel moves to a certain place, it will bring the appearance of the Lord to that place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a wheel is with you at school or at work, it will bring the Lord s appearance there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Others will be able to see the beryl, the appearance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Wheels Having the Same Appearance</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 16b says, They four had one likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here we are told that all four wheels have the same appearance, the same likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that the move of the Lord has the same likeness and appearance in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the moves bear the same appearance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the likeness of all the wheels is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the church in one locality has a likeness, an appearance, which is different from the likeness of the church in another locality, something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The saints in a particular church may think that they need to build up their own local distinction, that they need to build up something typically and uniquely local.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is contrary to Ezekiel 1, where we are told that all four wheels bear the same likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not think that the wheel moving in the United States should bear one appearance and that the wheel moving in other countries should bear a different appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In every place and in every country the wheel must bear the same appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This does not mean that all the churches should follow one particular church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, all the local churches should be mutual followers of one another 1 Thes 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Wheels Going in Four Directions</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The wheels went on the four sides in four directions not turning as they went.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates a move in coordination, without any turns.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Wheels Being Dreadfully High</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ezekiel 1:18a says, As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here I would point out that we should never try to make ourselves great; instead, we should be little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, the wheel beside us should be so high that it is dreadful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In our locality we should not have a small wheel only a few inches in diameter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the contrary, in our city there should be a high wheel, a wheel that is dreadfully high and that will surprise others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The wheel in every church should be so high that it is dreadful.</S>
