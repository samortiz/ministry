<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Ao Nei</H2><P>The meeting in Ao Nei is ten miles from Lee Chia Ching. There used to be a few brothers under a certain denomination. Brother Su T'i Sheng read The Christian and was enlightened. In his heart there was a battle because he deeply felt that the Holy Spirit could not work with them there because of the many errors in the particular denomination. However, the denomination did not have bad leaders. The brothers who bore the responsibility in the denomination, Lin Li Ming and P'an Tu Ch'i (Brother P'an passed away the year before last), were humble seekers of the truth. In the winter of 1929, these few brothers left the denomination in one accord and then the Holy Spirit moved their hearts to have some prayer meetings in Ao Nei for a few days. The Holy Spirit worked with them, and it seems that many of the sisters and brothers who heard the Word were saved. Now there are more than twenty brothers and sisters who meet together to break bread in remembrance of the Lord in the afternoon. Great opportunity was provided in their morning meeting for the preaching of the Word. Every year there are newly saved ones added to them. Lin Li Ming and Lee Hua Min have their own gifts. In the matter of giving, apart from the expenses of the meeting, they follow the direction of the Holy Spirit and give alms to the poor or meet the needs of the workers. This is a brief description of the work to date. May the Lord bless them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Chen Hsia Kuan</H2><P>Chen Hsia Kuan is a place on the coast. It is about fifteen Chinese miles from Ao Nei. A few brothers used to worship in Ao Nei. In 1931 the brothers built three other buildings here in one accord. Now there are several dozen meeting. They preach the Word in the morning and remember the Lord in the afternoon. Three brothers, Wu Tze Chien, Lee Hsi Ming, and Ling Yu Ju, do business on the one hand and bear responsibility for the meeting on the other. The rest of the brothers and sisters are all obedient to the truth and are in one accord. There is no barrier among them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Locality of Fu Ting</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Condition of the Meeting in Fu Ting</H2><P>Fu Ting belongs to Fukien province. It is about sixty miles from Ch'iao Tun Men. There is a brother, Wu Shou Liang, who used to be in that city's Episcopalian Church. His family had not believed in the Lord. He ran a dye factory. In the winter of 1928, his eldest son Wu Cheng Chung heard the Word in the meeting in P'u Men and was saved. Then he brought a few brothers to his house, and Wu Shou Liang's wife and his aunt were saved. Brother Wu began to pursue the truth with a true heart and understood the error of denominations, so he left the Episcopalian denomination of his own accord and began breaking bread in his home (there were four people). The co-working brothers would go to his home from time to time for meetings to help them. In the past six years they have been attacked from all sides by the devil and have suffered greatly. But the Lord's grace is with them; to this day they still stand. Now new brothers and sisters have joined them to hear the Word in solidarity. The two Wus (father and son) are responsible. (They lack the gift of speaking.) On the Lord's Day there is a morning meeting to preach the Word and a table meeting in the evening. I (Yu T'ing) went to their house twice last year and stayed with them for a total of five weeks, and by the Lord's grace rendered some help to them. I feel they are very isolated and need the constant presence of the Lord's grace so that they may go on. They also need the Lord to add saved ones to their meeting. This is what we ask for. (Unfinished.)</P><P>Your brother in Christ,<br>Wang Yu T'ing<br>January 15, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM WU CH'ANG, HUBEI PROVINCE</H2><P>(This is a letter from Mr. Liu Ai Wu of the Hua Chung Seminary in Wu Ch'ang. We have not seen this brother before, but from his letter, we know something of his heart. We will pray for him.)</P><P>Dear Brother Yueh Ch'iao:</P><P>I received and read your postcard at the end of 1933. I had already thought about writing you and asking you the dates of the next conference, but I was entangled by my flesh and did not get around to it until now. Thank the Lord, He is overcoming! Although Satan's authority is everywhere, the Lord released me through the power of Golgatha! Glory and honor and authority to Him forevermore! Amen.</P><P>Since the Lord's Spirit enlightened me to see the sin of denominations and the corruption of organization, I have felt very hungry and thirsty for the Lord within, but because I am a milk-drinking child, my spiritual life is very weak. I thought that every child who was enlightened by God would have the same experience. I wanted to wait until a so-called "comrade" was raised up for me and then leave the system. To tell the truth, I was afraid of the loneliness of the way of the cross! Did I not know that "constricted is the way..., and few are those who find it"? Unfortunately, I was foolish in spirit and did not obey God earlier!</P><P>During the summer vacation the Lord prepared a way for me to go to Shanghai and called me to go. My spirit wanted to accept the Lord's arrangement, but the flesh was still weak; I actually followed my flesh and went home. The local group of this denomination wanted me to "use a reed for a weapon." I also followed my flesh to go work. In those two months, the suffering of failure was too much for words. May all this shame be upon myself! Thank God, He showed me the result of not obeying! After the summer vacation I still went on in the way of error and went back to Wu Ch'ang as usual. The Lord loves me to the uttermost. Although my flesh is weak, He has continuously enlightened me, disciplined me, and supported me with His power.</P><P>When I saw the news that you were going to have a meeting over winter vacation, my spirit was desperate for this matter! But I did not know to use the cross to deal with my flesh, and Satan still had the opportunity to hinder me! I asked you to send The Present Testimony and Notes on Scriptural Messages to my home in Ch'ang Teh. My wife read them and then sent them on to me. She usually sent them immediately after reading them, but this time, she did not send them until January 2. I did not know that you were meeting on the twenty-first. However, the Holy Spirit gave me special enlightenment; I suddenly felt within that I must decide on the matter of going to Shanghai. On the one hand, school did not let out for vacation until the twenty-fourth. How could I have handled this temptation? It seems that it would have been hard to put it aside! With this one thought, I quenched the leading of the Holy Spirit! On the twenty-fifth, I read a classmate's copy of The Present Testimony. At first I was very happy. Then I saw the dates at the end and was disappointed. I looked at the newspaper for steamer times. There were ships leaving on both the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth. I prayed earnestly before the Lord. On the next day I fasted and prayed, but God did not give me an "answer." I only saw the work of Satan!</P><P>Praise God! Christ always overcomes! Although the enemy hindered my steps, "the Lord made my steps light!" I did not follow my flesh to return home this winter vacation. I did some writing for the school and had an opportunity for quietness so I could review an important lesson He had given me&mdash;The Spiritual Man. It released my spirit and brought me more into the experience of having my flesh dealt with by the cross! I used to demand that God fulfill "my" desire to graduate from the seminary. Now my prayer is, "God, I am willing to obey You and follow Your way of the cross. May Your will be done in me." Since the Lord's word has separated my soul from my spirit, I can only place my soul in a position of death. I only have one more year until I graduate. According to the flesh it is a shame because I will miss success by a very narrow margin. I may even meet with opposition from many people. However, I am willing to follow the Lord's calling and give it up! I ask the Lord that I may be able to boast in His cross! Amen.</P><P>School will be in session in a short time. I am waiting for God's will. If He allows me to go to Shanghai, I will meet all the brothers, and we can remember the Lord together. Please pray earnestly for me, asking the Lord to lead and prepare a way that I would escape the hands of those who do not obey! Is Mr. Nee at home? I hope that he can also read this letter and pray for me!</P><P>Finally, brother, is there anything else I should pay attention to besides what was published in the last issue of The Present Testimony? I hope you can answer my letter immediately! May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you always! Amen.</P><P>Liu Ai Wu<br>February 8, 1934</P>
