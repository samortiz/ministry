   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you know where we are today?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are where the Son is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may say that we are in the Son with the Father and also in the Father with the Son.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The life brings us the reality, the reality is the way, the way is one with the destination, and this destination is God and the Father Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who fear and honor God but do not believe in the Lord Jesus would have to testify that they never have had the sense that God is in them and that they are in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, they may realize that they are sinful and that they have the problems with the world, Satan, and other negative things.</S>
