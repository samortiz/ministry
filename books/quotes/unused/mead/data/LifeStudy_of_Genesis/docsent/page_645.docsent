   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>14 Taking the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 41:45 we see that Joseph took as his wife Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Joseph's wife was a heathen, an Egyptian.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Joseph took her during the time he was rejected by his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This also is a type portraying how Christ has taken the Gentiles as His wife during the time of His rejection by the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As He was staying with the Gentiles, He obtained a wife from among them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the book of Genesis we have seen three wives who portray the church: Eve, the wife of Adam; Rebekah, the wife of Isaac; and Asenath, the wife of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the wife of Adam, Eve portrays how the church comes out of Christ and is a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She typifies how the church is the same in life and nature as Christ and eventually becomes one Body with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, Eve typifies the church being a part of Christ, coming out of Christ, returning to Christ, and being one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rebekah portrays the church as the called and selected one, the one from the same source as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaac came from a particular source, and Abraham's servant was sent to that source to select and call a wife for Isaac and to bring her to him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This selected one was Rebekah.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Asenath portrays the church taken out of the Gentile world by Christ during His rejection by the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During the time of this rejection, Christ came to the Gentile world, stayed there, and received the church out of the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of his wife, Asenath, Joseph begot two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The name Manasseh means, "Causing to forget."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Manasseh was born, Joseph said, "God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house" 41:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that with the birth of Manasseh Joseph forgot all his afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Manasseh was born, Joseph seemed to say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has caused me to forget my afflictions."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This reveals that when the church is productive, Christ will declare that He has forgotten His afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If in the gospel meetings of the church in Anaheim some fruit is produced, Christ will declare to the whole universe, "Manasseh!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have forgotten My affliction."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The name of Joseph's second son was Ephraim, which means "Fruitful" 41:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Ephraim was born, Joseph said, "For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With Joseph, instead of affliction, there was fruitfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we preach the gospel and produce fruit, Christ will be happy and declare, "There is no more affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But look at all the fruit!"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>15 Supplying People with Food</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Joseph supplied food to the famished people 41:56-57 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As such a supplier of food, he typified Christ as the One who supplies people with food John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today, what a Supplier of food Christ is!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He supplies food to the famished people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we read the story of Joseph, we find that it is inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although we may read it again and again, we cannot exhaust its riches.</S>
