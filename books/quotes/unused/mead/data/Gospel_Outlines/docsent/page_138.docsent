   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus the death of the Lord Jesus fulfilled the righteous requirement of God.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The power of the gospel is based on God s life The gospel of God not only contains God s righteousness but also God s life.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Believe that the Lord Jesus died and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The death of Jesus takes away our sins, fulfills God s righteousness, and gives us His righteousness.</S>
