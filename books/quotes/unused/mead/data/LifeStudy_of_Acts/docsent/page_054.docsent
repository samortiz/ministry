   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE NINETEEN THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN JERUSALEM, JUDEA, AND SAMARIA</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PETER S COMPANY 14 Scripture Reading: Acts 6:1-7</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall consider 6:1-7.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 6:1-6 we have the appointment of seven serving ones, and in verse 7 we see the growth of the word of God and the multiplication of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE APPOINTMENT OF SEVEN SERVING ONES A Problem in the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 6:1 says, But in these days, when the disciples were multiplying, there was a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were overlooked in the daily dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Hellenists were Jews who spoke Greek, and the Hebrews were Jews who spoke Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the very beginning of the practice of the church life, there was trouble caused by different languages.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Proper care was taken to solve this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Often there are problems in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These problems are not caused by outsiders but by those in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first problem recorded in Acts was caused by a couple, Ananias and Sapphira, who were ambitious and dishonest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That problem was solved by God s sovereign judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From this we see that we may not need to do much about certain problems in the church, for those problems are taken care of by the Lord s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, in chapter six of Acts we have another kind of problem the problem of language or of race.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apparently the problem in the church at Jerusalem was a problem of language related to those who spoke Hebrew and those who spoke Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, this was a problem not mainly of language but of race.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We know from Acts 2 that Jews had come from their dispersion to Jerusalem to keep the feast of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who had been dispersed among other races gradually came to speak the languages of those races.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, when they came to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of Pentecost, they were not able to speak Hebrew but spoke their native languages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In particular, the Hellenists spoke Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The difference of language became a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, the source of the trouble was not language but race.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If all of mankind were of one race, there would probably be just one language.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Different languages are the result of different races.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Genesis 11, the source of this problem was Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From experience we know the problems that are caused by the different languages among those in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, among those saved through our gospel preaching on the island of Taiwan were those who spoke a number of different languages, including the local dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We certainly suffered from the problems caused by different languages.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we first came to the United States, we did not carry out a work among the Chinese-speaking people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, because it became possible for so many Chinese-speaking people to emigrate to this country, it became necessary to have a work among the Chinese-speaking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord has blessed this work very much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We thank the Lord that although we have among us those of different languages and races, we do not have a problem concerning language or race.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are thankful to the Lord for His mercy and for all that we have learned in the past related to this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We praise Him that race and language are no longer a problem!</S>
