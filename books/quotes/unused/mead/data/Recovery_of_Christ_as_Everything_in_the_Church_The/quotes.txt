[1]  The Recovery of Christ as Everything in the Church CONTENTS
[2]  To have Christ living in us means that we are crucified with Him and that it is Christ who lives in us.
[3]  Christ is revealed into the believers, Christ lives in them, and Christ is formed in them.
[4]  In the latter part of the first century, while the apostles were still on the earth, two main things crept into the church to replace Christ Judaism and Greek philosophy.
[5]  Because many things have replaced Christ, the Lord s recovery is to recover Christ in a full way, to recover Christ as everything to us.
[6]  CHAPTER TWO THE RECOVERY OF CHRIST AS LIFE Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 29; 12:24; 14:16-17; 7:39; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17; 2 Tim 4:22; 1 Cor 6:17; Eph 3:16-17, 19; 1 Cor 12:12-13
[7]  Christ, who is the focus of God s eternal purpose, said that He is the way, the reality, and the life John 14:6 .
[8]  Before becoming our reality or our way, Christ must first be our life.
[9]  In this chapter we will consider how Christ can be our life.
[10]  Some oppose the truth that Christ became the life-giving Spirit, saying that it is a heresy to say that Christ, who is the Son of God, is the Spirit.
[11]  The Spirit of God existed before Christ s resurrection, but the Spirit that includes Christ s humanity was not yet.
[12]  The picture of the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30 shows that besides the humanity of Christ, His death and His resurrection have also been added to the Spirit.
[13]  The olive oil being compounded with these four spices typifies the Spirit of God being compounded with Christ s death, the sweetness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection.
[14]  The Spirit of Christ is the reality of Christ, the resurrected Christ.
[15]  We have been put into Christ by being baptized into Him, and now we are taking Christ into us by drinking Him as the Spirit.
[16]  In this chapter we will consider our experience of Christ as the reality as revealed in 1 Corinthians.
[17]  First Corinthians 3:11 says, Another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[18]  Christ is the foundation of the church, and He should also be the foundation of our life.
[19]  If we do not have Christ, our life has no foundation.
[20]  When we receive Christ, take Him as our person, and begin to live Him, we have a foundation.
[21]  We were formerly under God s condemnation, but Christ became our Passover so that God would forgive us and so that His condemnation would pass over us.
[22]  CHAPTER FOUR THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST BEING THE WAY Scripture Reading: John 14:6; Heb 10:19-20; Matt 3:13-17; 1 Cor 1:22-24; 2:1-4; 2 Cor 4:10-12; Phil 3:10-11
[23]  Christ said, I am the way and the reality and the life John 14:6 .
[24]  In the two preceding chapters we saw how Christ becomes life and reality to us.
[25]  Christ first becomes life to us, then reality, and lastly the way.
[26]  We must have Christ as our life in order to participate in Him as our reality.
[27]  In 1:22 through 24 he says, Indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[28]  In Christ s resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[29]  This type was fulfilled when the Spirit of God was compounded with Christ s death and resurrection.
[30]  We have a dying Christ within us, and this dying Christ is the ingredients of the life-giving Spirit.
[31]  If we are identified with the crucified Christ, He becomes our way our way to live the Christian life, to worship God, to enter into God s presence, to take care of the church, to shepherd the saints, to preach the gospel, and to be a proper husband, wife, son, or daughter.
[32]  The arrangement of the tabernacle and its furniture in the Old Testament is a picture showing how we as saved sinners can enter into God s presence to enjoy God as our everything.
[33]  CHAPTER FIVE THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22; 1 Cor 11:3; 12:28; Matt 20:25-28; 23:8, 10; 1 Pet 5:3; Heb 13:17 CHRIST BEING QUALIFIED TO BE MADE
[34]  In Old Testament times the headship of Christ was not completed, because Christ had not yet become a man.
[35]  When Christ came, the devil knew that Christ was the Son of God coming as the Son of Man in order to bruise the head of the serpent Gen 3:15 .
[36]  However, if we do not realize that Christ is our Head and practice the headship of Christ, it is difficult to take Him as our life.
[37]  In order to have all the areas of our life fully attuned to the proper, normal way, we must see that Christ is our Head and practice the headship of Christ.
[38]  We are short of the experience of Christ simply because our position is not proper as a result of our not regarding Christ as our Head.
[39]  If we say that Christ is the leader, the person may not understand or accept our answer.
[40]  We need to answer strongly that in the Lord s recovery we have no leader other than Christ.
[41]  CHAPTER SIX THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS Scripture Reading: Col 1:12, 15-19, 27; 2:2-3, 6-9, 16-17, 19-23; 3:4, 10-11 THE CHURCH NEEDING
[42]  The tabernacle in the Old Testament was a full and complete type of Christ Exo 25:8-9; John 1:14 .
[43]  As branches in the vine, if we simply live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ, fruit will spontaneously come forth from the life within.
[44]  As we live Christ, speak Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ, we will spontaneously bear fruit.
[45]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE TRANSMISSION OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:27; 2:6; 3:11, 16; John 6:63 CHRIST BEING OUR ALL-INCLUSIVE PORTION
[46]  Because Christ is the unique person in the new man, Paul said, To me, to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .
[47]  Instead of living our old person, we need to live Christ, taking Christ as our person.
[48]  DAILY CONTACTING THE LORD THROUGH THE WORD BEING A LIFE NECESSITY
[49]  Because the word in the Bible embodies God, Christ, the Spirit, and life, we Christians need to come to the Bible daily and even hourly.
[50]  The experience of the all-inclusive Christ as our portion and the transmission of Christ through the word and the Spirit are the way of life ordained by God in His economy.
[51]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE PILLAR AND BASE OF THE TRUTH Scripture Reading: John 1:17; 8:32; 14:6a, 17; 17:17; 1 Tim 2:4; 3:15; 4:3; 2 Tim 2:15, 18; 3:8; 4:3-4 THE CHURCH NEEDING TO BE
[52]  In the church life we need to pay our full attention to life and truth, or reality, which are both Christ Himself.
[53]  In John 14:16-17 Jesus said, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality.
[54]  Christ, who is the reality, was the first Comforter.
[55]  Because Christ is reality v. 6 , the title the Spirit of reality refers to the Spirit of Christ.
[56]  The Spirit is the person of Christ, the reality of Christ.
[57]  Similarly, when we call on the Lord s name, we receive the Spirit, because the Spirit is the person of Christ.
[58]  In addition to reading the Bible to learn the doctrines, we need to open to the Lord to see the truth, praying, Lord, I need Your enlightenment, revelation, and vision so that I may see the reality in every doctrine.
[59]  As the pillar and base of the truth, the church should stand firmly, bearing all the reality the reality of life, light, power, holiness, salvation, redemption, and many other items.
[60]  Christ to us is not only the objective Christ in the third heaven but also the subjective Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit to be wrought into every corner and avenue of our inward being.
