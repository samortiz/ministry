   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF GOD BROODING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OVER THE DEEP TO PRODUCE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then there is another and in this verse, indicating that something more happened: "And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Hebrew word for moved means brooded or hovered, as when a mother bird broods over her eggs to bring forth life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that after God's judgment God did something to bring forth life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The situation was really waste and void, and there was darkness upon the depth of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the Spirit of God came in to brood, to hover, over the situation in order to produce life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Following this, from Genesis 1:3 to the end of chapter two, there is a long record of how life was brought forth through the brooding of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These two chapters are full of striking significances.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every detail of these two chapters has some significance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should not merely read the letters in black and white; rather, you must know the significance of what you read.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Genesis 1:2 we read about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the significance of the Spirit here?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Bible the Spirit always signifies life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the significance of the waste, void, darkness, and deep water?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All these signify a disaster, and even death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These are all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then all of a sudden something good came, that is, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit came not to rebuke, not to condemn, but to brood, as a mother bird broods over the eggs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The "eggs" are just the waste, void, darkness, and deep water.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are all terrible things, yet these terrible things came under the brooding of the "mother hen"; hence, they all became "eggs."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also were under this brooding.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are out of Adam, and Adam was out of the dust, which was there under the brooding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The dust, which is the earth, was the first thing that came out of the brooding of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, there was the Spirit; then, after the Spirit there was light vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3-5 ; and after the light the firmament was made vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>6-8 , which is the air.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the resurrection of the buried earth came up on the third day, the day of resurrection vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the first thing that came up because of the Spirit's brooding is the resurrected earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Adam was made out of this earth, and we are a part of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, we came out of the brooding of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our existence came out of the Spirit's brooding in God's history.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God firstly came out of eternity and entered into time by creating the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then God's creature rebelled, and God judged him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This rebellious one became God's enemy, and the entire universe became waste, void, and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then God moved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He moved by the brooding of His Spirit, and we are included there under that brooding.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The brooding brought forth the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But for the earth to produce life, there is the need of light and air.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, on the first day the light was recovered, and on the second day the air, the firmament, was created.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then on the third day, the day of resurrection, the buried earth came up typifying the buried Christ resurrected , ready to produce life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The producing of life started from the lowest life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is a sequence of life in Genesis, beginning with the lowest life, the life without any consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First, we find the grasses, the herbs, and the trees vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These are living things, but their life is very low and without any consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These were created on the third day, immediately after the earth resurrected from the death water.</S>
