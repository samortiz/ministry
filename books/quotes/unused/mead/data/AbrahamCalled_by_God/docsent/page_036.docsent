   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When God appeared to Abraham in 15:1, He said, "Fear not."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's saying this to Abraham indicates that Abraham was fearing his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God seemed to be telling him, "Abraham, you don't need to fear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am your shield.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am also your exceeding great reward."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Abraham, still being in an elementary stage at the time, was concerned about two things: that his enemies might return to fight against him and that he still had no child of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Abraham might have said, "Look at me I am old.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Look at my wife she is nearly out of function.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We still don't have a child.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, don't You know we are getting old in years?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When will You give us a child?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When God appeared to him, Abraham was concerned about these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the presence of God we cannot hide our intention.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are given the opportunity, we shall sooner or later utter whatever is in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, in 15:2 Abraham said, "Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the son of possession of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The next word that Abraham spoke to the Lord was not very polite.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He said, "Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, a son of my house is mine heir" 15:3, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Abraham seemed to be saying, "Lord, I go childless because You have never given me a child.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must bear the blame for this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why do I go childless?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because You have never given me a child!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now You come to tell me that You are my great reward.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What's the use of Your giving me a reward if I have no child?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Abraham told the Lord that a son of his house, who was Eliezer of Damascus, would be his heir.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Darby's New Translation the footnote says that "a son of my house" means "one of his domestics."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that Eliezer must have come from Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It might have been that when Abraham was passing through Damascus he obtained him there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>None of us has ever answered God's call in a clean-cut way; we all dragged our feet through mud and water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Abraham even suffered two deaths, the death of his elder brother, Haran, and his father, Terah.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, Abraham answered God's calling, being unable to avoid it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He left Haran, where he had been called the second time, taking Lot along with him, and passed through Damascus where he picked up Eliezer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord appeared to Abraham, saying that He was Abraham's shield and great reward, Abraham seemed to say in reply, "Lord God, I go childless because You have not given me a child.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The one whom I intend to have as the heir and possessor of my house must be my domestic servant, Eliezer."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord said to Abraham, "This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir" 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord seemed to be saying to Abraham, "I didn't care for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Neither do I care for this one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There must be a seed born out of yourself, not one of your domestics."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then the Lord said to him, "Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be" 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was at this juncture that Abraham believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 6 says that "he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Abraham's believing was counted to him by the Lord as righteousness, and at that time Abraham was justified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Abraham's having a seed was absolutely not an outward matter but altogether an inward one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Abraham tried to make this an outward matter, for Eliezer was something outside of him, not something out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to see the difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today, not many Christians care for the inward experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Most Christians care for the outward experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The things that are taught among Christians today mostly go as far as the end of Genesis 14.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some may argue with this, saying, "Don't they have justification by faith, and is this not in chapter fifteen?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yes, they do have justification by faith, but even this has been made by them an outward thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Abraham was not justified by faith in chapter fourteen when he believed that God was the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God did not count that kind of faith to him as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What kind of faith was it that was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was the faith that believed that God was able to work something into him to bring forth the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Believing that God will supply our daily needs, our daily food, is good, but it is not the kind of faith that is precious in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What kind of faith is precious in God's sight?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The faith that believes that He is able to work Himself into us to bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Most Christians today only care for the faith that believes that God can do outward things for them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That kind of faith believes that God is able to give them health, healing, a good job, or a promotion.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many Christians only have that kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although that kind of faith is good, it is not the faith that is so dear and precious in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He did not count that kind of faith as righteousness to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The kind of faith that was counted as righteousness to Abraham was the faith that God was able to work something into him to bring forth a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Genesis 15 Abraham did not believe that God would give him bread and butter, cattle, or more servants.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He believed that God was able to work something into him and bring forth a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What kind of faith do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Most Christians appreciate the faith that believes that God will provide all they need for their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That is the faith that believes in God as the Most High God, as the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Perhaps you are thinking that you would be satisfied to have such a faith as that.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After reading the last message, you might have tried to believe in the Most High God, believing that our God is the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But that faith is not the faith that is so dear and precious in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to have the faith that believes that God is working Himself into us, the faith that believes that a heavenly seed will be brought forth by something that has been wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May this matter be inscribed into our being!</S>
