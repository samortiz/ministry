   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Nothing touches the Lord s heart as much as the recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is His recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord desires to recover the church life that He may have a people who have come out of every division, that He may have a place for His name and for His habitation, and that He may have the Holy of Holies in which and from which to speak to His people today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE TOP TENTH ENJOYED ONLY IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that the top tenth of the harvest had to be kept separate, brought to the unique worship center, and enjoyed there with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the Israelites could enjoy the remaining ninety percent of their harvest at any time and in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We in the Lord s recovery can testify from our experience that we always have something of Christ to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Daily we are nourished and illuminated by the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Daily we enjoy the riches of Christ, the ninety percent of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But no matter how rich is the enjoyment of the ninety percent, it cannot compare with the enjoyment of the top ten percent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This enjoyment is found only in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The children of Israel went to Jerusalem three times a year for the feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we feast in the meetings of the church at least three times a week.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not like to miss even one church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No matter how much I enjoy the Lord at home or in other places, this enjoyment can never replace the enjoyment I have in the meetings, where we eat the top portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you want to taste this top portion?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then do not stay at home, for you can never enjoy it there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Come to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>COMING TO THE MEETINGS FILLED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose, however, that no one in the church labors on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When they all come together in the meetings, they will be empty-handed, without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This does not mean that they do not believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It means that they have not experienced Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, they have no wheat, barley, wine, figs, pomegranates, or olives.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the brothers and sisters may have their Bibles and hymnals, they have no harvest of Christ in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, nothing of Christ comes out of their mouth in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, they sit there like a flat tire and wait for a certain brother to deliver a message.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of meeting is pitiful; it is a return to the old tradition of a speaker and an audience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praise the Lord that the church in Stuttgart is not like this!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So many of the saints in Stuttgart are full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not just have the Bible in their hand they have Christ in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, in the meetings there is an abundance of wheat, barley, and the other items of the riches of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What a wonderful meeting it is when the brothers and sisters stand up one by one to testify of their experience of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>EXHIBITING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THROUGH THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the church meeting is to be living and filled with Christ, the testimonies should not drag on and on.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such slow, dragging testimonies kill the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all must do our best to release the spirit so that Christ may come forth to nourish the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we do this, we enjoy the top portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since we all have something of Christ, let us come together to exhibit Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the children of Israel gathered at Mount Zion, they brought their tithes together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although each Israelite might not have had very much, there must have been a heap of firstfruits when all the tithes were put together.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, there was an exhibition of the rich produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, we need to put our riches of Christ together and exhibit them in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to have such an exhibition of Christ, we must do three things: first, we must have the harvest; second, we must come to the unique place God has chosen, not to a place of division or confusion; and third, when we come to the church meetings, the unique place, we must release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you give a testimony in the meetings, do not relate your personal history in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The saints do not want to hear your history; they want to eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They want to enjoy Christ out of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Long testimonies filled with details about your personal history will simply put the brothers and sisters to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Two years ago in Taipei we held a conference attended by more than nine thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to give as many as possible the opportunity to testify, the elders decided to limit each testimony to twenty seconds.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because the attendance was so large, a microphone was used for the testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the end of twenty seconds, the microphone was turned off, and the one speaking could not continue.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nearly everyone was caught.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But they received an excellent training.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you testify, forget the unnecessary details.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Simply say, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is my life and my light.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How sweet He is, and how good He is to me!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This morning my wife was giving me a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the Lord strengthened me, and now I can shout, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Testimonies like this, easily given in twenty seconds, are very nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By giving this kind of testimony in the church meetings, we eat the choice portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order to eat the top portion of Christ, we must have the harvest, we must go to the unique place, and we must exercise our spirit to testify in a quick, direct way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is impossible to have the harvest overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For this, we must labor on the land.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we labor diligently, we shall eventually have a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I believe that you all love the Lord and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now the Lord is telling you that you must learn to grow Christ, to let Christ grow in you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you do this, you will have a harvest of Christ to bring to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When you are in the meeting, be prepared in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In some respects, functioning in the meeting of the church is like playing basketball.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The members of a basketball team come to the basketball court prepared to play.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even their attire indicates that they are players, not spectators.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, many come to the church meetings dressed as spectators, not as participants.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They have no intention of participating in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They are neither prepared nor equipped for this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Rather, they watch others play.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Furthermore, they may be not only spectators but also critics, judging some for using poor grammar, others for being too emotional, and still others for being too sharp.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Eventually such people are not happy with anything or anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we come to the meeting like this, it is impossible to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We are still too much under the influence of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We need to be recovered, to be brought back to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Day by day we must live in Christ, by Christ, with Christ, and for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we labor on Christ day by day, we shall certainly have a harvest of Christ to bring to the meetings.</S>
