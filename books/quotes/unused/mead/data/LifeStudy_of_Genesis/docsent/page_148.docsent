   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man's Murder of His Brother</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him" Gen 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we compare this verse with John 8:44, we learn that Cain was not the only murderer; Satan was the murderer as well.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In that passage the Lord Jesus spoke of the Devil, saying, "He was a murderer from the beginning."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although Abel was slain by Cain, Satan committed murder in Cain's act of murder.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because Cain had rejected God's way and God's warning, he was caught by Satan, the murderer, and became a murderer with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, two murderers committed the same crime.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By murdering his brother Cain became completely possessed by the Devil, for the Devil murdered Abel by Cain's hand and with his cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Cain disdained his parents' preaching and he discarded God's warning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, he, motivated by Satan, served God according to his own invention and eventually was totally possessed by Satan and became a murderer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That was the second fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second fall of man began with man's invention of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It did not begin with stealing; it began with worshipping God according to the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Worshipping God according to a manmade religion was not a rescue from the first fall, but a continuation of it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second fall, which began with a self-made religion, was completed by an act of murder.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you believe that it is possible for religious people to commit murder?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you read history you will discover that the Roman Catholic Church has killed more genuine Christians than the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thousands of Christians were killed by the Roman Empire, and the Roman Catholic Church continued this persecution, killing even more genuine believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you attempt to be a pure and genuine Christian in Portugal or Spain, you will need to be careful, for the religious people there might attempt to take your life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Human religion is always like this: it begins by serving God and it ends by killing people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This exactly corresponds to the word of the Lord Jesus in John 16:2: "An hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think that he is offering service to God."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What was the first fall of man?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first fall of man was man's taking into himself something other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man did not do anything evil; he simply absorbed into himself an element other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What was man's second fall?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The second fall of man was the invention of religion which resulted in an act of murder.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The second fall occurred because of man's presumption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Presumption means that man does not care for God's economy, for God's way, but that he only cares for his own desires and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When man refused to follow God's way, inventing instead his own religion, he eventually became a murderer of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That was the second fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is very helpful to be clear about the fall, for, as a result, we can see more of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that no one reading this message will become a Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all should be righteous Abels.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us all be like Abel, believing the gospel, practicing the gospel, and living for the gospel.</S>
