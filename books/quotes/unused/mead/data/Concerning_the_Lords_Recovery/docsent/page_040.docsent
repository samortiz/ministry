   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A BOOK OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Revelation is a continuation of what John revealed in his Gospel and in his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Gospel of John mainly reveals to us the matter of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The divine life is nothing less than the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as our life and our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The life revealed in John's Gospel is too divine, too mysterious, too high!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John's three Epistles he reveals more mysteries of the divine life such as the divine fellowship, the divine abiding, the divine anointing, the divine birth, the divine seed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the Gospel of John and the Epistles of John are on the divine life, we should not consider that the Revelation of John is different.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John was a writer who revealed the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must consider that his last book should also be on the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, the entire Bible is on the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Right after God created man, He brought him to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible begins in Genesis with the tree of life and it ends in Revelation with the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is because the entire Bible is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have covered many crucial verses in this message and the two previous messages.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If possible you had better study those verses, remember them, recite them, and pray-read them again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is better to do it each month for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>See what will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I assure you that you will see something.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are the crucial verses in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You need to eat them and digest them, taking every verse into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A CONCLUSION TO THE WHOLE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we come to the consummation of God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The book of Revelation is an issue of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the book of Revelation the entire Bible has no conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you know what is in Revelation, you could see that nearly all of the signs included in the Old Testament are here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first sign in Revelation is the lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The lampstand was mentioned in Exodus the first time Exo 26:31-40 , the second time in 1 Kings 7:49 , and the third time in Zechariah 4:2-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you don't have the book of Revelation you cannot know what is the real issue, the real outcoming, of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The last sign in Revelation is the New Jerusalem, a city built foursquare with three gates on each side.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Jerusalem was also revealed in Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the end of the book of Ezekiel there is a city by the name of Jerusalem having four sides with three gates on each side, and all the twelve tribes' names written there Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>48:31-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Between the lampstands in Revelation 1 and the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22, there are the tree of life and the manna 2:7, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tree of life was also mentioned in Genesis, and the manna was mentioned in Exodus 16.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Another item which was in the Old Testament and which consummates in the New Testament is the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John mentioned the Lamb of God in chapter one when he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The lamb was also mentioned in Genesis 22 when Abraham offered his son Isaac on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God came in and stopped him, and when Abraham turned he saw a ram which he offered instead of his son Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is also the Passover lamb in Exodus 12.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The consummation of the lamb is in Revelation 22:1, where the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are also the seven lamps in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The seven lamps and the seven Spirits of God were already mentioned in Zechariah 4.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The four living creatures in Revelation were in Ezekiel 1.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nearly everything in the book of Revelation can be found in the Old Testament because Revelation is a conclusion to the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you would understand the book of Revelation, you have to understand the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The book of Revelation is the issue, not only of John's writings, but also of the entire Bible.</S>
