<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXIX. BEING THE AIM OF THE BELIEVERS' SOWING</H2><P>The Spirit is the aim of the believers' sowing (Gal. 6:8b). Whatever we do is a kind of sowing. If we hate people, we sow the seed of hatred unto the flesh. Then we will reap hatred from others. We should not sow unto the flesh but unto the Spirit. To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish what the Spirit desires.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXX. CIRCULATING, IN HIS FELLOWSHIP,<br>GOD THE FATHER'S LOVE AND CHRIST THE SON'S GRACE<br>WITHIN THE BELIEVERS FOR THEIR ENJOYMENT</H2><P>The Spirit circulates within the believers in His fellowship. He does not circulate rumors or today's news. He circulates God the Father's love and Christ the Son's grace within us for our enjoyment (2 Cor. 13:14). This circulating is the fellowship of the Spirit. The love of God through the grace of Christ is circulated by the Spirit's fellowship for our enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXI. BEING THE ESSENCE FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>The Spirit is the essence for the organic building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:4, 16). The organic building up of the Body of Christ is altogether the total function of the Spirit in all of us. Ephesians 4:4a says, "One Body and one Spirit." Verse 12 speaks of the perfecting of the saints. Verse 15 speaks of our growth in life. Then verse 16 reveals the Spirit in the Body building up the Body through every member, that is, through each one part of the Body and through every joint of the supply. All of this is involved with the function of the Spirit.</P><P>The Spirit moves in one member to produce one kind of function and within another member to produce another kind of function. The Spirit produces many kinds of functions in the Body. Every part operates in its measure, and all the joints of supply do their work as the issue of the functioning of the all-inclusive Spirit. This is why I say that there are many, many functions of the all-inclusive Spirit. Without such a Spirit, the Body of Christ could not be organically built up.</P>
