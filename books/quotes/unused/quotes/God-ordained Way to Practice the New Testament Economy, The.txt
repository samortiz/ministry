We are not merely going to knock on people's doors, but we are going to visit people in the same way that the Lord Jesus did
He came far away from the heavens to this earth to visit people, so He also gives us the order or commandment to go to visit people
All of us need to dream about the new way for the Lord's new move so that God's New Testament economy can be carried out and practiced
Our going out to visit people by knocking on their doors is for this economy and should be linked with the divine economy
When we go out, we must hold on to the concept and deep feeling that we are going out to visit people for God's economy
Without knocking on people's doors, it would be hard for us to seek the sons of peace for God's eternal economy
We go to knock on people's doors by having ourselves linked to the divine economy, linked to eternity, linked to the heavenlies
In answering such a question, we have to differentiate between what it is to be completed and what it is to be perfected
Before Christ was incarnated, He was eternally perfect but not complete because He was still short of the human nature
If He had never passed through human living, how could He be our Shepherd, our High Priest, or our Helper, our Comforter?
It was not until the day of His resurrection that He passed through resurrection and entered into resurrection in His physical experience
He was Jesus in the form of the physical flesh for thirty-three and a half years, but He needed to be in the form of the Spirit
He passed through resurrection and came out of that resurrection to be in another form, in the form of the life-giving Spirit
We have to see that the greatest miracles are the incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection of the wonderful Jesus
On the evening of the day of resurrection, the Lord came with a resurrected body into the room where the disciples were with the doors shut
If someone asks you whether Jesus was a physical person when He appeared to the disciples in resurrection the best response is I dont know
Today, Christ is a person in ascension who has been glorified, enthroned, and entrusted with all the authority in heaven and on earth
When the heretical Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses go to knock on people's doors, they are not linked to this Christ
He told us that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth, and He charged us to go with this universal authority
You have to realize that when you go out to knock on people's doors, you are the greatest person on this earth
You are a person who is linked to the completed Christ with all the authority in heaven and on earth entrusted to you
For us Christians, the ambassadors of Christ, to go out and knock on people's doors for twenty days without one being baptized is amazing
Such an occurrence however should be normal to us because we are great persons who are linked to the completed Christ the processed Christ
We can see how God's anointed One was being completed in the four Gospels in incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection
God needed to complete Christ so that He could carry out His eternal purpose through this Christ, in this Christ, and with this Christ
Christ has gone through such a marvelous process, and today we are in the processed Christ, the completed Christ
Some have said that knocking on people's doors may work in Taiwan, but not work in other countries and areas of the world
All the authority in heaven and on earth has been given to this Christ, and He commissioned us to go to disciple the nations
In the book of Acts, the completed Christ was being propagated, multiplied; on the day of Pentecost three thousand were baptized
To knock on people's doors and to preach the gospel to them is to make them the multiplication of the pneumatic Christ
Our trainees in Taipei have the experience of being able to discern whether or not a person is a son of peace within a few minutes
The pneumatic Christ is also the economical Spirit of power to baptize the regenerated believers into one Body
In Taipei, we first set up meetings in people's homes, and then we combined three or four homes together as a group
The church is produced organically by imparting Gods completed Christ into sinners to make them regenerated and baptized members of one Body
The unsearchable riches of this processed Christ are divine, heavenly, spiritual, and mysterious, yet they are so real and practical
By enjoying the unsearchable riches of this processed Christ, we all become members of His Body, which is the church
Corinthians 12:1-12 is a portion of the Word that has been misunderstood and even misused throughout the history of the church
To understand any section or any sentence of the holy Word, one needs a complete and overall view of the entire Bible
In the last century the Brethren taught that 1 Corinthians was a book to solve the problems in the church life
They considered the portion from chapter twelve through chapter fourteen as a section on the problem of the gifts
In particular, the Brethren felt that this section of 1 Corinthians was written to solve the problem of tongue-speaking
Apparently Paul wrote this letter to solve all the problems, but actually there was a deeper thought and burden within Paul
The four Gospels tell us how God's Son has been completed to be God's Christ to carry out God's New Testament economy
Romans shows us the Christian life for the church life, and 1 Corinthians follows to show us how to have the church life
Unrestricted speaking in tongues is a great destruction to the proper church life, and it destroyed the church life at Corinth
In 1 Corinthians 12-14 Paul dealt with tongue-speaking to save the saints in Corinth from the destruction of the church life
Today on this entire earth it is hard to find the proper church life because there are not the proper church meetings
The Christian gathering is for the Divine Trinity to operate for the purpose of carrying out the dispensing of the processed Triune God
Christianity has lost the view of God's New Testament economy and has lost the view of God's ordained way to carry out this economy
God the Father operates, the Son ministers, and the Spirit distributes all the gifts for the dispensing of the processed Triune God
Even the gospel preaching is not for gospel preaching but for the Triune God to operate to carry out His divine dispensing of Himself
In most Christian meetings today God has nearly no way to operate in order to dispense Himself into His chosen people
In 1 Corinthians 12:4-6 there is a picture of the Triune God that begins with the Spirit, goes through the Lord, and reaches God the Father
With the Spirit is the distribution of the gifts, with the Lord are the ministries, and with God the Father are the operations
God the Father operates, the Lord ministers through different ministries, and the Spirit distributes Himself into the believers as gifts
In the Divine Trinity's operation, the Spirit moves the believers to say 'Lord Jesus' and distributes gifts to the believers
What a meeting that would be if all of us would function to begin the meeting by calling upon the name of the Lord
After ten times of calling on the Lord's name, we would not be able to sit down, and we would have to flow out from within
Whenever you entered into the meeting place, you had the sensation that you were alive and that everything was living there
The gifts perform all kinds of ministries by the Lord, and all these ministries will carry out the operation of the Father
The gathering of Gods people in the old dispensation was with Christ prefigured in all the types but not completed through all the processes
The gathering of God's people in the old dispensation was also with regulations of letters only and no direction and move by the Spirit
Today in the Christian meetings there must not be the regulations of letters but the direction and move by the Spirit
In the past two chapters we have seen the positive items of the divine economy and of the Divine Trinity's operation
One parable shows us that while the wheat is growing, the enemy of the Lord comes and sows tares amidst the wheat
Only about twenty percent of the members of the denomination in which my mother was a member were genuine Christians
They believe that the Lord was martyred on the cross for His teachings which were different from the Jewish traditional religion
Peter 2:1 says that such modernists are degraded to such an extent that they even deny the Master who bought them
Another parable in Matthew 13 describes today's Christendom as a great tree with great branches that become a lodging place for birds
Another parable describing the situation of Christendom is the parable of the woman who took the leaven and put it into the fine flour
The Two Babylons is a book that gives a full documentation of the deformation and degradation of this evil religious system
Pember in his book, The Great Prophecies, also points out the abominations of the apostate Roman Catholic Church
We came out of this deformed system, and the Lord led us to begin the church life for the first time in Brother Nee's hometown
We love all our Christian brothers and respect them, yet we cannot agree with the religious system they are in
The deformed and degraded Christianity has left the God-ordained way for carrying out the New Testament economy
God's New Testament economy is first to complete His Christ and then to propagate this completed, pneumatic Christ to produce the church
The entire Christianity is far away from this economy, having left the God-ordained way to carry out God's eternal purpose
Christianity is not focused on the divine economy but is a human religion saturated with demonic and satanic things
The new way that we are taking to carry out God's New Testament economy has nothing to do with formalities and rituals
The New Testament shows us that whoever preaches the gospel has the right to baptize those that they bring to the Lord
Thousands who knew nothing of Christ were baptized and came into Christendom, bringing their pagan customs with them
The brothers who went to visit this sick person all prayed one by one, and his relatives, who were also Christians, were shocked
The prevailing concept in today's Christianity is that preaching, teaching the Bible, and praying for others is the pastor's job
In the church life there should not be an annulling of others' functions but a stirring up of everyone to function
They must behave like an ordinary, little brother among all the new converts, and they have to give place to everyone
We must believe that every believer is a living one because every believer has the living God, Christ, the Spirit of life, in him
We should afford every believer an opportunity to express his living situation as a living member of the Body of Christ
The judgment upon the tares will be so serious because they have been confusing, frustrating, and damaging God's economy
If the elders in the local churches consider themselves higher than others, that is the satanic thought of hierarchy
We all have to love each other and respect one another, yet we should not consider anyone to be higher than others
Since August of 1986, twenty-four thousand have been baptized and one-third of these still remain to meet in their homes
Eventually, many of the saints began to lose their heart for the meetings, and they only had a heart to come to see each other
We should not merely ask the new ones to come to the church meetings, but we should bring the church meeting into their homes
Finally, the deformed and degraded Christianity forfeits the proper church life, not caring for the building up of the Body of Christ
There is no concern for the building up of the Body of Christ, so the divine economy is altogether dropped and missed
The Lord's new way is to recover the church life so that the Body of Christ can be built up through the church life in many localities
My burden is to open up the real situation of today's Christianity that we may know where we should go and where we should remain
We must stay away from the practice of the deformed and degraded Christianity and come back to the divine revelation for the Lord's recovery
We must come back to the biblical way, the new way, the living way, that affords God the opportunity to operate among His chosen people
The books of the Bible were written by the inspiration of God and even the arrangement of the books is also by the inspiration of the Spirit
What God needed was a completed Christ, and the first thing that God did in the New Testament was to complete His Christ
Now He is in the heavens with all His qualifications to be God's Christ, God's anointed One, to carry out God's eternal commission
The term 'the church' in Acts is not mentioned as a doctrine, a teaching, or even as a revelation, but as a practicality
The church in Jerusalem , the church in Antioch , and the churches in Syria and Cilicia are a reality in practice
The believers needed to know that the Christian life is Christ living in them and lived out of them to express Himself
Those who are enjoying the Christian life for the church life still do not know how to meet, so the book of 1 Corinthians is needed
To have a proper meeting life, we do not just need to know Christ or to have a revelation concerning Him, to see Him
God has called us into the participation of Christ, the fellowship of Christ, that is, into the enjoyment of Christ as our portion
In chapter ten Christ is the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock, out of which flows the living water
We need to call on the name of the Lord during every occupation at all times and in all places with our mouth in the spirit and in the heart
In the years from 1966 to 1968 we began to practice pray-reading the Word and calling on the Lord's name in Elden Hall in Los Angeles
When we call on these names there is no sensation of something moving within us nor is there any feeling of enjoyment
Calling on the Lord will make you happy, will take away your burdens, and will especially take away your human anxiety
If we are those who call on the Lord's name, there will be no need for us to try to think of what to say in the meeting
All the apostles' works are to carry out this unique ministry of ministering Christ to people for the building up of His Body
One of the principles of how to have proper meetings for the church life is that we must help people learn to enjoy Christ
In God's eternal economy the completed Christ is the center, the factor, for us to have Christian meetings for the church life
We must teach and lead all the new ones into the realization that they need to call on the name of the Lord whenever they come to a meeting
Neither we nor the new ones should come to the meeting silently, dumbly, without opening our mouths to call on the name of the Lord
Calling, 'Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus,' will bring life into the meeting and make the meeting atmosphere living, high, and rich
To meet together is to be gathered into the person of the Lord Jesus and to be gathered into His person means to be gathered into the Spirit
Before entering the meeting place, whenever we have the thought to go to the meeting, we should begin to call, 'O Lord Jesus'
In setting up and holding the meetings with the new believers, we must practice calling on the name of the Lord
When we come together by calling upon the name of the Lord, we are in a meeting that is a genuine Christian gathering
Corinthians is the unique book regarding Christian meetings revealing that the Christian meetings are to build up the church
In every kind of activity, whether preaching the gospel, edifying the saints, or going to the meetings, our goal is to build up the church
We build up the church in the church meetings by the Spirit's gifts, the Lord's ministries, and God's operations
The more we enjoy Him as our life supply, the more we grow in life, and the more we grow in life, the more the gift is produced
We do not go to a new believers' meeting and only teach them to pray or teach them with the Life Lessons or Truth Lessons
We must be a person who enjoys Christ daily; then as we take the lead among the new believers, they will follow us to enjoy Christ
The saints around the time of Pentecost broke bread every day, that is, they had the remembrance of the Lord by practicing the Lord's table
Acts 12:12 tells us that when Peter was released from prison, he went to the house of Mary where a group of saints were praying
The new believers will function in a small way at first, but from that point, they will continue to progress in life and in function
All of us like to start a meeting with a lot of people yet the more people you have as a start in a meeting the more trouble you will suffer
They were Christians who did not have a place to worship, so when they heard about the gathering at the meeting hall, they came
There are two kinds of meetings: small meetings in the homes of the believers and large meetings in a larger meeting place
We have two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, two lips, two shoulders, two arms, two hands, two thighs, two legs, and two feet
In the larger meeting place, we should not have any definite speaker with all the congregation listening to this speaker
In such a meeting all the attendants should participate in the building up of the church through their functions
When we come together one may have a revelation another may have a hymn another one may have a teaching and others may have another portion
They can pray, offer some praise to God, call a hymn, take the lead to sing a hymn, read the Scriptures, or give a testimony
Genesis 2 records that God put this man in front of the tree of life, indicating that this created human being needed the divine life
When we believe into Christ, He comes into us not only to be our Savior but even the more to be our life, thus fulfilling the purpose of God
While you are taking the cross, you have to do it by calling as a kind of instant and unceasing prayer to the Lord
By calling we can pray unceasingly, and by this kind of prayer we actually and spontaneously take Christ as our life
If we are such persons who practice calling on the Lord daily, we will come together full of Christ, with a living, rejoicing spirit
We will be the right persons to come to the meetings, and with such a daily life, we will become a strong support
Formerly, they stood up in the meetings to say something to express their goodness, their kindness, their humility, or their patience
When you come to the new believers to meet with them as a person full of Christ spontaneously whatever you say pray or sing expresses Christ
Others have said that to visit people by knocking on their doors will only work in Taiwan and not anywhere else
You may not be successful because you have not practiced strictly what the training has discovered in the recent past
Those who have been trained to visit people, to baptize them, and to establish home meetings can testify that the trained way works
The first baptism makes you happy, the second one will shock you, and the third one will make you crazy with enjoyment
The Bible tells us to believe and be baptized, not to believe and wait for a certain period of time until the church has a baptism
If we want to be prevailing persons in visiting people, we must be crazy with the enjoyment of Christ and happy in the Lord
We go out to knock on doors to get people baptized and set up meetings in their homes not merely to save them or release the truth to them
We need to build up the Body of Christ according to the God-ordained way to carry out the New Testament economy
The human, God-created spirit of the unbelievers is not regenerated, but as Christians, our spirit has been regenerated
When God the Spirit regenerates us, He imparts God Himself as the divine life into our being, that is, into our spirit
Because the divine life has been imparted into our human spirit, we may say that our human spirit has been made divine
The believers' spirit is a composition of three things: our human spirit, the divine life, and the Holy Spirit
Timothy 1:7 says that God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind
Love refers to affection power refers to strength and a sober mind means that we think and behave with a restricted and sober understanding
In order for our spirit, the spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit, to be fresh, strong, and active, we must exercise our spirit
All the parts of our soul and all the parts of our body need to be saturated with the Triune God so that we can be constituted into God-men
We, the believers of Christ, who love Him and who would let Him do everything to saturate us thoroughly, have become one spirit with Him
The greatest miracle in the universe is that human beings with flesh and blood can be one spirit with the Triune God
All philosophies attempt to develop our mind, our psychology, our psuche life, which is merely to develop the 'poor me'
If we are persons practicing to be one spirit with the Lord, we will be a strong, sustaining element in the meeting
One group practices wearing only clothes of a certain color, using mule wagons for transportation, and not using telephones
Galatians 5:25 says, 'If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit,' and 5:16 says, 'Walk by the Spirit'
Galatians 5:16 and 25 show us that the Christian walk must altogether be in this mingling, saturating Spirit, who is one spirit with us
To live by the Spirit walk by the Spirit pray with the spirit sing with the spirit and be strong in the spirit is to exercise the spirit
We must be persons full of the Spirit and saturated with the Spirit to practically become one spirit with the Lord in our daily experience
The constant word, however, is not so powerful, living, working, energizing, or operating within us until it becomes the instant word
When the constant word becomes the instant word, it becomes living, and it works or operates to accomplish God's purpose in us and with us
We must first learn to acquire the constant word and look to the Lord for Him to change His constant word into the instant word
If we merely read the Bible as the constant word, we will only get some objective knowledge that will not touch our inward being
In our direct contact with God, the written word is made so practical and that written word becomes the living word
When the logos becomes the rhema, we receive the benefit of the Triune God infusing Himself through His living word into our being
The chart of God's New Testament economy on pages 12 and 13 of that book contains many new titles, terms, and phrases
Corinthians 1:30 tells us that Christ 'became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
We need the wisdom from God's revelation to understand how Christ becomes our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption
We have to learn to know the word of knowledge and the word of teaching and let these words become the words of wisdom in our spirit
If we would spend more time in the presence of the Lord, this word will become the word of wisdom in our spirit to be our very life supply
We need to be fully wrapped up with the word, soaked with the word outwardly and saturated with the word inwardly
Pray-reading was a term invented by us to describe the practice of reading the word of God by prayer and with prayer
Many saints throughout church history pointed out that the best way to understand the word is to read it prayerfully
To receive God's word into the depths of our being, our spirit is needed, and the prevailing way to exercise our spirit is by praying
There are many notes in the Recovery Version on the genealogy of Jesus Christ in the first seventeen verses of Matthew 1
Only one of these five was a chaste virgin, Mary, a descendant of the chosen race of whom Christ was directly born
The other women, Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, were Gentiles, and some were extremely sinful
Such a revelation from the first chapter of Matthew comes from knowing the word as knowledge along with the exercising of prayer
In the Lord's light we can see that Jacob's brother was not chosen by God, so Christ had nothing to do with him
All the brothers of Judah were chosen by God to compose the twelve tribes of Israel, and they all were related to Christ
By naming his son Methuselah, Enoch prophesied of the coming judgment of the deluge, the great flood at the time of Noah
Rather, we have to restrict our mind and turn our mind to our spirit by praying with what we understand from the word
When we pray much by staying in the presence of the Lord, we will get a clear word from the Lord in our understanding that brings revelation
By the Lord's mercy, the word spoken in the Lord's recovery is either the word of knowledge or the word of wisdom
The table of contents of our hymnal, including the arrangement of the topics for the hymns, needed a great deal of wisdom to compose
In the Lord's recovery there is no lack of the word, but we have to spend time to get into the word by spending time to wait on the Lord
Spontaneously all the meetings in the homes will be built up, and a strong church life will be seen in all the home meetings
As long as we can make a sufficient living to support our family and take care of our children's education, we should be satisfied
If we are really filled and saturated with the Spirit and the word, we will be persons praying unceasingly and singing all the time
Only the four factors of the mingled spirit, the word, praying, and singing can constitute us into such a person
Many of the saints who have gone out to visit people by knocking on their doors can testify concerning the power of prayer
We may pray at the beginning and at the end of the meeting, but we should not make this something legal or formal
Exercising the spirit means not waiting for the Spirit's inspiration but taking the initiative by pushing our spirit to pray
When Brother Nee responded to this question, he jokingly said, 'This person might be saved, but not regenerated'
Others may shout, call on the name of the Lord, and sing in the meetings, but these ones never exercise their spirit
To prevent our meetings from being dead, we must learn to pick up the four basic factors for our Christian meetings
We should be mingled with the Spirit, soaked and saturated with the living word, and we should be praying and singing
We will be equipped, qualified, and completed to be the proper visitors to knock on people's doors and set up home meetings
As people who love the Lord, we must live according to God's ordained way to practice His New Testament economy
After we go out to visit others and baptize them, we must endeavor to take care of them through the home meetings
If the churches are faithful to the Lord's new way, many new churches can be raised up within a short amount of time
We will be happy in the Lord, crazy with the enjoyment of Christ, and the doors of the homes that we visit will open to us
He told the seventy that He was sending them as lambs in the midst of wolves , but in the midst of these wolves were sons of peace
Today the Lord has shown us that all the members of the church should be visitors going out to bring the gospel to people
In the Lord's new way, we must do these two things: go to visit people and go to establish and care for home meetings
We have published a four-volume series entitled Life Lessons for the nourishment of the new believers in their homes
God came to find fallen man, then God preached the gospel to fallen man, and finally God ministered salvation to the condemned man
He came to 'knock on Adam's door' immediately after Adam sinned by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The seed of the woman was Jesus Christ who was born of a virgin, and He bruised the head of the old serpent, the devil, on the cross
God came in to clothe them in a proper way, signifying that God's salvation clothes fallen man with Christ Himself
God came down to visit Israel in order to deliver them out of the usurping hand and the tyranny of Pharaoh in Egypt
The Lord's word shows us that the unit of God's salvation is not an individual person, but the whole family, the whole house
The Lord had to pass through Samaria because He had to go to Jacob's well to wait for that sinful, Samaritan woman
He sent the twelve to go to the cities and villages to visit the lost sheep of the house of Israel and bring them peace
While the Lord Jesus was physically on this earth, He did not practice calling meetings, but He always went to visit
The Lord also sent the seventy to go to every city and place to seek the sons of peace , and we have to do likewise
A husband may have had an argument with his wife, and when you go to visit him, he may be a son of rebellion that evening
If we have the patience and endurance to knock on the same door again and again, the ones who live there may eventually become sons of peace
If we are speaking the gospel all the time, we will eventually be prevailing, and our preaching will be full of power
It is regrettable that the proper people, the Christians, have nearly given up the God-ordained way to spread the gospel
Our past practice may have been good, but it is not nearly as effective as our present practice of going out to visit people
We have been sent to visit people by the ascended Christ, and while we are talking to people, we are linked to Christ
Because we have been entrusted with the authority of the ascended Christ to preach the gospel, we should not ask people questions
The most effective way to preach the gospel is not to ask questions but to direct people to repent, pray, and be baptized
Baptism changes people because we are baptizing them into the name of the Triune God, which is the sum total of the divine Being
To go out to visit people for the spread of the gospel by knocking on their doors is altogether reasonable and logical
The gospel should be spread and preached, and the best way to bring the gospel to others is to go to them by knocking on their doors
The universal true vine and its branches as revealed in John 15 should be considered as a reality more than as a metaphor
The organism of the Divine Trinity in John 15 is the Divine Trinity mingled with His chosen, redeemed, and regenerated people
Our destiny as branches of the universal true vine is to bear fruit for the glorification, the expression, of the Father
Many Christians consider that bearing fruit depends upon the environment and that not bearing fruit is therefore excusable
The leading ones should not say, 'You must wait before going out to knock on doors until we get everything prepared for the whole church'
To ask someone to wait until something is prepared before bearing fruit is like asking someone to stop breathing
In the past when the saints brought a person to the Lord, our practice was to get the church's approval before he could be baptized
Around 1930, in Shanghai there was a young man who received the Lord and was planning to study in the United States
Brother Nee was very burdened that this young man be baptized immediately before he left China, but one of the leading ones would not agree
God's destiny for us is to bear fruit, so we must go out to knock on doors, visit people, help them to believe, and baptize them
In the last ten years the rate of increase, especially in Orange County, has only been about three percent each year
We cannot change the Bible the Lord Jesus God the truth the gospel salvation or any of the divine things yet we can surely change our way!
For a branch to bear fruit is crucial; otherwise, it will lose all of the enjoyment, riches, nourishment, and life supply of the vine
The way to bear fruit is by abiding in the vine , by being supplied with the Lord's instant words , and by going forth
Some Bible teachers have said that the fruit in John 15 is the fruit of our character, such as good ethics, good morality, and good virtues
To bear fruit is the way to fulfill God's destiny, and the way to bear fruit is to visit people by knocking on their doors
We must practice the New Testament economy in the trained way and not in a way according to our natural disposition
Christians and unbelievers can come together to worship God according to their natural thought in a natural and religious way
Without the priest or pastor and a choir, some might consider that this is not the proper place to come to worship God
Without these traditional, religious, and formal things, many would not consider their meeting to be the proper worship of God
In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman, 'God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit
They do not help people to do anything in the Spirit, so it is very difficult for them to have a proper Christian gathering
When we set up Christian meetings there, the new ones realize that they should not do it according to their background of Buddhism
In order to take the new way, we have to drop all the old ways we have picked up and all the things we are accustomed to doing
We have published a book entitled How to Meet, but the more one reads that book the more he may not know how to meet
The way to meet is to drop all the natural, religious ways of Christianity by turning to our spirit and living a normal life in the spirit
The way to set up home meetings is first to forsake Christianity's traditional, natural, and religious way of meeting
In Acts also there were many activities and spontaneous meetings, but there is no record to tell us exactly how they met
We must set up the home meetings in such a way that every attendant, even a young child, has an equal opportunity to function
We must learn how to promote and develop, that is, to cultivate, the organic gifts of each member of the Body of Christ
As regenerated Christians we must let the divine life develop within us, and this development produces the gift of life, the organic gift
In the proper Christian meetings we should afford everyone a sufficient time and opportunity to exercise his gifts
From the time we first set up a meeting, we must always make it clear that everyone has to function and learn to exercise his spirit
It is remarkable that little children learn language not by being taught but by living among and listening to other speakers
In setting up the home meetings we have no intention to organize something to build up a facade to attract people
Eventually, we should impress the new believers not with anything of the deformed and degraded Christianity but with the God-ordained way
Simply go there to help them to have a home meeting, and impress them with the God-ordained way to practice the New Testament economy
In the home meetings we have to tell the attendants that Christian meetings are for the worship of God and the Lord Jesus
To worship God and the Lord Jesus does not necessarily mean that we have to kneel down or bow down to adore Him with praises and thanks
In our understanding, in our realization, and in our spirit we should do all things with the sense of worshipping God and the Lord Jesus
The New Testament does not indicate to us that to worship God and the Lord Jesus is just a matter of kneeling down or bowing down
The sinner was satisfied with the Savior's living water, and the Savior was satisfied with God's will in satisfying the sinner
Although this is a mere religious form, they consider that what they are doing is the best worship rendered to God
The Bible does not tell us definitely that when we worship God and the Lord Jesus, we should bow down or kneel down
To think that worshipping God and the Lord Jesus is merely a matter of bowing down or kneeling down is according to the religious concept
Rather, when we talk one with another in our spirit, the Spirit of God, who is God Himself, participates in our talking
Suppose that a loving mother prepared a good dinner for her son who came back home from school after half a year
If this son knelt down and bowed down to the mother and even fell asleep in this posture, do you think the mother would be pleased?
The mother will feel happy and pleasant if her son eats the food she has prepared and if he talks to her while he eats
Genesis 18 gives us a record of the Lord Jesus coming to Abraham in the form of a man even before His incarnation
Abraham even walked with Jehovah to send Him off, and during this walk, Jehovah talked to Abraham and Abraham prayed
God, as Abraham's friend, opened up His heart to Abraham to tell him of the coming destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
In Genesis 18 there is a record of Abraham's worship, Abraham's prayer, but his worship to God, his prayer, was not in a religious way
Abraham's worship, his prayer, was his conversing with God in an intimate, human way as a friend, and this is the best prayer
The best way to worship, to pray, is to talk to God, to converse with the Lord Jesus in a human way as a part of our daily walk
He received worship in a human way from His human friend, and He talked to His human friend in a very intimate and personal way
In one of the beginning meetings with the new ones, we need to let them know that the real worship to God is to talk to Him as our friend
They need to realize that we are sons of God who have the divine life and the divine nature, so we are the same as He is
We need to take some time to explain to the new ones and to teach them to know God by talking to Him in an intimate way
God is not happy with our worshipping Him with the concept that we are small, fearing God to the uttermost and bowing down to the great God
When we go to the home meetings, we need to forget about the natural, religious way to meet as in Christianity
The proper worship of the Lord Jesus can also be seen in the house of Simon the leper in Bethany where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus were
While the Lord Jesus was walking on this earth, a formal, religious, Judaic worship was going on in the temple
At that time did God prefer the Judaic worship in the temple or the worship that can be seen in the house of Simon the leper?
If Christ is not the content of our daily life, what we do in the meetings is a performance in which we are the actors
Many Christians today prefer to have big meetings according to schedules with a proper pastor and choir clothed in long gowns
The more we enjoy Him, the more we talk to Him, contact Him, in a friendly and intimate way, the more He will be happy
Concerning the bread of the Lords table the Lord said that this was His body and He told the disciples to take and eat in remembrance of Him
We need to lead and promote each one of the attendants in the home meetings to learn to take part in the activities in the meetings
By doing this, you will be practicing to promote each one of them to learn to take part in the activities in the meetings
Finally, we need to take the chance to pray and to call a hymn at the right juncture as one among the attendants
In the Lord's recovery our preaching, teaching, and home meetings must come up to the high standard revealed in the New Testament
The gospel of the kingdom includes not only forgiveness of sins and the impartation of life , but also the kingdom of the heavens
To enter into the kingdom of God, that is, to enter into the divine kingdom, we must be regenerated with the divine life
The fruit of an apple tree will be in the shape of an apple, and the fruit of a peach tree will be in the shape of a peach
We are men possessing the human life, but God's intention is to transfer us into His divine life, making us divine
The kingdom of God is the Lord Himself as the seed of life sown into His believers to develop into God's ruling realm
The divine reign in the divine life is revealed in Luke 172021 where the Lord Jesus told us that this divine reign cannot be seen outwardly
All the riches of Christ's being and of Christ's doing compose the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ
He is our real air , our real food , our real drink , our real clothing , and our real lodging, our dwelling place
The entire universe is a mystery, but within this mystery there is a deeper mystery which has been hidden in God
Paul told us that he preached not only the unsearchable riches of Christ but also the economy of this mystery hidden in God from the ages
Economy is an anglicization of the Greek word oikonomia, denoting an arrangement, an administration, a plan, a purpose
Few enjoy the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ and the gospel of the economy of the mystery hidden in God from the ages
To enjoy the gospel concerning the economy of the mystery hidden in God is to enjoy the church life, the life of the Body of Christ
We must realize that we are in the enjoyment of the highest gospel, the gospel of the arrangement of the divine mystery- Christ and His Body
The people in the world do not know the meaning of human existence, but we know because we enjoy the church life around the globe
Even the unbelievers were able to sing that hymn, and some young boys on the street would mockingly sing it to the Christians
Our hymnal entitled Hymns was compiled in 1964 with one thousand and eighty selected hymns two hundred sixtyeight more have since been added
In addition to the high standard of hymns for the home meetings, we must also have the high standard of prayer, both in word and in spirit
Fifty years ago in north China we conducted healing and casting out of demons, but we did not do it in a low way
The healing was not simply to recover the sick ones' health, but to impart life into them according to 1 John 5:16
When you go out to knock on doors and you find sickness, pray for the healing of the sick ones at their request
When you see demon possession, do not hesitate, but immediately exercise your right to cast out the demons in the name of the Lord Jesus
In the foregoing chapters, we have seen a clear vision of God's ordained way to practice the New Testament economy
To oppose or criticize the new way of knocking on doors and setting up home meetings in the new believers' homes is foolish
What is wrong for believers to go out to visit people by knocking on their doors, baptizing them into the processed Triune God?
Whether or not this way corresponds with your own idea concerning preaching the gospel, you cannot say that it is wrong
No church or leading one should prohibit others from taking this way or tell others to wait until the church is ready to practice this way
All the leaders of the churches around the globe should say 'Amen' to this way, whether or not they agree with it
Even if only one fourth of these remain there would be close to nine hundred believers who could form ten new churches in ten new localities
Rather, we should take the lead to rise up to go out to visit people in order to set up home meetings, and all the saints will follow
If we do well, the increase could be threefold each year, or at the very least, one hundred percent increase each year
Our practice in the past years was to have many big meetings each week in which message after message was given
If the meetings are scattered, the saints will not die; rather, the saints will go to the homes with Jesus, the Bible, and salvation
You are not only a member of the Body of Christ universally, but you are also a member of the church in your locality
Do not do anything independently, but do everything in dependence on your local church with thorough fellowship
Regardless of how much we say that we are right, as long as we are independent of the church in our locality, we are divisive
Independence from the Body is like cancer, a disease not of germs, but of cells which grow for their own purpose
With such an attitude, it will be dangerous for us to take the new way, risking a division that could seriously damage the Body
We all have to learn, on the one hand, not to control others, and on the other hand, to depend upon our brothers
For one to consider that, since he brought the Lord's recovery to a certain place, he has the right to control the church there, is foolish
We should take such a living as the purpose of life, whether we are job-dropping full-timers or money-making full-timers
Every day, every week, every month, and every year throughout our whole life, we must go out to baptize people and set up home meetings
No occupation, regardless of the competition, is to such a high standard that it does not leave us any leisure time
All of our time, our money, and our energy must be spent for the unique purpose of knocking on people's doors and setting up home meetings
Every day we should live before the judgment seat of Christ, being fearful that if the Lord comes, we may not be ready to meet Him
Every point of the final four chapters of this book is crucial and vital to our present situation in the Lord's recovery
We must be deeply impressed that what is revealed in the four Gospels plus Acts is the one way to carry out God's one goal
There are not two ways to practice the New Testament economy revealed in the first five books of the New Testament
The one completed Christ was preached and propagated for the spreading of the kingdom of God by one way according to God's eternal economy
The saints in the early church life in the book of Acts were endeavoring to reach the one unique goal to complete God's eternal economy
The New Jerusalem is the total conclusion of the sixty-six books of the divine revelation and is the eternal goal in God's eternal economy
Paul's co-worker, Barnabas, was in this one way for a while, and he was the one who brought Paul into this one way
After this incident Barnabas no longer appears in the divine record in Acts of the Lord's move in God's New Testament economy
After the record of Barnabas's contention with Paul in Acts 15, we read the names only of Paul and his co-workers
The first Epistle in the New Testament is the book of Romans, which is concerning the Christian life for the church life
Some of the saints preferred Paul's ministry, others preferred Apollos's ministry, and still others preferred Cephas's ministry
In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus with the one purpose of charging certain ones not to teach differently
The truth of baptism is a part of God's economy, but if this truth is stressed apart from God's economy, it will cause division
Even among those who believe in baptism by immersion there are different concepts concerning the method of baptism
There was also a division between Darby and George Muller, who became famous for his work with orphans and his living by faith
One evening in Glendale, California, in the home of a Pentecostal brother, we were all meeting together, and the saints were happy
Suddenly one of the brothers from the Pentecostal group proposed that all of the four different groups come together
Romans 14 tells us how we need to receive the believers according to God's receiving and not according to doctrinal concepts
Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him'
Paul wrote this to the saints in Rome so that they would not be divided over doctrinal concepts and preferences
He responded that there was no difference in the eyes of God, but he still insisted that he did not like tambourines in the meeting
Many of the saints could not stay in oneness because they could not give up their preference, their choice, their taste
Some brothers tried to take the way of the Lord's recovery, but they eventually began to express their opinions
Because of the new way, however, there is an open door for us to think that we are free to do whatever we desire
Those who meet in the halls in Taipei are less than four thousand, but outside the halls there are over eight thousand meeting in homes
Recently one young sister among us went out to visit people for close to a week without getting anyone baptized
The God-ordained way to practice the New Testament economy is the unique way, the biblical way, and the most effective way
The Lord Jesus did tell us, however, that no one who has drunk the old wine desires the new, for he says that the old is better
When we get into the taste of knocking on doors to turn people to believe and be baptized, we will become addicted to this gospel service
They have to learn the truth and learn how to present the truth in a proper way in the Lord's unique New Testament ministry
Timothy 1 speaks of the teaching concerning God's economy and chapter six speaks of the healthy words of the Lord Jesus
All the teachings of the apostles are for God's economy, and these teachings are the healthy words of the Lord Jesus
In Ephesians 3:8 Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel and in verse 9 he speaks of God's eternal economy
The teaching and the fellowship are related to the apostles, while the breaking of bread and the prayers are not related to the apostles
All the problems, divisions, and confusion among the Christians today are due to one thing-not caring for the apostles' teaching
Many things are taught in Christendom that do not belong to or are not in the sphere of the apostles' teaching
Although baptism by immersion is scripturally correct, to make it a term by which one receives the believers is altogether sectarian
When the Lord showed us the truth of the one Body of Christ and of divisions being of the flesh, we began to condemn the word denomination
The presbytery, which is an anglicized Greek word referring to the body of elders or the eldership in a local church , is a biblical truth
Even to use a certain practice which is scriptural to denominate a certain group is to make a division, to form a named, official sect
We should not make anything, even if that thing is scriptural, a term or a condition of fellowship with other saints
God's economy is not to have a mission field for preaching the gospel or to have a Bible school to teach the truths
We believe in His ascension, and we believe that today He is the life-giving Spirit, indwelling us to live in us that we may live Him
If we teach wrongly and differently from the apostles' teaching, our teaching will produce a sectarian, divisive fellowship
Many Baptist denominations will fellowship only with ones who have been baptized by a Baptist preacher in 'Baptist water'
We can have one way for one goal by keeping ourselves strictly in the limit of the apostles' teaching and the apostles' fellowship
Anyone who would go out to another place to raise up the church life must have adequate fellowship with the church he has been meeting with
The church in a locality should not be raised up by us independently without any fellowship with the source we came from
If we do this independently without any relationship to any church, what we raise up will be an independent sect
To preach the gospel, to baptize people, and to set up home meetings is not related to the apostles' fellowship
They should not have the attitude that the saints need to get their permission to raise up the church life in a certain place
As we go out to knock on people's doors, baptize people, and set up home meetings, we must practice this fellowship
Once we practice independence, we get ourselves into the dangerous state of being detached or separated from the Body
Today in the church, we must realize that if we are going to keep the proper fellowship, we must learn to live by the divine life
If this brother responds to the leading ones in this way, he is speaking by his natural life and not by the divine life
All that we say and do must be the right thing in the right spirit with the right life, which is the divine life, not our human life
To keep the one way for the one goal and to stay in the fellowship of the apostles, we must live and behave in the divine life
If you take the church ground by your natural life for your own standing, the ground on which you stand is the ground of division
The ground of the church must be the ground of oneness, and this oneness can only be kept by our being in the spirit with the divine life
Far, we have seen that in God's economy there is one goal and that God has ordained one way to reach this goal
One way for one goal cannot be seen in today's Christianity because they are not in the sphere of the apostles' teaching and fellowship
All these different teachings bring people into different fellowships, and the different fellowships are divisions in confusion
If we remain, live, and have our being in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, we can have one way for one goal
The ministry of the New Testament economy is singular and unique, but the ministers of the New Testament economy are plural
Man should not control, but the vision of God's New Testament economy should exercise control over each one of us
God revealed His economy to His chosen ones such as Peter, John, James, Paul, and others who were working with Paul
In 2 Corinthians Paul calls the ministry of the Old Testament the ministry of letter and the ministry of condemnation
The teachers of the law and the prophets carried out the one ministry of the law in the Old Testament, not many ministries
When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He chose twelve apostles and gave them a commission, which was the ministry
In 2 Corinthians 4:1 Paul said, 'Therefore, having this ministry, as we have received mercy we do not lose heart'
There are many ministries in today's degraded Christianity, but there are not many ministries in the New Testament
If each of us had different ministries, this would mean that we were building something of ourselves for ourselves
The inner life movement began in the seventeenth century with the mystics in the Catholic Church such as Madame Guyon and Father Fenelon
Jesse Penn-Lewis received help from Andrew Murray and went on to see much concerning the subjective death of Christ
From the subjective death of Christ she went on to talk about spiritual warfare in a book entitled War on the Saints
Penn-Lewis went to an extreme on the matter of spiritual warfare, and at the end of her life, she became preoccupied with demons
At a certain point, he realized that he could not work with her anymore because as a sister she exercised too much headship
For two different ministries to be carried out by two ministers is altogether against the principle of the New Testament
The ministries of Sister Penn-Lewis and Brother Sparks became two kinds of works to produce two groups of people
The New Testament ministry was commissioned by the Lord Jesus to His twelve apostles and then to Paul and his co-workers
The deciding factor in determining the right ministry, which is the ministry of God's New Testament economy, is the teaching of the apostles
To preach anything other than the apostles' teaching is to preach something that is not a part of the ministry of the New Testament economy
In Christianity there are a few big speakers, but in the Lord's recovery we need to have thousands of speakers
The ministry is not merely the ministry of a few gifted ones, but it is the ministry of each one of the saints
Although there is the truth of the leadership in the New Testament ministry, the Lord did not officially appoint someone to be the leader
The leadership was something spontaneous according to life, according to the real need, and according to the situation
John 1011 says If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching do not receive him into your house and do not say to him Rejoice!
In the New Testament we cannot see an organization with board members, a chairman, a secretary, or other officers
Sometimes in the New Testament Paul told some of his co-workers to go to certain places or to remain in other places
The leadership which is shown in the New Testament is mainly in the teachings of the ministers, not in the acts of co-workers
As the Lord's recovery is spreading throughout the entire world, who can direct the acts of so many co-workers and serving ones?
They must pray and seek the Lord's leading and fellowship with the dear saints who are so concerned for the Lord's move on this earth today
Through fellowship and prayer with the saints, they will be clear whether they should stay where they are or go to another place
In the recovery in God's ministry, there is no freedom to preach whatever we like to preach or to teach whatever we like to teach
Our preaching and our teaching have to be restricted under the leadership by the revelation of God's New Testament economy
There would never be confusion in the Lord's recovery if all of us had a clear revelation of the ministry in God's New Testament economy
In the early years of the Lord's recovery on mainland China we suffered a great loss when we tried to practice speaking in tongues
Eventually the co-workers there spontaneously concluded that tongue-speaking was not a profit to the Lord's move on this earth
The writer encouraged them all to go on speaking in tongues regardless of their doubts about the genuineness of what they were uttering
The greatest damage of Pentecostalism is that it makes it difficult for believers to appreciate the inward organic union with the Triune God
The saints who have a vision of God's New Testament economy would not care for teachings that stress and emphasize other things
We have the leadership of one controlling revelation in the one ministry through those who bring in the revelation of the ministry
The Lord's move on this earth is through His unique ministry, and we are all participating in this unique ministry
We must cooperate with the Lord to pick up the new way, the God-ordained way, to practice the New Testament economy
