<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LEARNING, EXERCISING, AND PRACTICING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 2:4; Heb. 5:12-14; 2 Pet. 3:18; 1 Pet. 2:2-3; Eph. 4:13-16</H1><P>According to God's creation, our mouth has many purposes. Our mouth is used for breathing, drinking, and eating, yet the ultimate use of our mouth is for speaking.</P><P>Our speaking can be of three categories. The first category is prophesying. The second kind of speaking is that which is proper and upright. The third kind of speaking is in the category of evil speaking. This includes gossiping, criticizing, reasoning, quarreling, and expressions of anger. To prophesy is something from the heavens, to speak in a proper way is something on the earth, and to gossip is something from Gehenna (Matt. 5:22). In today's society, most of the speaking is not from the earth but from Gehenna.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. LEARNING</H2><P>Among us, there must be the first category of speaking, the category of speaking from the heavens. Prophesying is this kind of speaking. To speak for God, to speak God forth, and to speak Christ into people, ministering the riches of Christ into another person's being, is the highest speaking. But in order to prophesy, we must learn. Every kind of speaking comes out of learning. Proper speaking requires proper learning.</P><P>Because prophesying is the highest speaking, we also need the highest learning. We cannot carry out the highest speaking without learning the highest language. On the one hand, in the training meetings I urge, charge, and encourage all the saints to prophesy. But on the other hand, I sympathize with the saints because I know that to prophesy is really not easy. Prophesying is the highest speaking. To gossip or to lose one's temper is easy. There is no need of preparation to gossip or lose one's temper. But prophesying requires preparation.</P><P>In society to be a very good speaker requires much learning. When a person speaks, his educational level can be discerned. If a person were thirty years of age and had only finished junior high school, his ability would be limited. There is a difference between ability and capacity. Capacity is something by birth; but ability is something by birth plus learning, training, and practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Truths</H2><P>In this message, I want to point out twenty-two major points of the truths which we need to learn.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Concerning the Person of God</H2><P>The first item we all must learn is the truth concerning the person of God. This is the most puzzling truth in the Bible.</P>
