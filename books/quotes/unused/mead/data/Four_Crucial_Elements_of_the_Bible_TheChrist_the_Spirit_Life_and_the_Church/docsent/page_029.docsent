   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Another Comforter Being the Holy Spirit Whom the Father Sent in the Son's Name</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 14 contains many revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 6 says that Christ is the way, the reality, and the life; verse 9 says that he who has seen the Son has seen the Father; verse 11 says that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son; and verses 16 and 17 say that another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, would be given to the disciples not only to abide with them but also to be in them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the four most important verses in John 14 are verses 10, 20, 23, and 26.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, the revelation in these four verses is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, to study the experience in verse 20, we need to go on to study verse 23.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 23 the Lord said, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is truly wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why is it that when one loves the Lord, the Father loves him?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why did the Lord say that the Father would love him, instead of saying that He Himself would love him?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Would not the Lord also love him?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then the Lord continued, "And We will come to him and make an abode with him."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We here refers to the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to our thinking, if a person loves the Son, the Son will love him and will enter into him with rejoicing to abide in him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But why did the Lord say that when one loves the Son, it is the Father who would love him, and the Father and the Son would come to him and make an abode with him?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to explain this verse, we must go on to study verse 26.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we have seen, verse 20 says that the Son abides in the disciples, and it is through the Holy Spirit, whom the Father sent, that the Son is able to abide in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then, verse 26 says, "But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and remind you of all the things which I have said to you."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This verse says that the Holy Spirit is sent by the Father in the Son's name.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to grammar, in My name is a modifier; to be in His name is to be in His person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, when we read this verse, it is very difficult to say whether in My name refers to the Father sending in the Son or to the Spirit being sent in the Son, that is, whether this phrase modifies the Father or the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, in My name modifies the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the Father sending the Holy Spirit in the Son's name is equivalent to the Son sending the Holy Spirit; that is, the Father's sending of the Holy Spirit in the Son's name is the Son's sending of the Holy Spirit from the Father 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, the Son sent the Spirit from the Father and with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This does not mean that the Son sent with the Father but that the Spirit comes with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit Being One, and the Son Being the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 14:26 says that the Father sent the Spirit in the Son, and the Father and the Son are one because the Father is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then, 15:26 shows us that the Son sent the Spirit from the Father and with the Father; hence, the Spirit is with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The former indicates that the Father and the Son are one and that the Father is in the Son, while the latter says that the Spirit came from the Father and with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The former tells us that the Father is in the Son, especially in the sending of the Spirit, while the latter tells us that it was the Son who sent the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Does this mean that there were two Senders?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Father and the Son are two, but in the sending of the Spirit They are one, because it is the Father sending in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the Father's sending is the Son's sending.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we study these two verses together, we can conclude that the Spirit who is sent comes with the Father, and the Father sends the Spirit in the Son's name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the Spirit comes with the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This proves that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one and cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, to experience Christ, we need to see that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If He were not the Spirit, we could not experience Him, and He could not come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ephesians 3:17 says, "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The chorus of Hymns, #309 says, "Since Jesus came into my heart!"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If Christ is not the Spirit, how can He come into my heart and make His home in my heart?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not merely repeat what others say.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps we do not understand this mystery, but we must know this fact and experience this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since Christ as the Spirit lives in our heart today, we can sing, "Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Throughout the generations, Christians who love the Lord all have experienced the joy of the Lord's making His home in their hearts by their having intimate fellowship with the Lord and touching His Spirit in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although many of them can neither understand nor speak this truth, they have experienced the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every word of the Lord is established.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, we may not understand why, but if we just "amen" His word, we will have the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can use calling on the Lord's name as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Romans 10:13 says, "For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are now able to explain this truth because we have studied the Bible for a few decades, examined and compared others' writings, and experienced it ourselves Acts 2:21, footnote 1 in the Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, today, if we release our spirit to call on the name of the Lord, immediately we experience being saved from all kinds of people, events, and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Likewise, we can experience Christ's making His home in our hearts through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How can Christ make His home in our hearts?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is because He is the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some say that Christ abides in our hearts not directly but through the Holy Spirit or in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, regardless of whether we say "through" or "in," Christ and the Spirit are actually one in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Putting John 14:26 and 20 together, we see that in that day, the day of the Lord's resurrection, the Father sent another Comforter that the disciples may know that the Son is in the Father and also in them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 17 says that another Comforter would come to abide with the disciples and be in them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Are there two persons in us, one who is the Son and the other who is the Spirit as another Comforter?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These two are one in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, the Son who is in us, mentioned in verse 20, is the Spirit who is in us, mentioned in verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then as to the Father, the first half of verse 20 says, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This "I," who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17, is in "My Father."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, when the Spirit comes, the Son comes, and when the Son comes, He comes in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This corresponds with the revelation in 14:26 and 15:26.</S>
