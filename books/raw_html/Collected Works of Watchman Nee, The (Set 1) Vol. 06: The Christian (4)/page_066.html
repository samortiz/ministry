<P>There are many other passages in the Bible which speak of the principle of "give, and it will be given to you." One verse that many Christians treasure very much is Philippians 4:19. This verse teaches the same thing. Paul said, "And my God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus." This verse is truly a great promise. But we must never forget the condition laid out in this verse. From verses 15 to 18 Paul spoke of how the Philippians supplied his needs. Then in verse 19, he said that God would fill all their needs. Please notice that it was not your God who would supply all their needs, but my God who would supply all their needs. It was the God of Paul, the God of the one who received the supply, who would supply all their needs. Furthermore, it was to supply every need of "yours," the supplying ones. First you give and then God gives to you.</P><P>Elijah's offering on Mount Carmel is another good example (see 1 Kings 18). An elderly sister in the Lord once said, "If Elijah had not offered up the water, the water from heaven would not have come." At that time, a drought had been going on for three and a half years. There was no water in the whole nation. Even the king had to personally seek out grass for his mules. One can see the seriousness of the drought at that time. How precious was water! They needed water. But when Elijah offered the sacrifice, he poured out water again and again, twelve barrels full, onto the sacrifice. The Bible says that "the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water" (v. 35). Soon after, "the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain" (v. 45). If no water had been offered up, no water would have come down! About five years ago, I remember that I had such an experience for the first time. I had to go to a certain place to conduct meetings. The traveling expense was about twenty dollars. I only had twelve dollars with me. I prayed for the traveling expenses and the meetings for about a week. Originally I intended to leave on a Sunday evening. On Friday I mentioned to God the matter of the traveling expenses again. There were only two days until the date of my departure. It seemed that I was urging God, but He told me that a co-worker of mine was in need and that I should give him three dollars. This was quite difficult for me to do. How could I give to others when I did not have enough for myself ? But God's commandment never gives room for negotiation. In the end, I put three dollars into an envelope and sent it to my co-worker. Although three dollars was not much, when I did it, there were tears in my eyes. I thought that the Lord would surely take care of my traveling needs then. But to my surprise, on Sunday night no specially designated money came. However, I knew that I was walking in God's will and I left home in peace. The first part of my journey was a ride on a steamer for a night and a day. After that I needed to hire a boat and travel for another week. The cost of the steamer journey was a dollar, and I was able to pay for it. But the boat could not be hired for less than twenty dollars. I prayed that the Lord would provide me the necessary funds while traveling on the steamer. When the steamer approached the pier, I still did not have the money. At that time, the Holy Spirit taught me how to pray. Instead of praying for money, I prayed for a boat with a cheaper fare. I prayed this way, and when I reached the pier, I found a small boat that was able to take me to my destination for seventy cents. I was left with more than I needed. After the meetings, I wondered about my return fare. The Lord heard my prayer. When I came back home, I still had some dollars left over. As soon as I reached home, I went to see my co-worker. He was not at home, and I only managed to see his wife. She asked me why I had given her husband three dollars. I told her that I was merely following the Lord's leading and that it was not something I had initiated. Then she told me that when the money came to them, they had used up their last penny. The Lord used the three dollars to sustain them for a week before directing other channels to glorify His name. If I had failed the Lord that day, would the Lord also have failed His servant on that day? Actually, I did not have to use the three dollars anyway. When I returned home, I could not help but to praise the Lord in tears.</P><P>God is most wise. He knows what things will harm us. The matter of giving is not a business transaction where one can only work with capital. If we do not give, our God is seemingly frustrated from His work. God loves to see us trusting in Him single-heartedly. He does not want to see us holding anything back, trusting in our savings rather than in Him. God also loves to see us loving His children and His creation. He does not like to see us saving our wealth for ourselves. God wants to work with us to supply others. He can send manna from heaven directly, but it pleases Him to share a part of His glory with His children and work with them. Therefore, He wants us to give to others.</P><P>There is also a question of measure. "For with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you in return" (Luke 6:38). The degree to which we obey this verse of promise will be the degree to which we receive blessings from the Lord. Blessed are those who are willing to give in full measure to others. They will see a God of full measure working for them in full measure. "He who sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap" (2 Cor. 9:6). Many consider this word to be about the future; if one sows in this age, then he will reap in the next. While this is quite true, it is also true that if one sows in this age, he will also reap in this age. All of our offerings are not being wastefully thrown away; they are sowings that will have real reapings. If one sows, the harvest will come when the old supply is used up. If we give our money away, God will send what we need in our time of need. The harvest is always more abundant than the sowing. What is given to us will always be more than what we gave. Just as farming in this world promises a definite reaping, our giving promises no less sure results.</P><P>Only those who are rich in this world give to others out of their excess. But the Lord desires to see us giving like the rich ones without having the reserve of the rich. We rejoice when we can give more than the rich give. The more we give, the more the Lord will give to us. The more the Lord gives to us, the more we will be able to give. Wealth can never be lost; it merely circulates. It is a pity that the houses of many rich believers are full, but their hands are not because they have not given anything for the Lord. All of our dormant and idle money will condemn us at the judgment seat. But now we are not speaking to the rich; we are speaking to the poor brothers. We should give. We should ask the Lord to make us more generous in giving than the average rich person.</P><P>Giving is a condition. We have to give to the Lord before He will give to us. I believe all of us know the name Colgate. He is the most famous manufacturer in the world of soap, toothpaste, and perfume. When he was leaving England for America as a young man, he went to see his pastor and asked for a word before his departure. The pastor put his hand on Mr. Colgate's head and said, "Take God as your Head in everything, and He will bless you." When he arrived in America, he only had a little more than ten dollars. With that money he made some soap and sold it. Although he was poor, he offered a dollar to God for every ten dollars he made. When God increased his production, he offered two dollars for every ten dollars he made. In the end he offered five dollars for every ten dollars he made. Today his toothpaste is the most famous toothpaste in the world. He gave, and God gave back to him. Please prove the reality of God's promise in this verse.</P>
