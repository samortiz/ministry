   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING, LIVING, AND TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Dear brothers and sisters, you are all elders and co-workers in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You should be talking about this day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since you are the elders and the co-workers, you should take the lead to do this and should teach the saints to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Permit me to say that according to my observation, I have not seen much of this kind of condition among you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have to say an honest word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our condition is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are those who take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have a heavy responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all have to bow down before the Lord and admit that for many years, we have neglected the works that we ought to do as elders and co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to ask the Lord to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I say this not to give you a hard time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am being painfully repetitious with the good intention that we would see the real situation among us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For many years we have had no progress.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have been deeply sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How poor we have been.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason, I would not allow the situation to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have to wake everyone up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have been wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our direction has been absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you travel around today, what is seen and heard in many places is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are all things that are not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is meaningless to find out who is right and who is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be wrong is worth nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be right is also worth nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these are things that come from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we need is the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us talk about the death of Christ instead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we go back to the churches, we should help all of the saints to know the death of Christ in these seven statuses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At least we have to spend half a year to teach them, until everyone, old and young, great and small, can speak about them, and can understand the meaning of them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only then will the situation be up to standard.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should speak about this, live this, and express this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the situation that we should have in every local church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>KNOWING THE MYSTERIOUS RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Following this, we have to talk about the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The resurrection of Christ seems simple, but it too is actually mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, the God-man, Christ, resurrected from the dead and brought the humanity that He had put on into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This divinity is His status as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When He resurrected, He brought His human part into divinity and was born the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second, in this way, He was no longer the only begotten Son but also the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the only begotten, there was only divinity, the status of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the firstborn Son there is the divine element plus the human element.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the same way with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We were the sons of man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But as soon as we believe and receive the Lord, we become the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's nature and elements are added into our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Third, in His resurrection, we were all resurrected together with Him to be born the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ's becoming flesh brings divinity into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His resurrection brings humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way, God and man are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Moreover, in His resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit, entering into all those who believe in Him to be their life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These are the four great things that Christ accomplished in His resurrection: bringing humanity into divinity, being born the firstborn Son of God with His humanity, begetting us as the sons of God through resurrection with Him, and becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way, He brought all those who believe in Him into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are fully mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the mysterious resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>RAISING UP THE ATMOSPHERE OF</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>PURSUIT FOR THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Brothers, I believe these truths are in the books that we have published.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should pursue after these things, speak about these things, and should teach the brothers and sisters these things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should be an "educated" family, one that is filled with the atmosphere of pursuit for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not talk about or discuss anything but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should be those who become alive in Christ this way, and we should exercise moment by moment to live in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In our speaking and in our conduct, we should follow our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you elders and co-workers do this, I fully believe that after a year or so all the churches will be speaking Christ, discussing Christ, and living Christ, and there will be no difficulty or storm among us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
