   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God regenerates us with His divine life that we may begin to participate in His divinity to have His divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After being regenerated, we begin to grow by the divine renewing, sanctification, and transformation until we mature in the divine life to be a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Col 1:28; Eph 4:13 , being conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, our conformation is our maturity in the divine life through which we participate in God s divinity in full and are solidified in the possession of His divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God conforms us that we may be solidified in the experience of His organic salvation: In God s organic salvation, conformation is the consummation of our transformation in life 2 Cor 3:18 ; it is also our preparation before the transfiguration and glorification of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Conformation is to be conformed to the image of God s firstborn Son: To be conformed to Christ s death in all things through the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This sealing of the sealing Spirit is like inking, saturating us from within with the glorious life element of God throughout our life, resulting in the redemption of our body Eph 4:30; Rom 8:23 so that our entire being bears the divine image of God.</S>
