   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HUSBANDS A. Loving Their Wives</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul exhorts the husbands to love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The opposite of subjection is ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the apostle does not exhort the husbands to rule over the wives, but to love them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In married life, the wife s obligation is subjection and the husband s, love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The wife s subjection plus the husband s love constitutes proper married life and typifies the normal church life, in which the church is subject to Christ and Christ loves the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. As Christ Loved the Church</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>and Gave Himself Up for Her</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 25 says, Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A husband s love for his wife must be like Christ s love for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that a husband ought to give himself up for his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The requirement for the husband is much heavier than that for the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Submitting to someone is not as difficult as giving yourself up for someone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To give yourself up is to be a martyr, to sacrifice your life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Husbands are to love their wives at such a cost to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They must be willing to pay a great price, even to die for their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. As Their Own Bodies</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 28 says, So the husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He who loves his own wife loves himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this verse Paul twice speaks of husbands loving their own wives.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we have pointed out, this indicates that a husband is to love his wife without comparing her to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this verse Paul exhorts the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everyone loves his body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A husband should regard his wife as part of his body and care for her as his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nourishing</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 29 goes on to say, For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We show love for our body by nourishing and cherishing it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To nourish is to feed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Concerning physical nourishment, it is the wife who nourishes the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a somewhat abnormal situation for the husband to do the cooking for the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But spiritually speaking, husbands are to nourish their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as we eat for the sake of our body, so husbands need to take in something of the Lord for the sake of their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In doing this a husband regards his wife as part of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A husband needs to nourish his wife, to take care of her need, just as he takes care of the need of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the meaning of nourish in verse 29.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To take in something to meet the wife s need reveals a deep love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have known some husbands who were skillful in cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They even cooked for their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually I learned that they were cooking only for their own enjoyment, but they neglected the real need of their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To nourish your wife does not mean to serve food to her.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It means that you take in something of the Lord to care for her need.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way you nourish her just as you nourish your own body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is real love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Cherishing</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Husbands should also love their wives as their own bodies by cherishing their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To cherish is to nurture with tender love and foster with tender care.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the way Christ cares for the church as His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To cherish something is to care for it deeply and tenderly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is to soften it through tender warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, a mother bird softens baby birds with the warmth of her body as she holds them under her wings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Under her embrace, the little birds are warmed tenderly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The heat from the loving embrace of the mother s body softens and warms the cold little birds.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sometimes wives are like cold birds.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They may not argue with their husbands or even be angry with them, but they may become cold.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They may use coldness as a weapon to subdue their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At such times, a husband should tenderly warm and soften his wife, just as a mother bird warms her baby birds by embracing them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A brother who by grace and in love cherishes his wife in this way will surely be a good husband.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The warmth conveyed through such cherishing does not burn others; it soothes them tenderly and even melts their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is exactly what the Lord does to us in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although we love the Lord, sometimes in our experience we become cold birds.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may not rebel against the Lord, but we may become cold.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At these times, the Lord embraces us, spreading His wings over us in order to warm us up.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>By the warmth of His embrace He softens the cold birds and melts our hard hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the Lord s tender love for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>D. Leaving Father and Mother and</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Being Joined to the Wife as One Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verse 31 says, For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christ and the church being one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 , as typified by the husband and wife being one flesh, are the great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For a proper married life, a man must leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife as one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A man and a woman get married for the sake of their own married life, not for the sake of their parents family life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Neither the parents of the wife nor those of the husband should interfere with the marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is absolutely against the biblical principle for a married couple to live either with the husband s parents or with the wife s parents.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Such an arrangement spoils married life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>According to biblical principle, a man should leave his father and mother and be one with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This principle, of course, also applies to the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I know of some young women who became engaged with the condition that after marriage the couple would live with the wife s parents.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Only when the husband and the wife both leave their parents can they have a proper married life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the teaching of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>E. Loving Their Own Wives as Themselves</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Finally, in verse 28 Paul says that the husband ought to love his own wife as his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He also says, He who loves his own wife loves himself.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The same point is stressed again in verse 33.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This indicates the depth of the love a husband must have for his wife.</S>
