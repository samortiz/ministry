   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>On the negative side, we should not cherish any hope concerning the world.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we do not expect any fame, glory, help, comfort, or support from this world, we will never be thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should take care of the way we view the water of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our view concerning the world will surely determine our hope towards those in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men" John 2:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In John 2 the Lord performed two great miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After He performed the first miracle, the disciples believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After He performed the second miracle, many who saw His miracles also believed in Him v. 23 . When we see the congregation growing and the number of believers increasing through our preaching, our hearts subconsciously go to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the Lord was not this way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 24 says, "But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He would not take any enjoyment from men.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not entrust Himself to men because He knew that they would eventually be the ones to crucify Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord was glad when so many believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But He would not entrust Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He would not allow them to gain His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The work might be successful, but it did not occupy His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why He could maintain His transcendency.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"I do not receive glory from men" John 5:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this chapter there was a man who was ill for thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was healed by the Lord in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After this, many who had opposed Him no longer opposed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many were giving glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the Lord Jesus said, "I do not receive glory from men."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord said that He would not receive glory from men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We would have gladly welcomed glory from men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we expect glory from men, we will rejoice when men give us glory and will be disappointed when they do not give us glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the Lord would not accept any glory from men on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He would not accept anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He did not expect anything and would not accept anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, He was not disappointed in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him King, withdrew again to the mountain, Himself alone" John 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At that time, there were a few thousand people gathering there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They saw the miracle of the multiplying of the loaves and exclaimed that this man was indeed their king.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although many people exalted the Lord, He rejected them all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He would not receive glory from men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He would not take anything from men and drink of the water of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The God within Him was enough to satisfy His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was why He could reject everything that the world would give Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To "withdraw" is the best attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Withdrawing will preserve a worker of the Lord from the damage of being uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Withdrawing gives a person the opportunity to prove that God is the satisfaction; it is also the result of being satisfied in God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"His brothers therefore said to Him, Depart from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may behold Your works which You are doing; for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known openly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If You do these things, manifest Yourself to the world...Jesus therefore said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready...And having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee" John 7:3-4, 6, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time, the brothers of the Lord thought that He could become famous by performing more miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, they said to the Lord, "If You want a name, You should go to places with many people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If Your disciples had not seen You, they would not have believed in You, and if the Jews do not see You, they will not believe in You either.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Jerusalem is a big place and has many people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If You go there, men will believe in You, and You will be famous."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet the Lord "remained in Galilee."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although it was an easy thing to move to another place, and although such a move would have given Him many conveniences, He would not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Most people are curious and many will utter praises out of curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the Lord had accommodated them, there would have been hundreds of opportunities for Him to receive praise.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the Lord did not entrust Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He did not want special praises from men.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He had something within Him and had no need of any outward thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He knew the nature of the water of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why He could say to the few women who wept for Him when He was crucified on the cross, "Do not weep over Me, but weep over yourselves and over your children" Luke 23:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He was not disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this chapter, we see the most glorious day the Lord had on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Not only did many Jews believe in Him, and not only did His friends believe in Him, even the Pharisees said to one another, "You see that you are not doing anything worthwhile; behold, the world has gone after Him" John 12:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not only did His enemies concede their defeat, His friends trust in Him, and the Jews believe in Him, but the Gentiles also believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At that time, a few Greeks asked Philip to tell the Lord Jesus that they wanted to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These groups of people all confessed that this was the day of victory for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we were in such a situation, we would have been riding on the clouds and basking in our own glory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But what did the Lord Jesus do?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At that very instant, He told His disciples, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord said this with reference to His own death see 12:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It seems as if the Lord was saying to Philip, "The way the Father has commissioned me to take is not always one that rides into Jerusalem on a donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is not always a way that men welcome."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The world was willing to give everything to Him, but He did not enjoy it and would not accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He did not drink any of the water of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He rejected everything from man and set His eyes on what God gave to Him.</S>
