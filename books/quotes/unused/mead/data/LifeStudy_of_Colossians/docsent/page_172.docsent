   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BODY-CONSCIOUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:17 Paul says that the body is of Christ, but in verse 19 he speaks not of Christ, but of holding the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reason for the change in terminology from Christ to the Head is that our enjoyment of the Lord causes us to become conscious of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are those who enjoy Christ continually, we shall not continue to be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The saints who are individualistic are those who do not consistently enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we enjoy Christ, the more we become Body-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should touch the Lord in the morning, but in the evening we should come to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not normal to enjoy the Lord during the day and neglect the meetings of the church, which is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if your environment does not allow you to attend all the meetings, inwardly you should have the sense that your whole inner being is with the saints in the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This consciousness of the Body comes from the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we enjoy of Christ day by day is actually something of Him as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the reason that when we enjoy Christ, He causes us to become conscious of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to our experience, we know that the more we enjoy Christ, the more intense is our desire for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, if we fail to contact the Lord for a period of time, we shall automatically neglect the church life or lose interest in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The less we contact the Lord, the more critical we become of the church or of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have an eye for the faults and shortcomings of others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shortage of the enjoyment of Christ opens the door for the enemy, Satan, to come in to make us critical of other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if we begin again to enjoy the Lord, the door will gradually close.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, if we are constant in our enjoyment of Christ, the door will be completely shut.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then, instead of criticizing the church, we shall praise the Lord for the church life, and we shall testify how much we love it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What brings about such a change is not admonition or correction, but the recovery of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The dear, precious One whom we enjoy as our food, drink, and breath, is the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because Paul had a thorough realization of this, he could leap from Christ as the reality of all positive things for our enjoyment to the matter of Christ as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since the Christ we enjoy as our everything is the Head of the Body, the more we enjoy Him, the more we become Body-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ is not an individualistic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a Body matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to enjoy Christ as members of the Body in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>LOVING ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 2:19 Paul speaks of all the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The enjoyment of Christ keeps us one as members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more we enjoy Christ, the more we love the other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The enjoyment of Christ causes us to love everyone in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even those whom we find it difficult to love become dear and precious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if we do not keep on enjoying Christ, we shall despise certain ones in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, the church and the saints remain the same; it is our attitude that changes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if the supply of Christ is ministered to us and we begin to enjoy Him again, all the members of the Body will once again become lovable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We shall have the pleasant realization that, as members of the Body, we love all the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is the enjoyment of Christ which causes Him to be the Head in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ cannot be our Head subjectively and experientially unless we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may be told again and again that Christ is the Head of the Body, but you will not have any consciousness of Him as the Head unless you enjoy Him regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more you enjoy Christ, the more you will realize experientially that the very Christ you enjoy is the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This realization will make you conscious of the Body and cause you to love all the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>BROUGHT INTO RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1:18 Paul says, And He is the Head of the Body, the church; Who is the beginning, Firstborn from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fact that Christ is the Firstborn from among the dead indicates that He is the Head of the Body in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before His resurrection, Christ was not yet the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ephesians 1 indicates that after His resurrection and ascension, Christ was made the Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, Christ s headship is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because Christ s headship is in resurrection, the enjoyment of Christ spontaneously brings us into resurrection and saves us from our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all are natural.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are not brought into resurrection through the enjoyment of Christ, we shall remain in our natural person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord that the enjoyment of Christ brings us into resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we enjoy Him, the less natural we are.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once again, this is not a mere doctrine, but a fact of Christian experience.</S>
