Grant us Your rich blessing. We need Your presence. Your Spirit is just Your presence. Lord, open Yourself to us. We open ourselves to You and to one another. Grant us an open fellowship, a fellowship that is so free, so refreshing, in the spirit, a fellowship that overcomes all kinds of frustrations. Lord, thank You that we are here with You, believing that You are here with us. We are not only one with You, but today we are just You. We are parts of You. Lord, bless Your Body. Amen.</P><P>Since the autumn of 1987 there has been a turmoil in the Lord's recovery. In this turmoil a number of crucial terms among us have been devastated. The most devastated term is the ministry. Those who are carrying on the present turmoil have misunderstood, wrongly applied, and evilly interpreted this term. Two other crucial terms among us that have also been damaged are the teaching of the apostles and the fellowship of the apostles. In this message we will consider the matter of the ministry of the New Testament. In the subsequent message we will consider the teaching of the apostles and the fellowship of the apostles.</P><P>From the beginning of the Lord's recovery with Brother Nee there have been turmoils in the recovery caused by the evil one, Satan. In order to face the turmoils at his time, Brother Nee gave a number of messages that dealt with particular terms that were being misunderstood and misapplied by the dissenting ones. During that time Brother Nee spoke very much concerning the matter of the ministry. A number of books on the ministry were published by Brother Nee, and a number have also been published by us in the United States in the past thirty years (see The Normal Christian Church Life, by Watchman Nee, and Elders' Training, Book 1&#151;The Ministry of the New Testament, by Witness Lee, published by Living Stream Ministry). The speaking of the ministry in the Lord's recovery has covered this matter in full. Those who are devastating these terms among us have a purpose. What they are doing is neither fair nor reasonable nor considerate. In order to carry out their particular purpose, they have done their best to devastate the term the ministry.</P><P>In order to consider this matter, we need to come back to the Word. The Word is our "constitution." To come to the Word is to come to the heavenly court. We do have a constitutional book&#151;the Bible&#151;in our hand with a number of good verses concerning the matter of the ministry. We need to be familiar with these verses and pray-read these verses. Whenever people who know the law touch the constitution, none would do it carelessly. No one would do it without thorough, adequate consideration. Likewise, we need to come to the Word concerning the matter of the ministry and touch this matter carefully and with a thorough consideration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO COVENANTS AND TWO MINISTRIES</H2><P>No other portion in the Bible shows us the matter of the ministry more clearly than 2 Corinthians 3 and 4. First, in these chapters Paul touches the matter of the ministry based upon God's covenants, the new covenant and the old covenant. Without God's covenant, there is no possibility to have any ministry. A ministry is to carry out what God has covenanted with His people. Without God's covenant, we do not have any work to do. Without God's covenant, whatever we may do cannot be considered a ministry. The ministry is just the service that we render to God to carry out God's covenant. Whatever we may do to carry out our own preference or desires is not a ministry of God but is merely a human work.</P><P>In the whole universe only two covenants are crucial. In the New Testament time God covenanted only once with His people. This covenant is the new covenant, which the Lord Jesus enacted at His table. At the time when the Lord Jesus established His table, He enacted the new covenant with the blood that He would shed for us (Matt. 26:28; Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20). In the Old Testament time God covenanted with His people a number of times (see Truth Lessons, Level Two, Volume 1, published by Living Stream Ministry), but the main covenant was the law. In the New Testament the covenant of the law is called "the old covenant" (2 Cor. 3:14). In Jeremiah 31:31-34 God told His people that the old covenant of the law did not work well and did not serve His purpose, so He would make a new covenant, not with the Israel of the Old Testament but with His New Testament people, the believers in Christ, and with the remnant of Israel at the end of the New Testament age. This is not a covenant of law but a covenant of grace. Based on the old covenant of the law, there was an old covenant ministry, and based on the new covenant of the New Testament, there is the ministry of the new covenant (2 Cor. 3:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT<br>BEING UNIQUELY ONE UNIVERSALLY</H2><P>We all need to be clear that the ministry of the New Testament, which is the ministry of the new covenant, is uniquely one universally.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Ministry of the Spirit and<br>of Righteousness of the New Covenant<br>in Contrast with the Ministry of Death and<br>of Condemnation of the Old Covenant</H2><P>In the entire universe there have been only two ministries. In 2 Corinthians 3 the ministry of the old covenant is referred to as "the ministry of death" and "the ministry of condemnation" (vv. 7, 9). The ministry of the old covenant did only two things: it condemned people and put people to death. But the new covenant and the new ministry based on the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness, that is, of justification (vv. 8, 9). The old covenant ministry of Moses was a ministry of death and condemnation, but the new covenant ministry is the exact opposite: it is a ministry not of death but of the Spirit, that is, of life, and not of condemnation but of righteousness for God's justification. Thus, we may say that the ministry of the old covenant was a ministry of death and condemnation, and the ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of life and justification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Comprising All the Works (Ministries)<br>of All the Apostles, the Ministers<br>of the New Covenant</H2><P>The unique ministry of the New Testament comprises all the works (ministries) of all the apostles, the ministers of the new covenant. In 2 Corinthians 3 the plural ministers is used clearly in verse 6, and the singular ministry is used in verses 8 and 9. Then, in the first verse of chapter four Paul said, "Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart." Here Paul used the plural pronoun we. He did not say that he (singular) had this ministry; rather, he said that we (plural) have this ministry (singular). We here includes not only Paul but all the New Testament ministers. All this indicates that there is one new covenant ministry of many new covenant ministers.</P><P>The first of the new covenant ministers were the twelve apostles. In Acts 1:17 and 25 Peter used the term this ministry. That ministry was the ministry of the twelve apostles, who were the first twelve New Testament ministers. The ministry is the service, the work, and the ministers are the persons who serve. The persons who serve are many. After the twelve apostles, many ministers, including Paul, Barnabas, and many others, entered into the ministry. Although the ministers were many, all these many ministers had only one ministry.</P><P>In 2 Corinthians 4:1 Paul used the pronoun we, referring to many ministers. Then in 2 Timothy 4:5 Paul charged Timothy to fully accomplish his ministry. In this verse Paul spoke of Timothy's ministry, referring to an individual's ministry. This was Timothy's personal ministry, but this personal ministry was a part of the corporate ministry, "this ministry," the unique ministry of the New Testament. The ministry in 2 Corinthians 4:1 is the corporate ministry of all the New Testament ministers. In this corporate ministry Paul had his portion, Peter had his portion, and Timothy had his portion. All the ministers have their own portion of the ministry. When we add all the portions together, we have "this ministry," which is the New Testament ministry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Accomplish God's New Testament Economy concerning the Church in<br>the Building Up of the Body of Christ</H2><P>The work of the New Testament ministry is to accomplish God's New Testament economy concerning the church (Eph. 3:9-10) in the building up of the Body of Christ. Ephesians 4:12 says that all the saints need to be perfected "unto the work of the ministry." This means that hundreds and even thousands of saints can be perfected unto the work of the ministry. In this verse the term the ministry is used. No doubt this refers to the unique ministry of the New Testament to carry out God's eternal purpose, which is contained in the new covenant. God's new covenant contains God's economy. To carry out this economy requires much work, and that work is the ministry. In Ephesians 4:12 the phrase unto the building up of the Body of Christ appears in apposition to unto the work of the ministry. This indicates clearly that to do the work of the ministry is to build up the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT MANY MINISTRIES, BUT ONLY ONE MINISTRY</H2><P>When we consider all these verses together and put them together rightly, like the pieces of a puzzle, we can see a picture showing us clearly that the New Testament ministry is the service, the work, in totality of all the New Testament ministers. In this ministry Timothy had a part called Timothy's ministry. You also have a part called "your ministry," and I also have a part called "my ministry." However, this does not mean that in the New Testament there is one ministry, and then in addition to this one ministry there are many other ministries. The ministry of the New Testament is uniquely one, but there are many ministers who have a part in this one ministry.</P><P>In recent years some of the dissenting ones have said that they accept all ministries. In saying "all ministries" they seem to have the concept that the new covenant has many ministries. However, this is wrong. Since there is only one new covenant, how could there be many new covenant ministries? Many workers may have a part in constructing a building, but they do not carry out many different works. Rather, they carry out only one work. That one work is not done according to anyone's opinion but is carried out under one superintendent, one master builder (1 Cor. 3:10), and according to the unique copy of the blueprint. The one blueprint eliminates all opinions. Every part of the work must be done according to the one blueprint and under the leadership of the one master builder. In this way all the workers carry out only one building work.</P><P>God's new covenant is a great matter concerning the lives of millions of people, yet it is accomplished by only one ministry. In the New Testament we cannot see two ministries. We may speak of Peter's ministry, of Paul's ministry, or of Timothy's ministry, but we must do so with the realization that these individual ministries are only small parts of "this ministry," the unique ministry of the New Testament. "This ministry" implies and includes all the ministers' pieces of the ministry. A jigsaw puzzle does not portray two pictures; each puzzle shows only one picture. This picture is composed of many pieces. If we have the ability to put the pieces together properly, eventually we will see just one picture. Likewise, when we put all the individual ministries of the New Testament ministers together, we have just one ministry, the unique ministry of the New Testament.</P><P>The ministry denotes the unique new covenant ministry for the building up of one building, the Body of Christ, and this ministry is the unique service of thousands of New Testament ministers. Every member of the Body of Christ has a part of this ministry. Although every believer has a part of the ministry, their parts are not separate ministries but are only parts of the one ministry. The carrying out of God's new covenant requires only one ministry. If there is more than one ministry, trouble will result. I hope that this matter will be made clear to all the dear saints in the Lord's recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALL THE WORKS (THE MINISTRIES)<br>OF THE TEACHINGS OTHER THAN THE TEACHINGS<br>OF THE APOSTLES FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT<br>OF GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY<br>NOT BEING COUNTED IN THIS UNIQUE MINISTRY</H2><P>All the works (the ministries) of the teachings other than the teachings of the apostles (Acts 2:42) for the accomplishment of God's New Testament economy are not counted in this unique ministry (1 Tim. 1:3-4). This includes the works of the Judaizers, who still taught genealogies from the Old Testament, and also the law (v. 7). Such things are not part of God's economy and were considered by Paul as different things (v. 3). Thus, the works of the teachings of things other than God's economy should not be considered a part of the ministry. The ministry is only for the accomplishment of God's economy, which is to build up the church as the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SUBTLE WORK OF THE DISSENTING ONES</H2><P>In the turmoil among us, the intention of the dissenting ones is to condemn me; therefore, they say that the ministry is Witness Lee's ministry. They go even further to say that all the churches who follow Witness Lee's ministry are "ministry churches." They say that my ministry no longer builds up local churches but builds up "ministry churches." Once when several of the dissenting ones came to contact me, they pointed out that in his book The Normal Christian Church Life, Brother Watchman Nee made it clear that the missionaries sent out by the different denominations or missions all built up their "mission churches," not the local churches (pp. 160-164). The Presbyterian missionaries built up Presbyterian churches, the Baptist missionaries built up Baptist churches, and the Methodist missionaries built up Methodist churches. All those churches should have been local churches, not denominational churches. Brother Nee said that if all the Western missionaries sent to China would not build up their mission churches but would all build up the local churches, there would be no division. These brothers brought this to my attention. In my response to the brothers, I asked them whether they considered all the churches raised up by my ministry denominational churches, and whether they considered my ministry a denominational ministry. I have the full assurance that when I brought the recovery to the United States, I did not carry out a denominational ministry, nor did I raise up denominational churches. What I brought to America was "the ministry." Through this ministry the Lord brought the work of His recovery to America and has raised up the churches, built up the churches, and nourished and perfected the saints for more than thirty years. The very work that raised up the local churches in America is surely "the ministry." This being the case, the churches raised up through my ministry are the churches of the ministry and should be one with the ministry.</P><P>Some of the dissenters have called my work of the ministry "the system of Witness Lee's ministry." In 1986 and 1987, while I was in Taipei conducting the full-time training, some of the brothers who carried out the training charged the trainees to be one with the ministry, although I never told the brothers to do that. After that, the dissenters condemned me and the brothers for charging the trainees to be one with the ministry. However, concerning this point I would like to ask you: Is it right or wrong to be one with the ministry? Surely it is right to be one with the ministry (Phil. 1:3-5; 2:1-4, 25, 30; 3:17; 4:15-18; Col. 4:2-4).</P><P>The dissenting ones then went on to say that such a charge to be one with the ministry meant that Brother Lee was going to make himself the "king" in the Lord's recovery, to control the entire recovery through his training. On March 19, 1989, in his resignation from the eldership in Anaheim, John Ingalls declared publicly, "There has been a pervasive control exercised over the church...This control has not been exercised so much directly, but very much indirectly, through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings." John accused me of controlling the churches in the recovery through my video tapes, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings. In his view, I should not minister at all, for whatever I do in carrying out my ministry is to control the churches. Today the dissenting ones are very busy spreading this kind of talk.</P><P>The truth is this: God's covenant has a ministry to carry it out. The new covenant has the new covenant ministry. That is today's ministry. This ministry encompasses all the ministers. What Paul had was a part of this ministry. Peter, Martin Luther, and Brother Nee also had a part, and today my ministry also is a part of the new covenant ministry. To say that the church should be one with the ministry is altogether right. In John 17 the Lord Jesus taught us all to be one (vv. 20-23). The ministers and the churches all need to be one. It is altogether right for the ministry and the church to be one. But the dissenters have condemned this and have caused some of the weaker ones among us to feel uncomfortable to mention the ministry in their speaking. When the elders hear this kind of nonsensical talk from the dissenting ones, they bear the responsibility to make the saints clear concerning the New Testament ministry. We need to keep the truth in order to cover the young ones. Otherwise, they will be damaged.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COMPLICATED SITUATION<br>SURROUNDING THE MINISTRY</H2><P>Today we are in a situation that is more difficult than what Paul faced. At Paul's time the situation was already complicated. At a certain point Paul had a problem with Peter. Because Peter practiced hypocrisy in relation to the truth of the gospel, Paul had to rebuke Peter to his face. At that time Barnabas joined Peter in his hypocrisy (Gal. 2:11-14). This was a very difficult situation for Paul. Prior to that time a problem arose over the matter of circumcision. Certain ones came down to Antioch from Jerusalem to trouble the believers, saying that they had to be circumcised in order to be saved (Acts 15:1). Paul and Barnabas were sent to Jerusalem to have a thorough fellowship with the apostles and elders there (vv. 2-18). Through that fellowship the problem was settled; however, the settlement was not thorough but was somewhat a compromise (vv. 19-29). After that, Paul went back to Antioch with Barnabas (v. 35). Some time later Paul proposed that he and Barnabas return to visit the churches they had raised up, and Barnabas wanted to take his cousin Mark with them. Paul did not agree with this, and there was a sharp contention between them, so that Barnabas and Paul separated from each other (vv. 36-39).</P><P>Later, another factor came in, that is, the factor of Apollos. In 1 Corinthians Paul was trying his best to calm a turmoil in Corinth (1:10-13; 3:3-4). He expected that Apollos would join him to solve the problem in Corinth, because Apollos had gone to Corinth to help the believers there (3:5-6; Acts 19:1). In 1 Corinthians 16:12 Paul said that he urged Apollos many times to go to Corinth, yet Apollos did not agree with Paul to go at that time, but wanted to wait until he had opportunity.</P><P>In 2 Timothy 1:15 Paul said that all who were in Asia had turned away from his ministry. In 2:16-17 Paul mentioned the unhealthy speaking of Hymenaeus and Philetus, and in 4:10 he said that a co-worker, Demas, had abandoned him, having loved the present world. In 4:14-15 Paul wrote that Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to damage Paul. At one time Paul and Alexander must have been intimate with one another; otherwise, Alexander could not have been so evil toward Paul.</P><P>After reading all these things in the New Testament concerning the difficult and complicated situation surrounding the apostle Paul's ministry, I was comforted very much. In addition, I was in mainland China for eighteen years working with Brother Nee. I saw all the turmoils related to his ministry. There seemed to be a cycle of one turmoil every seven or eight years. In 1949 I came out of China and went to Taiwan, and later I went to the United States. In the forty-three years since 1949, there have been three turmoils in the recovery, one in Taiwan at the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s, one in the United States in 1978, and now the present turmoil, which began in 1987. It seems that again there is a cycle, like the cycle of sickness in the human body.</P><P>Those who have caused the trouble since 1987 do not keep the truth and do not have any standard of truth. Now they have ushered themselves into a position of not caring for the truth. They care only to do a work of poisoning others. The most poisonous item they put out is to condemn me by saying that I am making myself the unique leader to be the "king" in the Lord's recovery. This is the hidden point with which they poison people. Today they are still very busy in doing this kind of poisoning and undermining work. According to my observation, I cannot believe that this group of people are the Lord's servants. No servants of God could do such things with the sole intention of damaging others.</P><P>We should not be disappointed. As Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4:1, "We do not lose heart." Paul's situation was quite complicated, but today ours is more complicated because of all the rumors that are being spread in a subtle way. Under this kind of confusion, the only way for us to be preserved is to practice the truth. By practicing the truth, we ourselves learn. Then we can speak the truth. Beginning from the summer of 1988 I strengthened my speaking of the divine truth. Previously, I never spoke as much as I did in the past five years. This speaking did quite much to preserve, strengthen, and safeguard the recovery. Thank the Lord that nearly all the saints in the Lord's recovery have been preserved by the truth. From the very beginning the recovery has been built upon the truth and life. I do not believe that the speaking of the truth in the recovery for the past thirty years has been in vain.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TEACHING AND THE FELLOWSHIP<br>OF THE APOSTLES</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42; Matt. 28:19-20; Heb. 2:3; John 16:12-15; Col. 1:25-28; Rev. 22:18-19; Heb. 1:2; Gal. 1:6-9; 1 Tim. 1:3-8; Col. 2:4, 8, 16-18, 20-23; 2 Pet. 3:15-16; 2 Tim. 2:15; 1 John 1:1-3, 7; Phil. 2:1; 2 Cor. 13:14; Eph. 4:3-4a; 1 Cor. 5:9-13; 2 John 7, 9-11; Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10</H1><P>In the recent turmoil the first item damaged by the dissenting ones is the New Testament ministry. The second item of the spiritual things that was damaged is the teaching of the apostles. Along with this item, the matter of the apostles' fellowship was also misapplied and evilly interpreted by the dissenting ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</H2><P>In the New Testament the term the teaching of the apostles was used first in Acts 2:42.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Consisting of:</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Teachings of the Lord Jesus<br>in the Four Gospels</H2><P>The apostles' teaching consists of, first, the teachings of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels. In Matthew 28:19-20 the Lord charged the earlier disciples to teach the new believers all the things that He had commanded them in the four Gospels. Thus, it is clear that the teaching of the apostles includes the teachings of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Teachings of the Apostles in the Acts</H2><P>The teaching of the apostles also includes the teachings of the apostles in the book of Acts (Heb. 2:3). Hebrews 1:1-2a says, "God...has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son." Here it says that in the last days God speaks in the Son, that is, in the person of the Son. From this we can realize that even the speaking of the apostles in the Acts is God's speaking in the Son.</P><P>Surely the Lord's speaking in the four Gospels was God's speaking. However, we may think that it is wrong to say that the apostles' speaking in the Acts also is God's speaking. According to Hebrews 1:2, today God speaks in the Son. In the Greek text there is no article before the word Son. Hence, the verse says, literally, that God speaks "in Son." In his New Translation, J. N. Darby rendered this portion "in [the person of the] Son."</P><P>The entire New Testament economy of God is operated not in the person of the Father, but in the person of the Son through the person of the Spirit. Because all the apostles are the sons of God in the firstborn Son of God, their speaking for God is also God's speaking in the person of the Son. The firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God are considered as one in the person of the Son. Hence, all the speakings by the apostles are God's speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Teachings of the Apostles<br>in the Epistles from Romans to Revelation</H2><P>The teaching of the apostles also includes the teachings of the apostles in the Epistles, from Romans through Revelation (John 16:12-15; Col. 1:25-28; Rev. 22:18-19). Revelation should be considered not merely as a book but actually as a long epistle, within which are seven epistles (2:1&#151;3:22). The New Testament has twenty-seven books. The first five are the four Gospels and the Acts. The remainder of the books of the New Testament are the twenty-two Epistles from Romans through Revelation. All these Epistles are the apostles' writings. They are the divine speaking concerning God's mysteries in His economy.</P><P>In John 16:12, after the Lord had spoken to His disciples up to a certain point, He said to them, "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now." Here the Lord meant that the disciples could not then enter into what He wanted to tell them, because they had not yet received the Spirit. They needed to wait until the Spirit of reality came. In verses 13-15 the Lord continued, "But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you." Here the Lord told His disciples that when the Spirit of reality came, He would unveil to them all the things that the Lord would attain to and obtain. The Lord was going to attain to and obtain many things, but He could not tell the disciples, because they could not enter into these things; that is, they could not bear them. They needed to wait until the Spirit of reality came.</P><P>This word in John 16 was spoken by the Lord on the night of His betrayal. Immediately after that, He was arrested, judged, and crucified. After three days He resurrected, and in the evening of the third day He came back to the disciples in the form of the Spirit (20:19-22). At that time He was the pneumatic Christ. It was then that He breathed Himself into His disciples (v. 22).</P><P>After forty days the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens openly and officially (Acts 1:9). Prior to that time Peter had often spoken quickly and foolishly (Matt. 16:21-23; 17:24-27; 26:31-35), but immediately after the Lord's ascension, Peter's speaking changed. In Acts 1&#151;2 Peter could expound the Psalms concerning Christ (2:25-31) and concerning Judas (1:15-20), and his interpretation was wonderful. Before Christ's resurrection Peter was merely Peter, without the Spirit of reality, but after Christ's ascension, Peter became another person. He became an excellent teacher of the Bible.</P><P>Later, Paul was raised up. Peter wrote only two Epistles, and these were written late. Paul, however, wrote fourteen Epistles. The first few&#151;Galatians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Romans&#151;were written considerably earlier than Peter's. In Colossians, one of Paul's later Epistles, Paul told us clearly that he had received a commission from God to complete the word of God's revelation concerning God's mystery in His economy (1:25-26). That mystery, which is "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (v. 27), is centered on Christ's indwelling.</P><P>Finally, at the end of Revelation, John the apostle said, "I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this scroll; and if anyone takes away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this scroll" (22:18-19). According to John's word here, after the writing of Revelation no one can add anything to or subtract anything from the divine revelation. Hence, according to Paul's word in Colossians 1:25 and John's word in Revelation 22:18-19, we know that after these two writers the entire divine revelation was complete; no one can add anything or take away anything. Thus, it is very logical to conclude that all the Epistles written by the apostles are also God's speaking in the person of the Son. Hence, we need to consider all the words in the entire New Testament, from the first word of Matthew to the last word of Revelation, as God's speaking through the different mouths and different hands of the apostles. This is the apostles' teaching.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>All the Above Teachings Are God's Speaking<br>in the Son at the Last of These Days,<br>Which Should Be Universally Taught<br>Everywhere in Every Church in the Same Way</H2><P>All the above teachings are God's speaking in the Son at the last of these days (Heb. 1:2), which should be universally taught everywhere in every church in the same way (1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Excluding:</H2><P>However, we need to be careful because in the universe not only God speaks, but another one, Satan, who is competing with God, also speaks. Therefore, we must know what is excluded from the teaching of the apostles as God's speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Teaching of Judaism</H2><P>The teaching of Judaism should be excluded from the teaching of the apostles in the New Testament (Gal. 1:6-9; 1 Tim. 1:3-8). The speaking of God in the Old Testament concerning the law is good, but we should not include this speaking in the New Testament. Eventually, the teaching of the law became an "ism"&#151; Judaism. In the Old Testament Moses spoke very much concerning the law, but in the Epistles of the New Testament the teaching of the law is prohibited.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Teaching of Gnosticism</H2><P>The teaching of Gnosticism also should be excluded from the teaching of the apostles (Col. 2:4, 8). Gnosticism was a mixture of Jewish, oriental, and Greek philosophies. The Gnostics attempted to bring their philosophy into the church and mix it with the teachings of the New Testament. Thus, Gnosticism became a mixture of three elements: Judaism, Christian teaching, and heathen philosophy. It is very strongly prohibited and condemned by the apostles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Teaching of Asceticism</H2><P>The teaching of asceticism is included in Gnosticism. In the New Testament the teaching of asceticism also is prohibited (Col. 2:16-18, 20-23). These three "isms"&#151;  Judaism, Gnosticism, and asceticism&#151;are very strongly excluded by the apostles in their writings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Holy and Divine, as the Old Testament Is</H2><P>The teaching of the apostles in the New Testament is holy and divine, as the Old Testament is (2 Pet. 3:15-16). The Old Testament was considered by God as holy and divine, and God charged His people in the Old Testament not to speak His word in a wrong way (Deut. 18:20). God's people were to consider His speaking in the Old Testament as the holy word, the divine speaking, and God's oracle.</P><P>After Paul wrote his fourteen Epistles, Peter in his second Epistle charged the churches to regard Paul's writings as the holy and divine writings of God, just as the Old Testament writings are. In 3:15-16 Peter said that Paul's writing is full of wisdom and that some twist Paul's writings, "as also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction." Here Peter appreciated Paul's writings, saying that they are equivalent to "the rest of the Scriptures."</P><P>For Peter to make such a commendation of Paul's writings is not a small thing, for it was he who was rebuked to his face by Paul regarding the New Testament faith (Gal. 2:11-21). It is difficult to find one Christian who would appreciate someone who has rebuked him. For this reason, many saints have learned to be "wise" in not rebuking others for their mistakes. Including the elders, very few in the church life today speak the truth concerning others' mistakes. Thus, many things in the recovery are still in darkness because no one dares to rebuke anyone. In contrast, Peter and Paul were very frank and strict.</P><P>Paul became an apostle after Peter did. Peter was a top apostle while Paul was still Saul, persecuting the saints and blaspheming Jesus. Later, Paul was saved and was brought by Barnabas to fellowship with the apostles at Jerusalem (Acts 9:27). Shortly after that, Peter received a vision from the heavens three times, in which a great sheet full of unclean animals descended from heaven, and the Lord charged him, "Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!" (10:9-16). Peter responded, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean." Then the Lord said to him, "The things that God has cleansed, do not make common." The meaning of this vision was that at that time God annulled the Old Testament regulation prohibiting His people from contacting the Gentiles. Based on this vision, Peter began to have contact with the Gentiles. First, Peter went to Cornelius, a Roman centurion of an Italian cohort, to preach the gospel to him and his relatives and intimate friends, all of whom were Gentiles (vv. 17-48). Then, in Galatians 2 Peter was eating with the Gentile believers in Antioch. But when some came from Jerusalem, from James, Peter shrank back and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision. The rest of the Jews and also Barnabas joined him in his hypocrisy (vv. 12-13). Paul saw this and rebuked Peter to his face in front of all the disciples (v. 14). When I read this, I was very concerned for Peter. I thought that from that time onward Peter would never be happy with Paul. But in my early days of reading the Bible I found out that in 2 Peter 3:15-16 Peter highly appreciated Paul's writing, even charging the saints to regard Paul's writing as holy and divine as the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Not to Be Twisted by Anyone in Any Way</H2><P>From Peter's word in 2 Peter 3:16 we can learn one lesson, that is, that God's holy writing should not be twisted by anyone in any way. The Bible does need some expounding and some interpretation, but we must be careful when we expound the Word of God not to twist it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>But to Be Unfolded Rightly<br>and Straightly without Distortion</H2><P>Instead of twisting the Scriptures, we must unfold them rightly and straightly without distortion. In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul charged Timothy to learn how to cut straight the word of God. In Greek the word for cutting straight is a word used in carpentry. When a carpenter cuts wood, he must cut it straight; otherwise, he will spoil the wood. To unfold the word is to cut the word. This is to expound the word, to interpret the word. We need to unfold the Word rightly and straightly, not twisting it or distorting it in any way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE APOSTLES</H2><P>Acts 2:42 mentions not only the teaching of the apostles but also the fellowship of the apostles. Any kind of teaching will bring in a certain kind of fellowship. The kind of fellowship we enter into corresponds to the kind of teaching we are under. Fellowship is always based on teaching.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fellowship of the Divine Life,<br>between the Apostles and the Believers</H2><P>The fellowship of the apostles is, first, the fellowship of the divine life, between the apostles and the believers (1 John 1:1-3a). According to the New Testament the fellowship of Christians is a divine matter. It is a matter of the divine life. Without life we cannot have any fellowship. It is impossible for a dog to fellowship with a bird. Because they have two different kinds of lives, the dog life and the bird life, they are in two different realms, two different kingdoms, the dog kingdom and the bird kingdom. The dog kingdom surely cannot fellowship with the bird kingdom. Likewise, a human being cannot fellowship with a dog, because they have different lives and are in different realms.</P><P>A kingdom is always based on life. Since we were born of Adam, we are in the human kingdom, the kingdom of mankind. But after being born of Adam, we were regenerated. Through regeneration we received the divine life and were transferred into the divine kingdom, the kingdom of God. This is why the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God," and again, "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" (John 3:3-6). The kingdom of God is of another life, the divine life. Unless we are born anew and thereby receive the divine life, we cannot see the kingdom of God, because we do not have the capacity. This requires the divine life.</P><P>The apostles' teaching brings the divine life to us. When we receive the divine life through the apostles' teaching, in that life we immediately have fellowship. Regardless of our race or nationality, as long as we are saved, when we come together there is spontaneously a fellowship among us. Our meeting together is very harmonious because we all have been brought into the divine life, and in the divine life we have fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fellowship of the Divine Life,<br>between the Apostles and God</H2><P>In 1 John 1:1-3 the apostle John told the believers that he brought in the fellowship through the divine life. Thus, between the apostles and the believers there is something that is called fellowship. Then the apostle said that this fellowship is not only a fellowship between the believers and the apostles but also a fellowship between the apostles and God (v. 3b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fellowship of the Divine Life,<br>between the Believers among Themselves<br>in Their Spirit</H2><P>The fellowship of the apostles is also the fellowship of the divine life, between the believers among themselves in their spirit (vv. 2-3, 7; Phil. 2:1). Among the believers there is a wonderful thing called fellowship. This fellowship is carried on by the Spirit in the believers' regenerated spirit. Hence, in Philippians 2:1 it is called "fellowship of [our] spirit."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit<br>in All the Believers</H2><P>The fellowship of the apostles is also the fellowship of the Holy Spirit in all the believers. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." These three&#151;love, grace, and fellowship&#151;are not three separate things; rather, they are three aspects of one thing. The fellowship of the Spirit carries with it the grace of Christ, and within the grace of Christ is the love of God. Thus, these three items are just one divine gift as a portion to us, that is, the Triune God Himself in three aspects: in the Father as love, in the Son as grace, and in the Spirit as the fellowship, the application.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fellowship of the Body of Christ<br>in the Oneness of the Spirit</H2><P>This fellowship is the fellowship of the Body of Christ in the oneness of the Spirit. Ephesians 4:3 tells us to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit, and then verse 4 follows immediately to say, "One Body and one Spirit." These two verses indicate that the oneness of the Spirit is just the fellowship of the Body of Christ. This fellowship of the Body is in the oneness of the Spirit. If we do not have the oneness of the Spirit, we are not enjoying the fellowship of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Exclusions from the Unique Fellowship<br>of the Body of Christ</H2><P>According to the New Testament there are four kinds of exclusions from the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Removal of the Believers Living in Gross Sins</H2><P>The believers who live in gross sins should be excluded from the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ. Some of the believers in Corinth not only committed gross sins occasionally but also lived in gross sins. In 1 Corinthians 5:9-13 the apostle taught us to remove this kind of person from our midst. However, many Christians interpret the word remove as excommunicate. This is a mistake. The sense here is not excommunicate but remove. The removing here is not an excommunication but a form of quarantining, as is used to isolate those who are sick of a contagious disease (cf. 2 Cor. 2:1-8).</P><P>In his writing of 1 Corinthians 5:13 Paul quoted the word remove from the Septuagint. In Leviticus and Numbers God charged the Israelites to "remove" a leper from their fellowship that this one might be healed (Lev. 13:45-46). After his healing, such a one was to be brought back into the fellowship (Lev. 14). The dealing here with a leper was a quarantining. This, not excommunication, is what is meant in 1 Corinthians 5:13 by the removal of one who is living in gross sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Rejection of the Heretics Who Go Beyond<br>and Do Not Abide in the Teaching of Christ, Especially concerning Christ's<br>Divine and Human Person</H2><P>The heretics who go beyond and do not abide in the teaching of Christ, especially concerning Christ's divine and human person, should be rejected from the fellowship of the Body of Christ (2 John 7, 9-11). In the apostles' time there were two major heresies. One, the heresy of the Cerinthians, said that Christ was not God (1 John 2:22), and the other, the heresy of the Docetists, said that Jesus Christ did not come in the flesh as a man (4:2-3). The Bible reveals clearly that Christ is a God-man. As a God-man, He has divinity, the divine nature, and He also has humanity, the human nature. According to the writings of John, at his time there were a number of antichrists who opposed the truth concerning Christ's divine and human person. One group of antichrists did not believe that Christ was a human being, and the other group did not believe that Christ was a divine being. Thus, both Christ's deity and Christ's humanity were rejected.</P><P>The apostle John charged the saints and the churches to reject this kind of person. When this kind of person who has gone beyond the proper teaching of Christ and does not abide in it comes to us, we must reject him. According to 2 John 10, we should not receive him into our home, and we should not even greet him, for if we greet him, we will participate in his sin (v. 11). This is an exclusion from the fellowship among the saints in the Body of Christ.</P><P>The person who went beyond the teaching of Christ in the apostles' time is like today's modernists, who do not believe that Christ is God. They say that Christ is merely a good man. Furthermore, they do not believe that Christ's death was for redemption. They say that Christ's death was merely a suffering of martyrdom because of His teaching. In ancient times such persons were there already. This kind of person must be rejected by the church from the church's fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Turning Away from Those Who Make Divisions and Causes of Stumbling Contrary<br>to the Teaching of the Apostles</H2><P>Romans 16:17 charges us to turn away from those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching of the apostles. We must turn away from anyone who makes divisions and should not contact such persons to fellowship with them. This is another exclusion from the fellowship in the Body of Christ.</P><P>Some say that the apostle's charge to deal with the divisive ones in Romans 16:17 should not be applied to the division-makers in the Lord's recovery today. They say that Romans 16:17 refers to men who do not serve our Lord, but their own stomach, as mentioned in the next verse, and that the division-makers in the Lord's recovery today are not this kind of person. But we need to realize that in Romans 16:17 the apostle condemns the action of making divisions, regardless of what kind of person makes the divisions. A brother may be very right in every regard as a Christian, but if he makes divisions in the church or among the churches, he should be condemned and quarantined as the apostle charged.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Refusing the Factious (Sectarian) Man Who Causes Divisions by Forming Parties in the Church according to His Own Opinion</H2><P>Titus 3:10 tells us to refuse the factious (sectarian) man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinion. In order to maintain the one fellowship of the apostles in the church, a factious, divisive person should be rejected, after a first and second admonition. This is done to stop intercourse with a contagiously divisive person for the church's profit.</P><P>Some say that in Titus 3:10 "a factious [sectarian] man" should be translated "a man who teaches heresy" and that this expression does not refer to a divisive person. But in Greek this expression denotes a person who holds an opinion or a different doctrine that tends toward division. Thus, the English versions translate this as (1) a factious man&#151;American Standard Version, New American Standard Bible, Marshall's Interlinear Greek-English New Testament; (2) a man who is factious&#151;Revised Standard Version, Amplified Bible; (3) a heretical sectarian and cause of divisions&#151;Amplified Bible; (4) a heretical person causing divisions&#151;Wuest; (5) a sectarian&#151;W. J. Conybeare; (6) a man who causes divisions&#151;R. F. Weymouth; (7) a factious person&#151;James Moffatt; (8) a sectarian man&#151;Concordant Literal New Testament, Berry's Interlinear Greek-English New Testament; (9) a factious person&#151;Berkeley Version; (10) a heretical man, i.e., one given to "lift up" opinions, sound or unsound, and an unstable, unsettled individual who wishes to form sects&#151;Young's Translation; (11) causing division by a party spirit, factious&#151;Vine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words; (12) a divisive person&#151;New International Version. Most of the above translations are authorities.</P><P>In the New Testament we can find at least these four kinds of exclusions of Christians from the fellowship in the church, the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DAMAGE OF TODAY'S DISSENTING ONES</H2><P>As we pointed out earlier, in their rebellion the dissenting ones in the recovery today have damaged the matters of the teaching of the apostles and the fellowship of the apostles. First, the dissenters taught people that the apostles' teaching includes only the portion of the New Testament up to the book of Acts. They said that the teaching in the Epistles after the Acts should not be considered the apostles' teaching. Their intention in saying this is to put me aside, because in my teachings I stress very much matters such as Christ as the mystery of God, the church as the mystery of Christ, God's economy, etc., according to the Epistles. Today the dissenting ones do not like to touch these things. Whatever I teach, they want to put aside. Their aim is to poison the saints so that they will give up anything that Witness Lee teaches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TREASURING THE TRUTHS OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>When we were raised up by the Lord in His recovery, we were in a situation of mixture. Nearly everything that we received from Christianity was a mixture. That was a very difficult situation. We spent a great deal of time to clear up all the different terms and complex items of the truth. In order to clear up the mixture, we spent many years to find the proper way to classify the different items of the truth in the Bible. Therefore, we need to regard the truths concerning the New Testament ministry, the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship of the apostles presented in these two messages as a treasure. We need to keep these matters and study them carefully.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING ALERT AND WATCHFUL REGARDING<br>THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THE RECOVERY</H2><P>We need to be aware that in the recovery today there is a sickness full of germs. Therefore, we all need to be on the alert and beware. The dissenting ones plan to remain in the recovery, and they are now desperate to take the opportunities and create openings in North America and in the Far East for them to work on those who, in their eyes, might be good for their poisoning work. Thus, we all need to be on the alert and pray against this. Such a turmoil in the recovery is not merely a human activity. Behind the scene of the human activity there is the invisible scene, where Satan, the subtle and evil one, is working out his evil scheme to damage the Lord's recovery. We are not fighting against blood and flesh but against the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies (Eph. 6:12). Christ through His death on the cross has destroyed the one who has the might of death, that is, the devil (Heb. 2:14). When we put our trust in the Lord and His work on the cross, Satan is defeated and Christ is Victor.</P><P>To avoid further damage by the present turmoil, we need to practice a strict quarantine over this contagious disease. Whenever any of the dissenting ones attempts to contact you, no matter in what way and in what polite or "spiritual" manner, you should keep the apostle's teaching in Romans 16:17 and Titus 3:10 to turn away from him and reject him. Do not try to exhort or argue with such people or to find out what and how they really are. If you say anything to them, you will "swallow their bait" and they will "hook" you. You are a gentleman, a sincere, honest Christian, and a humble follower of the Lord, but they are under the deceiving of the devil and unavoidably bear some of his poison. It is impossible to talk or argue with them without being contaminated by their poison. Instead of spending the time to meet with this kind of dissenting ones, we had better save our time to pray and get into the Word so that we may have some riches of Christ to minister to the saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING FAITHFUL TO THE LORD AND TO HIS RECOVERY</H2><P>To serve the Lord, to be one of the co-workers, the first requirement is faithfulness not only to the Lord but also to His recovery. We must regard the Lord's recovery and not consider it as anyone's personal work. Merely to be faithful to the Lord is not adequate. We must also be faithful to the Lord's recovery. To show our faithfulness to the recovery, we must consider ourselves married to the recovery. We all need to get ourselves married to the Lord's recovery. May the Lord have mercy on us all.</P></body></html>
