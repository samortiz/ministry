   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To whom was the law given?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It was given to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why then does the New Testament mention again and again the keeping of the law?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament, the apostles, or we should say the Holy Spirit, knew clearly that the readers of it may not necessarily all be Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only a minority of those who believed in Jesus at the very beginning were Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One person asked me once, "You say that the Jews were the ones to receive the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But who are the Jews?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I told him that the Jews were like guinea pigs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a researcher of pharmaceutical products is not sure of a drug, he does not experiment with humans.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, he first injects it into guinea pigs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the guinea pigs die, then the drug cannot be used.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only after the drug is proven effective will it be injected into human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The same is done for oral drugs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, it is taken in by guinea pigs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If it works, then the drug is used.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Otherwise it is discarded.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The same is done for immunization against bacteria.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If it works on guinea pigs, it will work on man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If it does not work on guinea pigs, it will not work on man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I would say in a most respectful way that the Jews are the guinea pigs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God tried out the law on the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the Jews could make it, then it could be used.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they could not make it, then it cannot be used.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God did try the law on the Jews, and they did not make it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that the whole world cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Jews were selected by God as objects of an experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Jews are representative of the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, one sees that the law was officially given to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the principle of the law is given to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is given to all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God gave man the law to forewarn him that man is of the flesh and is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christianity does not tell the sons of Adam to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That is not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christianity says that Adam has been crucified and removed and that the Adamic race has been annihilated through the cross of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man in Christ receives a new life and becomes a new race.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The law is useless for the new race, for there is no such thing as law in the new race.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The law was given by God to the sons of Adam to expose their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If one wants to be saved through keeping the law, he has to realize the serious consequence of the phrase keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once man keeps the law, he will have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But this righteousness would be of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, it would mean that the sons of Adam, that is, the Adamic race, need not die.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It would mean that man can please God with his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps one would argue that he does not mean to keep the whole law, that he realizes that it is impossible to keep the whole law, that what he means is to believe in Jesus and then keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if the work of the law has a millionth fraction of ground before God, it means that Adam did not have to die.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This would revoke the very nature of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christianity is not here to establish a ground for Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not here to maintain the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is here to transfer us to the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are of the flesh, and we cannot obtain the righteousness that comes from the keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since the fall of man, the cherubim and the flaming sword were guarding the tree of life in the garden of Eden Gen 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Why were the cherubim and the flaming sword guarding the way to the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It was to prevent man from eating of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After man became a sinner and had eaten of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, there was no other way for him to go back to the tree of life and eat of its fruit except through the judgment of the cherubim and the slaying of the flaming sword.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God shows us that man cannot eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and at the same time eat of the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Man cannot eat of both.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Man cannot receive the seed of sin on the one hand and take in the Lord's salvation on the other hand.</S>
