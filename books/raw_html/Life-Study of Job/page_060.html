JOB'S DESIRE<br>TO CLEAR UP HIS CASE WITH GOD</H2><P>As Job expressed his desire to clear up his case with God (ch. 23), he said that his complaint was bitter and that his stroke was heavy because of his groaning (v. 2). Job longed to know where he might find God, that he might come to God's seat to present his cause in order before Him, filling his mouth with arguments (vv. 3-4). Confident that he knew the words which God would answer him and that he understood what God would speak to him, Job said that God would not contend with him in His power but would give heed to him. Since, according to Job, the upright man can argue with God, Job would be delivered forever from his Judge (vv. 5-7). Here Job seemed to be extremely sensitive and spoke as if he was in a dream. While Job was speaking, God was silent, apparently not listening to all these things.</P><P>In verses 8 through 10 Job said, "Behold, I go forward, but He is not there;/And backward, but I do not perceive Him;/To the left, where He acts, but I cannot look on Him; /He hides Himself on the right, so I cannot see Him./But He knows the way that I take;/Should He try me, I would come forth as gold." Job could not find God where he imagined Him to be. Once again, Job's word indicated that he was in some kind of dream. He was surely dreaming when he said that if God tried him, he would come forth as gold.</P><P>Job went on to declare that his foot held fast to God's steps, that he had kept God's way and not turned back from the commandment of His lips, and that he had treasured the words of His mouth more than his apportioned food. However, Job said that God was of one mind and did what His soul desired, performing what had been appointed to Job. Therefore, Job was terrified at His presence and was in dread of Him, feeling that God had made his heart faint and that the Almighty had terrified him (vv. 11-16).</P>
