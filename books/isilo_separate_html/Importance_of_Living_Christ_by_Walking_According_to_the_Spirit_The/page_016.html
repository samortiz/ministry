Embracing Every Member</h2>
<p>Second, drinking of the Spirit issues in embracing every member. If we drink of the Spirit, we will embrace every member, especially the weaker and despised ones. First Corinthians 12:18 says, &ldquo;God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed.&rdquo; Verse 24 says, &ldquo;God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.&rdquo; We need to consider the way that God has blended the Body of Christ together. Parents desire that all their children will be healthy and intelligent so that they can have a successful education and career. However, some children are born with or develop physical and mental disabilities. God uses such children to test us. No one desires to have this kind of child, but we must love and honor such children. Similarly, in every local church there are some weaker believers. Such ones may be of any age. It seems that some only make trouble. They may be opinionated, critical, and even rebellious. No elders desire to have such ones in their church. However, just as a family cannot cut off a weaker or troublesome child, we cannot exclude such believers. If we exclude any believer, we are no longer a genuine local church.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12 strongly conveys the concept that we must embrace and love every believer. Verses 21 through 23 say, &ldquo;The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. But much rather the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. And those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness.&rdquo; We should not despise any member whom we think is intolerably talkative, opinionated, or rebellious. If we cut off such ones, we become sectarian. We need to remember that it was God who created and saved every believer. In the past I wondered why the Lord chose to save weaker and troublesome ones and bring them into the church life in His recovery. Now I am not bothered when I see such ones; instead, I rejoice and thank the Lord, for such ones cause us to know how narrow, religious, and proud we are. Troublesome ones terminate our self-confidence because they create situations in which we do not know what to do. The need to embrace such ones may cause us to think that we are not the right person to be an elder. The church is like a family, and no member can be cut off. If we are walking according to the spirit and drinking of the Spirit, we will embrace, love, and serve the weaker and troublesome ones.</p>
<p>Because every believer is born of God, they are all our brothers or sisters. Therefore, we must embrace all believers. We must be careful not to become sectarian. Paul says in Romans 16:17, &ldquo;Mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.&rdquo; In Titus 3:10 he says, &ldquo;A factious man, after a first and second admonition, refuse.&rdquo; However, Paul also says in 1 Corinthians 12:24-25, &ldquo;God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked, that there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same care for one another.&rdquo; The drinking of the one Spirit issues not only in functioning in and for the Body life but also in covering all kinds of weak believers for the Body life.</p>

Not Overstepping Others&rsquo; Ministry</h2>
<p>Third, drinking of the Spirit issues in not overstepping others&rsquo; ministry, which is not to contradict others&rsquo; functioning when we function. As we function, we should always be on the alert to keep the harmony. This basic thought is in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14. For instance, 1 Corinthians 14:30-32 says, &ldquo;If something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent. For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged. And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.&rdquo; This indicates that while one is speaking, another may receive inspiration to speak. If this happens while we are speaking, we should immediately stop and allow the other one to speak. In order not to overstep another&rsquo;s ministry, we should not interrupt someone who is speaking in a meeting, but if another receives a burden to speak while we are speaking, we should yield to that one. In this way there will be no contradiction or conflict among the functioning members but only harmony.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12 and 14 reveal that when we drink of the Spirit, we will function, embrace every member, especially the weaker ones, and not overstep others. Chapter 13 concerns love, which is also an issue of the drinking of the Spirit. When we drink of the Spirit, we can only love, and we love everyone. Love edifies more than any gift. Prophesying builds up the church more than tongue-speaking, yet without love neither gift means anything (14:1-5; 13:1-2). Even if we do not have the gift of prophecy, we can love. Love is not a gift but an innate capacity that every believer has. Furthermore, the divine life is love. Since we have been born of God, we possess the divine life, and the divine life loves. God is the source of life. To drink of the Spirit is to drink of the divine life. As we drink of life, life saturates us. Because this life is love, it causes us to love, which allows us to live the Body life. If we do not embrace all the believers, we are not in the Body life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTION AND ANSWER</h2>
<p><em>Question: Weaker members sometimes say something in a meeting that is not according to the truth or conveys something negative or damaging. As leading ones, how should we respond to such situations in order to care for the church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: To take care of this kind of situation, we first need the basic understanding and attitude that the Body is welcoming and inclusive. Second, if a brother is speaking something that is not profitable to the church or may damage some of the saints, the leading ones need to exercise wisdom in deciding how to handle the situation. The wisest way may be for the leading ones to look for an opportunity to say, &ldquo;Brother, that is good enough.&rdquo; I have seen this done many times, and in most cases the speaking one stopped speaking. If the speaking one does not heed such a word, the elders must allow him to speak a few more sentences before asking him to stop again. However, we need to avoid direct contradiction or argument. If a leading brother stands up to interrupt the speaking one and immediately tries to correct what he has spoken, this will only do further damage. We should not address what has been spoken until a later time. Furthermore, the leading one who asks the speaking brother to stop should not be the one to speak next. He should allow the meeting to continue under the leading of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The effect of negative speaking on a local church depends on the spiritual education of the saints. If their spiritual education is adequate, another member will immediately stand up to speak something positive. However, it should not relate directly to the negative speaking. When someone&rsquo;s negative speaking touches a certain subject, the whole congregation should ignore the subject in that meeting. It is wise to wait for another time. Perhaps six months later, the proper time will come for a leading one to speak something that will heal the wound or recover the loss.</p>
<p>The church is not a battleground. We should not have a combative atmosphere in any church meeting. Even if someone comes with the intention to argue, we should not respond or react. In this way the church will remain orderly. First Corinthians 14:33 says, &ldquo;God is not a God of confusion but of peace.&rdquo; Verse 40 says, &ldquo;All things must be done becomingly and in order.&rdquo; Some incorrectly interpret these verses to mean that those who attend a meeting should stay seated and quiet and that the meeting should follow a set program. However, according to the context, the main thought of the apostle Paul in writing this is that we should not contradict others or argue when we speak in the meetings.</p>
<p>As leading ones of the church, we have to take care of the meetings. Just as in a family, we should not cast out the weaker and troublesome ones, but we sometimes have to act to protect them and the rest of the family. If a young boy is playing with a knife, his older brother should do something to wisely remove the knife so that the young one does not injure himself or others. This should be done not to exclude the child but to protect him and the rest of the family. We need wisdom for this. Our basic concept and attitude should be to embrace everyone. While keeping this basic attitude, we need to exercise our spirit to receive wisdom from the Lord concerning how to handle each case.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
