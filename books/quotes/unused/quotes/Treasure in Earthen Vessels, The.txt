Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God'
For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted in everything; without were fightings, within were fears'
Because while his letters, someone says, are weighty and strong, his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible'
From 3:1 through the end of the book, we see the earthen vessel on the one hand and the treasure on the other hand
Corinthians, however, is the only book in the New Testament which shows us the very kind of person whom God used to pass on His revelation
We meet an earthen vessel, but the special characteristic of this earthen vessel is that a treasure has been put into it
We see him bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, but the life of Jesus was manifested in his body
He said, 'My power will tabernacle over your weakness,' which means 'My power will overshadow or cover your weakness'
They said that his speech was contemptible , that he took them by guile , and that he was fickle and said 'Yes, yes' and 'No, no'
Thank the Lord, however, that there were probably one hundred letters in her wastepaper basket which had never been mailed

The sick ones are still ill, the sons and spouses are still unrepentant, and the difficult matters still remain

Although we cannot make it we should allow something positive to come in and when it does it shines better more brightly and more gloriously
As we journey along this way, we will discover the immensity of the spiritual contradiction that exists within us
As time goes on, we find this cleavage, this dividing gulf, is ever widening; the contradiction within us is ever accentuated
We find a man whose original traits remain intact, yet God gives him a patience far more excellent than his natural resilience
It is better to see a man in whom God has placed meekness than to see a person who is weak and impotent by nature
All weak people think that they are too earthen; their vessels are too full of clay and they are without any hope
