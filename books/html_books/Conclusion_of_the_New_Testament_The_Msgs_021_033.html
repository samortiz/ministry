OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>In the foregoing messages we have considered the New Testament and God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and also God in His person, nature, attributes, good pleasure, manifestation, and work. With this message we shall begin to cover Christ&rsquo;s person, and in later messages we shall cover Christ&rsquo;s attributes, virtues, and work. As we shall see, concerning Christ&rsquo;s person there are a great many aspects.</p>
<p>We all need to have the vision that the God who is dispensing Himself into our being is Christ. All that God is, is in Christ. This means that we cannot separate what God is from what Christ is, for God is embodied in Christ. When we say that God is dispensing Himself into us, we need to realize that this dispensing God in His economy is Christ. Without being Christ, God could not dispense Himself into us. God is Christ for the purpose of His dispensing. For this reason, in the Bible we have God and also Christ.</p>
<p>Some Bible students have a superficial understanding of why we need Christ as well as God. Some may think that besides God we have Christ as our Savior and Redeemer. They may give the impression that God is not our Redeemer and Savior and that Christ is someone besides God who is our Savior and Redeemer. This understanding is not accurate. It is more accurate to say that without being Christ God could not be our Savior, and that without being Christ God could not be our Redeemer. In order to be our Savior and Redeemer, God must be Christ. This is why the New Testament reveals that both God and Christ are the Savior and the Redeemer. This does not mean that we have two Saviors or two Redeemers. On the contrary, we have one Savior and one Redeemer. The fact that we have one Savior and one Redeemer and that both God and Christ are the Savior and the Redeemer indicates that God and Christ are one. Apart from being Christ, our God could not redeem us. Apart from being Christ, He would not have a way to save fallen sinners.</p>
<p>In the same principle, in order to dispense Himself into our being, God must be Christ. If God were not Christ, He could not dispense Himself into us. Christ, therefore, is for God&rsquo;s dispensing. This is a matter that has been neglected by many Christians.</p>
<p>In order for us to enjoy God&rsquo;s dispensing, we need to consider all the aspects of who Christ is and what Christ is. No doubt, we all desire to enjoy the dispensing of God. If we would have this enjoyment, we need to see who and what Christ is in His person. In this message we shall begin to consider who Christ is in the Godhead.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A. IN THE GODHEAD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Complete God</h2>
<p>Who is Christ in the Godhead, and what is He in the Godhead? First, in the Godhead our Christ is the complete God. For Christ to be the complete God means that He is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Those who argue with this and say that Christ is only the Son are mistaken. On the one hand, the New Testament reveals that Christ is the Son; on the other hand, the New Testament reveals that Christ is God, even the complete God. We should not say that Christ is only partially God. On the contrary, He is the entire God, the whole God, the Triune God.</p>
<p>Regarding Christ being the complete God, John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; In the beginning, that is, from eternity past, the Word was God. It is not, as supposed by some, that Christ was not God from eternity past and that at a certain time Christ became God. Christ&rsquo;s deity is eternal and absolute. From eternity past to eternity future, He is God. This is the reason that in the Gospel of John there is no genealogy regarding Him as in Matthew 1 and Luke 3. In this Gospel Christ is &ldquo;without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life&rdquo; (Heb. 7:3). We all need to be very clear that our Christ was God from the beginning, from eternity.</p>
<p>John 1:1 declares that the Word, Christ, is God. This God, whom the Word is, is not a partial God, not only God the Son, but the entire God&mdash;God the Son, God the Father, and God the Spirit. The New Testament does not say that the Word was God the Son. Rather, the New Testament says that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was the entire God. As the Word who is the complete God, Christ is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<p>In Romans 9:5 Paul speaks of &ldquo;Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever.&rdquo; When Paul came to this point in his writing, he was so filled with the glorious person of Christ that he poured out what was in his heart and declared that Christ is over all, God blessed forever. We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that our Lord Jesus Christ is the very God who is over all and blessed forever. He is the infinite God. Concerning Him, Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;Unto us a child is born...his name shall be called...The mighty God.&rdquo; We praise Christ for His deity, and we worship Him as God, the complete God, blessed forever.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:8 also indicates that Christ is God: &ldquo;But as to the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.&rdquo; Because Christ the Son is God Himself, He is addressed in this verse as the very God. Hebrews 1:8 clearly reveals that the Son is God Himself.</p><h2 class="head3">a. All the Fullness of the Godhead<br />
Dwelling in Him Bodily</h2>
<p>Speaking of Christ, Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; Can you explain the difference between fullness and riches? According to biblical usage, the significance of the word &ldquo;fullness&rdquo; surpasses that of the word &ldquo;riches.&rdquo; First we have the riches and then the fullness. We may say, therefore, that fullness surpasses riches. The fullness in Colossians 2:9 refers not to the riches of God but to the expression of the riches of God. What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead but the expression of the riches of what God is.</p>
<p>What does &ldquo;the fullness of the Godhead&rdquo; refer to? Does it not refer to the entire Godhead, to the complete God? Yes, the fullness of the Godhead is the entire Godhead, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Since the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, how could we say that the fullness of the Godhead includes only God the Son and not God the Father and God the Spirit? This would not be logical. Because the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the fullness of the Godhead must be the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. As the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, Christ is not only the Son of God but also the entire God.</p>
<p>We would emphasize the fact that the fullness of the complete Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. The Godhead includes the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and the fullness of the Godhead is the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The fact that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that the Triune God is fully embodied in Him. Apart from Christ as the embodiment of God, we cannot find God, because God is altogether embodied in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. The Effulgence of God&rsquo;s Glory<br />
and the Express Image of God&rsquo;s Substance</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the express image of God&rsquo;s substance. The effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory is like the shining, or the brightness, of the light of the sun. Christ is the shining, the brightness, of the Father&rsquo;s glory. The effulgence cannot be separated from the glory just as the shining of the sun cannot be separated from the rays of the sun, since the shining and the rays are one.</p>
<p>We may use an electric light as an illustration of the relationship between the effulgence and the glory. Light is the expression of electricity. Although electricity is a mystery, it is a reality. We can tell that electricity is in a certain room by the shining of the electric lights in that room. Light is the effulgence of the &ldquo;glory&rdquo; of electricity. In like manner, Christ is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:3 says not only that Christ is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory but also that He is the express image of God&rsquo;s substance. The glory is the outward expression, and the substance is the inward essence. God has His essence as well as His appearance; He has His substance as well as His glory. We do not have adequate words to explain these matters. We can say only that our God is glorious and substantial. As far as His glory is concerned, Christ is the effulgence of this glory, and as far as God&rsquo;s substance is concerned, Christ is the express image of this substance.</p>
<p>The express image of God&rsquo;s substance is like the impress of a seal. Christ is the expression of what God the Father is. A seal has an image. When the seal is pressed upon paper, the paper bears the same express image as the seal bears. Suppose a seal has certain letters. When this seal is pressed on a piece of paper, the paper will bear the same image with the same letters as the seal. Christ is not only the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory; He is also the impress of God&rsquo;s substance. Here we have the substance within and the expression without. The substance within is the source of the express image, and the expression without is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>For Christ to be the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the express image of His substance means that He is God coming to us. When I put a seal on a piece of paper, the seal comes to the paper. Likewise, Christ as the impress, the express image, of God&rsquo;s substance is God coming to us. Therefore, Christ is God reaching us, God coming to be one with us. The shining of the sun&rsquo;s rays is the sun reaching us. If we remain in the sunshine for a period of time, some element of the sun will be transfused into us. This is an experience of the sun reaching us. Likewise, Christ, the Son of God, is God Himself reaching us and coming to us. We have a God who reaches us, a God who comes to us to save us and to dispense Himself into us.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:15 and 2 Corinthians 4:4 say that Christ is the &ldquo;image of God.&rdquo; God is invisible, but Christ is His image, expressing what He is. The image in Colossians 1:15 does not mean a physical form, but an expression of God&rsquo;s being in all His attributes. This interpretation is confirmed by Colossians 3:10 and 2 Corinthians 3:18. As the image of God, Christ is the expression of God. If a person had no physical form or image, he could not be expressed. A person is expressed through his physical image. Although God is invisible, He is expressed through His image, which is His Son.</p>
<p>To say that Christ is the image of God implies that He is the very God, the Creator. When we see Christ, we see the expression of the invisible God, for He Himself is God. Therefore, Christ, the image of the invisible God, is actually God Himself expressed.</p><h2 class="head3">c. Subsisting in the Form of God,<br />
in Equality with God</h2>
<p>Speaking of Christ, Philippians 2:6 says, &ldquo;Who subsisting in the form of God did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;subsisting&rdquo; denotes existing from the beginning; it implies Christ&rsquo;s eternal preexistence. The word &ldquo;form&rdquo; refers to the expression, not the fashion, of God&rsquo;s being. It is identified with the essence and nature of God&rsquo;s person and thus expresses His essence and nature. This refers to Christ&rsquo;s deity. According to this verse, Christ is equal with God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">d. The Mystery of God</h2>
<p>In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; Here we see that Christ is the mystery of God. Embodied in Christ is all that God is and has. As the mystery of God, Christ is the embodiment, definition, and explanation of God. All that God intends to do is related to Christ.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; in Colossians 2:2 may be interpreted as meaning story. As the mystery of God Christ is the story of God. As the embodiment of God, the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory, and the express image of God&rsquo;s substance, Christ, the mystery of God, His story, defines, explains, and expresses God.</p>
<p>God is a mystery. Furthermore, God has a history, a story. Although God is eternal, He also has a history. Of course, to say that God has a history is to speak in human terms for our understanding. What is the history of God, the story of God? God is infinite and eternal, without beginning or ending. In the beginning, in eternity past, God had a good pleasure, the desire of His heart. Based on this good pleasure, which is the desire of His heart, God made a plan. The biblical term for this plan is purpose. God is purposeful; He has an eternal purpose based on His good pleasure. This purpose is to have a group of living beings to be His corporate expression. According to His good pleasure, God created the heavens and the earth and all the billions of items in the universe. Therefore, God accomplished the work of creation. Christ is the story, the history, of God. This means that Christ is not only God Himself&mdash;He is also God&rsquo;s history. God&rsquo;s history refers to the process through which He has passed so that He may dispense Himself into His chosen people.</p>
<p>The fact that Christ is the mystery of God indicates that He is not simple. On the contrary, He is immeasurable and mysterious. To be sure, God is not simple. He is unlimited, infinite, eternal. How, then, could Christ, the mystery of God, be simple? As the mystery of God, Christ is the immeasurable, infinite, and eternal God.</p>
<p>God Himself is a mystery, and Christ is the mystery of this mystery. Since Christ is the mystery of God, if we know Christ, we know God. But if we do not know Christ, we do not have the way to know God. We may say that Christ is the key that opens up the way into God. When we have Christ, God is open to us. Christ as the mystery of God is the explanation, interpretation, and definition of God. Through Him we know God and even are brought into God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Son of God</h2>
<p>Christ is the Son of God. His being the Son of God implies the expression of God, the issue, or the coming out, of God. Concerning God&rsquo;s existence, Christ is the complete God as God&rsquo;s embodiment. This means that as far as existence is concerned, Christ is the very God. But concerning God&rsquo;s issue, His coming out, Christ is the Son of God. There is an important difference between Christ as the embodiment of God and as the issue of God. Christ as the embodiment of God is related to His existence, whereas Christ as the Son of God is related to the coming out, the issue, the expression, of God.</p>
<p>John 20:31 says, &ldquo;These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the purpose of the Gospel of John is to testify that Jesus is the Christ (1:41; 4:25, 29; 7:41-42) and the Son of God (1:34, 49; 9:35; 10:36). Christ is the title of the Lord according to His office, His mission. The Son of God is His title according to His person. His person is a matter of God&rsquo;s life, and His mission is a matter of God&rsquo;s work. He is the Son of God to be the Christ of God.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16:16 Peter, receiving a revelation from the Father, declared, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo; We have seen that the Christ, the anointed One of God, refers to the Lord&rsquo;s commission, whereas the Son of the living God, as the second of the Triune God, refers to His person. His commission is to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second advent, whereas His person embodies the Father and issues in the Spirit for a full expression of the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head3">a. The Only Begotten Son of God<br />
before His Resurrection</h2>
<p>Regarding the Son of God there are two aspects: the aspect of the only begotten Son of God and the aspect of the firstborn Son of God. Before His resurrection Christ was the only begotten Son of God. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; This verse speaks of Christ as the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. From eternity until the time of His resurrection Christ was the only begotten Son of God. However, this does not mean that after His resurrection Christ is no longer the only begotten Son of God. In a sense, He still is the only begotten Son. Nevertheless, as we shall see, from the time of His resurrection He became the Son of God in another sense, in the sense of being the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. The Firstborn Son of God<br />
from His Resurrection</h2>
<p>Before His incarnation Christ was the only begotten Son of God, but through resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God. As the only begotten Son of God Christ did not have humanity; He only had divinity. Therefore, before His resurrection He was the Son of God in His divinity. That was unique. But by His incarnation He entered into humanity and took on human nature as part of His being. However, His humanity was not &ldquo;sonized,&rdquo; that is, designated the Son of God (Rom. 1:4), until His resurrection. This is the reason Paul says in Acts 13:33, &ldquo;God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second psalm, You are My Son; today I have begotten You.&rdquo; This verse indicates that resurrection was a birth to the man Jesus. He was begotten by God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity. After incarnation through resurrection He was begotten by God in His humanity to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. Through resurrection His humanity was sonized to make Him the Firstborn among many sons.</p>
<p>If it were not for Paul, I do not think that we would be able to see that Psalm 2 speaks of the resurrection of Christ. Paul saw the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection in the word &ldquo;You are My Son; today I have begotten You.&rdquo; Paul applied the word &ldquo;today&rdquo; to the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. This means that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was His birth as the firstborn Son of God. Jesus, the Son of Man, was born to be the Son of God through being raised up from the dead. Therefore, God&rsquo;s raising up of Jesus from the dead was His begetting of Him to be the firstborn Son. It is crucial for us to realize that the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection was His birth.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus had two births. First, He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man. Then thirty-three and a half years later He was crucified, buried, and raised from among the dead. Through resurrection He had a second birth, for as a man He was born in His resurrection to be the Son of God. Therefore, in His first birth He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man, and in His second birth He was born of God in resurrection to be the Son of God.</p>
<p>Romans 8:29 and Hebrews 1:6 both speak of Christ as the Firstborn. First, He was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son; second, He is now God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. The words &ldquo;only begotten&rdquo; indicate that God has only one Son. John 1:18 and 3:16 speak of the only begotten Son of God. Eternally speaking, Christ was the only begotten Son of God. This was His eternal status. But through resurrection He, as a man, was born to be the firstborn Son of God. The word &ldquo;firstborn&rdquo; indicates that God now has many sons (Heb. 2:10). We who believe in Christ are the many sons of God and the many brothers of the Lord, the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>Before His incarnation, Christ as a divine person already was the Son of God. Romans 8:3 says that God sent His Son. By incarnation Christ put on an element, the flesh, the human nature, that had nothing to do with divinity. That part of Him which was Jesus with the flesh, the human nature, born of Mary, was not the Son of God. That part of Him was human. By His resurrection Christ sanctified and uplifted that part of His human nature, His humanity, and He was designated out of this resurrection as the Son of God with this human nature (Rom. 1:4). In this sense, the Bible says that He was begotten the Son of God in His resurrection (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5).</p>
<p>As the only begotten Son of God, the Lord is the embodiment of the divine life. The Gospel of John emphasizes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and as the Son of God He is the very embodiment of the divine life (John 1:4). Through resurrection Christ became the firstborn Son of God as the life-dispenser for the propagation of life. Through His becoming the firstborn Son of God in resurrection, the divine life has been dispensed into all of His believers to bring forth the propagation of the very life that is embodied in Him.</p>
<p>Not only was Christ born in resurrection, but all His believers were born with Him at that time. Hence, that birth in resurrection was a corporate birth. We were regenerated in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, when His humanity was born of God. This birth in resurrection included us. We all were born with Christ in His resurrection to be the many sons of God and His many brothers.</p>
<p>In this message we have seen that in the Godhead Christ is the complete God and also the Son of God. Christ&rsquo;s being the complete God and the Son of God, the only begotten Son and the firstborn Son, are for the dispensing of God into His chosen people so that they may be His corporate expression.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall consider further aspects of Christ in the Godhead.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. The Word</h2>
<p>In the Godhead Christ is the Word. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). The Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of God; hence, the Word is God defined, explained, and expressed.</p>
<p>God is mysterious. He needs the Word to express Him. Christ, as the Word, defines, explains, and expresses Him. Therefore, Christ, as the Word, is the definition, explanation, and expression of God. This Word is actually God Himself, not God hidden, concealed, and mysterious, but God defined, explained, and expressed.</p>
<p>The Word is eternal; that is, the Word is self-existing, without beginning. This is contrary to the heretical teaching that says the Word, the <em>Logos</em>, was created by God. According to the revelation in John&rsquo;s Gospel, the Word was not created. John 1:1 says that the Word was in the beginning. This reveals that the Word is eternal. This eternal Word is a living person, Christ, the Son of the living God (Rev. 19:13). Such a Word signifies the mysterious and invisible God defined and expressed.</p>
<p>This Word as the definition of the Triune God is for God&rsquo;s speaking. The fact that this Word is the entire God means that it is for the speaking of the Triune God. This Word became incarnate as a man, and that man was God&rsquo;s speaking. This means that the Man Jesus Christ was God&rsquo;s Word, God&rsquo;s speaking. He spoke God not only with clear words but also with what He was and what He did. He is altogether the Word of God and the speaking of God. Sometimes He spoke with words, and at other times He spoke with actions. All that He was and all that He did spoke God.</p>
<p>John 1:14 says not only that the Word became flesh, but also that the Word tabernacled among us. The story recorded in the four Gospels is a story of God incarnate tabernacling among us. The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us in order to declare God, express God, explain God, and define God in many practical ways. The incarnate Word is the speaking, the expression, and the definition of God. As the Word, Christ is the defined God, the explained, expressed, and revealed God, the God made known to human beings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. The Expression of the Father</h2>
<p>Christ is the expression of the Father. As the Son He is the issue, the coming out, of God, and He is also the expression of the Father. Because the Son expressed the Father, the Son is the expression of the Father.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being the Word is mainly to express God the Father by declaring, defining, and revealing Him (John 1:18). The more the Son speaks, the more God the Father is expressed.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God spoke in the prophets, in men moved by His Spirit (Heb. 1:1; 2 Pet. 1:21). In the New Testament He speaks in the Son, who is God Himself expressed (Heb. 1:2-3). God the Father is hidden; God the Son is expressed. No one has ever seen God, but the Son as the Word of God, as the speaking of God, has declared and expressed Him. Whereas God spoke through the prophets in the Old Testament, He did not have Himself expressed. But in the New Testament God speaks in the Son, who expresses Him. Formerly God spoke through the prophets indirectly, but now He speaks directly in the Son, that is, in the One who is the expression of the Father.</p>
<p>John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; Here we see that the One who expresses the Father is the only begotten Son of God, who was in the bosom of the Father from eternity past and who is still in the bosom of the Father after incarnation. The only begotten Son was, is, and always will be in the bosom of the Father. The words of John 1:18 are simple, but the meaning is profound. The dear, only begotten of the Father is continually in the bosom of the Father to declare the Father. This is the way He declares the Father and brings us into the enjoyment of the Father.</p>
<p>God is expressed in Christ, and with Christ we have grace and reality (John 1:14, 16). When we come to Christ, we enjoy grace and participate in reality. According to John 1:18, as the only begotten Son of God, Christ is in the bosom of God the Father. Thus, when we enjoy Christ in an intimate way, this enjoyment of Him will bring us to the Father. In other words, this enjoyment of Christ brings us into the bosom of the Father.</p>
<p>Christ is the expression of God in the same way that grace is the expression of love and reality is the expression of light. When we enjoy Christ as grace and reality, this enjoyment brings us into the bosom of the Father where we enjoy God as love and light. Love is the hidden source of grace, and light is the hidden source of reality. When grace brings us into love, we reach the source out from which grace flows. When we trace grace back to its source, grace becomes love. Likewise, light is the source out from which reality flows. When we trace reality back to its source, we arrive at light.</p>
<p>The Father&rsquo;s only begotten Son expresses Him by the Word, life, light, grace, and reality. The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God&rsquo;s shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized. God is fully declared in the Son through these five things. The essence of them all is God Himself. Although no one has ever seen God, the Son of God declares Him, expresses Him, in the way of being the Word, life, light, grace, and reality. The more we receive the Word and have life, light, grace, and reality, the more God will be declared to us. To declare God means to express Him. Christ has expressed God by being incarnated as the Word with life, light, grace, and reality.</p>
<p>In the Godhead the Father is the source, and the Son is His expression. As the expression of the Father, the Son is the Accomplisher. The Father is the Initiator, the Originator, the Planner, and the Designer, and the Son carries out what the Father has initiated, originated, planned, and designed. Hence, the Son, the expression of the Father, is the Accomplisher.</p>
<p>According to the Gospel of John, Christ the Son came in the Father&rsquo;s name (5:43), worked in the Father&rsquo;s name (10:25), did the Father&rsquo;s will (6:38), spoke the Father&rsquo;s word (3:34a; 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:47-50), and sought the Father&rsquo;s glory (7:18). As such a One, Christ also expressed the Father (John 14:7-9). He did not express Himself; He expressed only the Father. He was the Son, yet He expressed the Father.</p>
<p>Because the Son expresses not Himself but the Father, the Son&rsquo;s expression is the Father&rsquo;s expression. Therefore, when we see the Son, we see the Father. This is proved by the exchange between the Lord Jesus and Philip in John 14. In verse 7 the Lord Jesus pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known His Father also. Then He said, &ldquo;Henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.&rdquo; However, Philip replied, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us&rdquo; (v. 8). To this the Lord Jesus answered, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father?&rdquo; (v. 9). In the Son the Father is expressed and seen, for the Son is the expression of the Father. If we have seen the Son, we have seen the Father because the Father is embodied in the Son to be expressed through Him.</p><h2 class="head3">a. One with the Father</h2>
<p>In John 10:30 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I and the Father are one.&rdquo; The Son is one with the Father. Because the Son and the Father are one, when we see the Son, we see the Father.</p>
<p>We cannot explain adequately how the Son and the Father are one. According to the natural understanding, the Son is the Son, the Father is the Father, and the two are distinctly separate one from the other. Although the Son and the Father are distinct, they cannot be separated. According to the Lord&rsquo;s clear word in John 10:30, He and the Father are one. Because the Son and the Father are one, the Son is even called the Father. According to Isaiah 9:6, the Son given to us is called the eternal Father. A Son is given, yet His name is called the eternal Father.</p>
<p>A number of verses in the New Testament indicate that the Son and the Father are one. John 17:22 says, &ldquo;And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.&rdquo; In 1 John 2:25 the singular pronoun &ldquo;He&rdquo; is used to refer to both the Son and the Father: &ldquo;And this is the promise which He promised us, the eternal life.&rdquo; In this verse &ldquo;He&rdquo; refers to the Son and the Father spoken of in the preceding verse. This indicates that the Son and the Father are one. We see the same principle in 1 John 2:28: &ldquo;And now, little children, abide in Him, that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming.&rdquo; In this verse the pronoun &ldquo;He&rdquo; refers definitely to Christ the Son, who is coming. This, along with the preceding clause, &ldquo;abide in Him,&rdquo; which is a repetition of the clause in 1 John 2:27 involving the Trinity, indicates that the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God, inseparable from the Father or the Spirit. In 1 John 2:29 the personal pronoun &ldquo;He&rdquo; denotes the Triune God: &ldquo;If you have known that He is righteous, you know also that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rdquo; denotes the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, all-inclusively, because this pronoun refers to &ldquo;He&rdquo; and &ldquo;Him&rdquo; in the preceding verse, which denotes the coming Son, and it also denotes &ldquo;Him&rdquo; in this verse, referring to the Father who has begotten us. This indicates strongly that the Son and the Father are one.</p>
<p>Although the Son and the Father are one, we should not say that there is no distinction between the Father and the Son. There is a distinction between the Father and the Son, but there is no separation. When the Father is present, the Son is present also. Likewise where the Son is, there the Father is also. The Father and the Son cannot be separated. For this reason 1 John 2:23 says, &ldquo;Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also.&rdquo; Since the Son and the Father are one, to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father. Whoever denies the Son has neither the Son nor the Father. But whoever confesses the Son has both the Son and the Father. Both the negative side and the positive side of this verse indicate that the Son and the Father are inseparable.</p>
<p>The New Testament does not separate the Father and the Son. Especially in the Gospel of John we see that the Son is always one with the Father. The Son came in the name of the Father (John 5:43). He always did the Father&rsquo;s work and will, spoke the Father&rsquo;s word, sought the Father&rsquo;s glory, and expressed the Father. The Son was one with the Father and could not be separated from the Father. Neither could the Father be separated from the Son.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. Coinherent with the Father</h2>
<p>In studying the deep truths concerning the Trinity we may use three particular words: the verb &ldquo;coinhere,&rdquo; the noun &ldquo;coinherence,&rdquo; and the adjective &ldquo;coinherent.&rdquo; The Son not only coexists with the Father but also coinheres with the Father. What is the difference between coexisting and coinhering? To coexist is to exist together at the same time. To coinhere is to exist in one another, to dwell in one another. To say that the Father and the Son coexist means that they exist together. But to say that the Father and the Son coinhere means that they dwell in one another.</p>
<p>We have a word concerning this coinherence in John 14:10a: &ldquo;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?&rdquo; Here we have the mutual indwelling of the Father and the Son. In John 14:11 the Lord goes on to say, &ldquo;Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.&rdquo; The Lord says that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son. What a mystery this is! Because the Father is in the Son, when the Son speaks, the Father, who abides in the Son, does His work. The Father does His work in the Son&rsquo;s speaking because they are in one another.</p>
<p>The New Testament says not only that the Son and the Father are with each other, but also reveals that the Son and the Father coinhere. For the Son to be coinherent with the Father means that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son. John 17:21 is another verse that reveals this coinherence: &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.&rdquo; The Son and the Father coexist in the way of coinherence. This means that while they coexist the Father exists in the Son and the Son exists in the Father.</p>
<p>It is easy to see the matter of coexistence, but it is much more difficult to realize the matter of coinherence. The coexistence of the Son and the Father means that they exist together. The coinherence of the Son and the Father means that the Son is in the Father and that the Father is in the Son. Because of this coinherence of the Father and the Son, we may say that the Father and the Son are two-one.</p>
<p>Some teachers of the Bible say that when the Son came to the earth, the Father was in the heavens. As their scriptural ground for teaching this, they refer to the Father&rsquo;s speaking from the heavens at the time of Christ&rsquo;s baptism (Matt. 3:16-17). This incident portrays the economical aspect of the Trinity. Economically speaking, the Son was on earth, and the Father was in the heavens. But in John 14 we have the essential aspect of the relationship between the Father and the Son. Essentially speaking, when the Son was on earth, the Father was in Him, and He was in the Father. Here we use the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; to refer to Christ&rsquo;s existence in His substance and the word &ldquo;economical&rdquo; to refer to Christ&rsquo;s work in God&rsquo;s economy. With respect to Christ&rsquo;s work, the Father was in the heavens and the Son was on earth. But essentially, that is, according to Christ&rsquo;s existence in His substance, the Son was always in the Father and the Father in the Son. This is a matter of coinherence. The Son was not only one with the Father but was coinherent with the Father.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John reveals that Christ the Son both coexists and coinheres with the Father. John 1:1 says that in eternity past the Son and the Father coexisted, because the Word was with God (John 1:1-2). When the Son came, He said that He was not alone, because the Father was with Him (John 8:16-29; 16:32). Hence, while He was on earth, He and the Father were existing together. Furthermore, as we have seen, the Son and the Father were coinhering, for the Son was in the Father, and the Father was in the Son.</p>
<p>Some have mistakenly thought that the Son and the Father are separate and that the Son merely represents the Father. But the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9). This is not a matter of representation but a matter of embodiment. The Father is embodied in the Son (Col. 2:9). When we see the Son, we see the Father, because the Son is the embodiment of the Father. The Son as the embodiment of the Father cannot be separated from the Father. He and the Father are one in the way of coinherence.</p>
<p>The Son&rsquo;s coinhering with the Father is not for doctrine. Rather, this coinherence is for our experience of God&rsquo;s dispensing. Christ the Son coexists and coinheres with the Father so that He with the Father may be dispensed into our being.</p><h2 class="head3">c. To Whom All Was Delivered by the Father<br />
and Who Has All That the Father Has</h2>
<p>To the Son as the expression of the Father has been delivered all that the Father has. Therefore, the Son has all that the Father has. In Matthew 11:27a the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;All was delivered to Me by My Father.&rdquo; Here the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; refers to the remnant whom the Father has given the Son (John 3:27; 6:37, 44, 65; 18:9).</p>
<p>In John 16:15a the Lord says, &ldquo;All that the Father has is Mine.&rdquo; This indicates that the Father has given all that He has to the Son. Thus, the Father is embodied in the Son (Col. 2:9). The Father has given all that He has and is to the Son. The Father&rsquo;s being and doing are altogether in the Son. Hence, the Son becomes the Father&rsquo;s embodiment.</p>
<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that according to John 16:15 whatever the Father has is the Son&rsquo;s. The Son did not come in His own name; He came in the Father&rsquo;s name (John 5:43). The Son did not seek His own will but the Father&rsquo;s will (John 5:30). The Son did not speak His own word; He spoke the Father&rsquo;s word (John 14:24). The Son did not do His own work but the Father&rsquo;s work (John 4:34). Who, then, is this One? He is the Son with the Father. The Father was with the Son and gave everything to Him. Therefore, the Son is the expression of the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. The One Whom No One Knows<br />
Except the Father</h2>
<p>In the Godhead Christ is the One whom no one knows except the Father. In some aspects or in certain senses we may know Him. But in other aspects and senses we are not able to know Him. He is known only by the Father.</p>
<p>In Matthew 11:27b the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;No one knows the Son except the Father.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;knows&rdquo; here means full knowledge, not mere objective acquaintance. Concerning the Son, only the Father has such knowledge. Therefore, to know the Son requires the Father&rsquo;s revelation (Matt. 16:17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. The Word of Life</h2>
<p>First John 1:1 says, &ldquo;That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands handled concerning the Word of life.&rdquo; In the Godhead Christ is the Word of life. This is the Word mentioned in John 1:1-4 and 14, who was with God and was God in eternity before creation, who became flesh in time, and in whom is life.</p>
<p>This Word conveys the eternal life and is the divine person of Christ as an account, a definition, and an expression of all that God is. In Him is life, and He is life (John 1:4; 11:25; 14:6). The phrase &ldquo;the Word of life&rdquo; in Greek indicates that the Word is life. In His person Christ is the divine life, the eternal life, which we can touch.</p>
<p>If we could ask the Apostle John about the Word in 1 John 1:1, he would probably refer us to his Gospel. John 1:1 and 4 say that in the beginning was the Word, that the Word was with God and was God, that in this Word was life, and that the life was the light of men. Furthermore, according to John 1:14, the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and truth and having the glory as of an only begotten from a father. In all these verses we have a definition of the Word. The Word is the very God. In this Word is life, and the life is the light we need. Then this wonderful One, God the Word, became flesh. This means that He became a man. As a man, He tabernacled among us. Actually, He was the tabernacle. Furthermore, this tabernacle becomes a mutual abode, in which both God and we may abide. Here in the tabernacle we enjoy grace, we receive the reality, and we see the glory. This is the Word of life spoken of in 1 John 1:1.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that the expression &ldquo;the Word of life&rdquo; actually indicates that the Word is life. This Word, who is the eternal life, became a man as a mutual dwelling place of God and us. In this dwelling place we enjoy Him as grace, we see Him as our reality, and we behold His glory. This glory, which is the glory of God, has become the glory of God&rsquo;s only begotten Son. Again I say, this Word is life, and this life is the expression of God. This means that the Word of life is God&rsquo;s expression.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of Christ in the Godhead.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. The Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Undoubtedly, the last Adam here is Christ in the flesh. This last Adam became the life-giving Spirit through the process of resurrection. First Corinthians 15 deals with resurrection. Because Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection, He is now the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 15:45, the first man Adam became a living soul, and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. Adam became a living soul through creation with a soulish body. Christ became a life-giving Spirit through resurrection with a spiritual body. Adam as a living soul is natural; Christ as a life-giving Spirit is resurrected. First, in incarnation He became flesh for redemption (John 1:14, 29). Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for imparting life (John 10:10). As the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, He is ready to be received by His believers. When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit to become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). In this way our spirit is made alive and resurrected with Him.</p>
<p>Acts 2:17 and 21 indicate that if we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive the Spirit. This is a matter not of doctrine but of experience. If you consider your experience, you will realize that when you believed in the Lord Jesus, called on Him, and received Him, you received the Spirit.</p>
<p>Very few Christians have seen that Christ in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit. Some who lack the proper spiritual vision even oppose us when we say, according to the Bible, that Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit. Andrew Murray, however, understood something concerning this and wrote about it in his masterpiece, <em>The Spirit of Christ,</em> in the chapter entitled, &ldquo;The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus.&rdquo; The Spirit of the glorified Jesus is actually the Lord Jesus Himself in resurrection and in glory. When He entered into resurrection, He became the Spirit who gives life. This life-giving Spirit is the essence to germinate a new creation. The germinating element of the new creation is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Traditional theology opposes the truth that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit. In the opinion of some this is heretical. Actually, it is a truth found in the depths of the Word of God.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45 is a great verse. The Spirit in this verse is actually nothing less than Christ, the Triune God, in resurrection. The life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God. God has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now in resurrection He is the life-essence to germinate the new creation. We have become the new creation germinated by Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Some who oppose the truth that Christ is the life-giving Spirit try to make an issue of the fact that 1 Corinthians 15:45 does not use a definite article before &ldquo;life-giving,&rdquo; that this verse speaks of <em>a</em> life-giving Spirit and not of <em>the</em> life-giving Spirit. However, the crucial matter here is not whether the article is definite or indefinite; it is the clear mentioning of the life-giving Spirit. The modifier &ldquo;life-giving&rdquo; makes the denotation definite. Christ in His resurrection became a Spirit that gives the divine life, the eternal life. Do the opposers believe that there are two Spirits who give the divine life, the Holy Spirit and the life-giving Spirit? It is heretical to teach that there are two life-giving Spirits, two Spirits who give life. It is truly according to the divine revelation in the Scriptures to say that Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>To say that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit is similar to saying, according to John 1:14, that the Word became flesh. Notice that there is no article before the word &ldquo;flesh.&rdquo; Would it make any difference if this verse said, &ldquo;The Word became <em>the</em> flesh&rdquo;? In either case, flesh or the flesh, the meaning is the same. In the same principle, the lack of the definite article is not crucial in 1 Corinthians 15:45. The vital matter is the life-giving Spirit. In the Godhead Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</p><h2 class="head3">a. In Resurrection</h2>
<p>It is in resurrection that Christ is the life-giving Spirit. John 20:22 indicates this. According to this verse, on the day of His resurrection, the resurrected Christ breathed on the disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself as life and everything to them essentially.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John we see that the Lord is the Word, the eternal God, who has passed through a long process to become the Spirit, the <em>pneuma,</em> the breath, that He might come into the believers. For the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose He took two steps. First, He took the step of incarnation to become a man in the flesh (John 1:14), to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption for man (John 1:29), to declare God to man (John 1:18), and to manifest the Father to His believers (John 14:9-11). Second, He took the step of death and resurrection to be transfigured into the Spirit so that He may impart Himself into His believers as their life and their everything to produce the church for the expression of the Triune God. Therefore, through His incarnation He, the eternal Word, became flesh to accomplish redemption, and in resurrection He became the Spirit to be our life and everything for the producing of the church.</p>
<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that as the eternal Word Christ took the two steps of incarnation and resurrection. The first step was for redemption, and the second step was for life-imparting. After becoming flesh to be the Lamb of God to shed His blood for our redemption, He became in resurrection the life-giving Spirit for the purpose of imparting Himself into us as life. Not many Christians have seen this clearly. Most believers realize only that Christ took the step of incarnation for the accomplishment of redemption. They do not see that in resurrection He, the last Adam in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit in order to come into us to be our life. But the Gospel of John reveals both steps. In John 1 the eternal Word became flesh to be the Lamb of God. In John 20 this wonderful One took the step of resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, on the day of His resurrection He came to the disciples and breathed Himself into them as the Spirit.</p>
<p>As the last Adam in the flesh, Christ, through the process of death and resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit. It is as the Spirit that He was breathed into the disciples. It is as the Spirit that He is received into His believers and flows out of them as rivers of living water (John 7:38-39). It is as the Spirit that He enters into us as the Comforter and abides in us (John 14:16-17). It is as the Spirit that He lives in the disciples and they live by Him and with Him (John 14:19). It is as the Spirit that He abides in the disciples and they abide in Him (John 14:20; 15:4-5). It is as the Spirit that He comes with the Father to the one who loves Him and makes an abode with him (John 14:23). It is as the Spirit that He makes all that He is and has to be fully realized by the disciples (John 16:13-16). Through resurrection and in resurrection Christ is now such a wonderful life-giving Spirit. This is the fulfillment of His promise in John 14:16-20.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. The Lord in Resurrection<br />
Being the Spirit&mdash;the Lord Spirit</h2>
<p>In resurrection Christ is the Spirit&mdash;the Lord Spirit. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit in this verse is the Spirit mentioned in verse 6, where we are told that the letter kills but the Spirit gives life. Now the Lord is the Spirit who gives life. According to Darby&rsquo;s <em>New Translation,</em> verses 7 through 16 of 2 Corinthians 3 are in parentheses, showing that verse 17 is the continuation of verse 6. As we have pointed out, verse 17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit mentioned here is the very Spirit who gives life spoken of in verse 6. Therefore, this verse clearly says that Christ the Lord is the Spirit. In resurrection the Lord is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Some claim that the Lord in 2 Corinthians 3:17 is not the Lord Jesus Christ but merely the Lord God. However, in the book of 2 Corinthians the title &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; is always attached to the Lord Jesus (1:2, 14; 4:5; 13:14), and God is called &ldquo;the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1:3; 11:31). According to the context of this section, which starts at 2:12, the Lord here must refer to Christ the Lord (2:12, 14, 15, 17; 3:3, 4, 14, 16). Therefore, the Lord in 3:17, as in 3:16 and 18, undoubtedly refers to the Lord Jesus, not to God the Father. Second Corinthians 3:17 is, then, a strong word in the Bible telling us emphatically that Christ the Lord is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 refers to Christ as &ldquo;the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ. This expression again strongly proves and confirms that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">8. The Giver of the Spirit</h2>
<p>In the Godhead Christ is the complete God, the Son of God, and the life-giving Spirit. He is also the Giver of the Spirit. He is the Spirit and also the Giver of the Spirit. This means that He is both the Giver and the gift. The Giver is Christ who has become the Spirit, and the gift is also Christ as the Spirit. The Spirit gives the Spirit as a gift to us.</p>
<p>Concerning Christ as the Giver of the Spirit, John 3:34 says, &ldquo;For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure.&rdquo; Here we see that Christ gives the Spirit to God&rsquo;s people without measure. Some versions render this verse incorrectly, saying that God the Father gives the Spirit to the Son without measure. However, if you study the best manuscripts, you will see that this verse means that the Son gives the Spirit without measure to God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>Christ ministers the immeasurable Spirit to the members of His Body. He dispenses the Spirit into all His members so that they may function in a full way. In the church Christ, as the all-inclusive Head, gives the Spirit of life without measure. Because of this immeasurable Spirit we can function as members of the Body. The whole Body is under the anointing of Christ&rsquo;s immeasurable Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit given by Christ is the immeasurable Spirit, and the immeasurable Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit is immeasurable in sphere and all-inclusive in nature. This immeasurable Spirit is the life-giving Spirit spoken of in 1 Corinthians 15:45. In resurrection Christ became this life-giving Spirit for imparting life. After His resurrection, through His resurrection, and in His resurrection, Christ became the life-giving Spirit. This is the Spirit, the immeasurable Spirit, whom He gives to us.</p>
<p>We also need to see that the immeasurable Spirit given by Christ is the pneumatic Christ (2 Cor. 3:6, 17-18; Rom. 8:9-11). When we describe the Christ who lived on earth, we may speak of Christ in the flesh. The term &ldquo;pneumatic Christ&rdquo; refers to Christ as the Spirit. Due to the traditional teaching concerning the Trinity, some regard the Spirit as a person separate from Christ and then go on to speak of Christ being in the Spirit. Although it is commonly understood that the phrase &ldquo;Christ in the flesh&rdquo; refers to Christ Himself while He was on earth, not many understand the term &ldquo;Christ in the Spirit&rdquo; to mean that Christ is the Spirit. This has made it necessary for certain teachers to adopt the term &ldquo;pneumatic Christ&rdquo; to denote the Christ who is the Spirit. Because of the influence of tradition, if we speak of Christ in the Spirit, others may think that Christ is separate from the Spirit, not realizing that Christ is the Spirit.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;pneumatic&rdquo; means spiritual. However, if we use the term &ldquo;spiritual Christ&rdquo; instead of pneumatic Christ, there may be misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the New Testament are we told that Christ, or the Son, is in the Spirit. The Bible does say that the Father is in the Son and that the Son is in the Father (John 17:21). But in the New Testament we do not have the thought that Christ is in the Spirit. Rather, the New Testament reveals that the resurrected Christ became the Spirit. We have pointed out that 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; This is the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who in resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit and who gives Himself as the Spirit to us. The immeasurable Spirit is actually the application of the unlimited Christ. When the unlimited Christ is applied to us, appreciated by us, and enjoyed by us, He is the immeasurable Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">9. The Baptizer in the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>John 1:33 reveals that Christ is &ldquo;He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In contrast to John the Baptist, who baptized in water, Christ is the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit. Water signifies death and burial for the termination of the repenting people; the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life and resurrection for the germination of the terminated people. The Holy Spirit, into whom Christ has baptized the believers, is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:9). Hence, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be baptized into Christ (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3), into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and even into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13).</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost Christ, the Head of the Body, baptized the Jewish believers in the Holy Spirit. Then in the house of Cornelius Christ baptized all the Gentile believers in the Holy Spirit. By these two steps Christ baptized His entire Body in the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">10. The Author of Life in Whom Is Life</h2>
<p>Christ is the Author of life in whom is life. In his preaching in Acts 3:15 Peter declares, &ldquo;And the Author of life you killed, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.&rdquo; Here the Greek word rendered &ldquo;Author&rdquo; is <em>archegos,</em> meaning author, origin, originator, chief leader, captain. It denotes Christ as the origin or Originator of life, hence, the Author of life.</p>
<p>In Acts 3:15 the King James Version has &ldquo;the Prince of life.&rdquo; This is a poor rendering. Here <em>archegos</em> does not denote a prince; it denotes the very source, the origin, even the Originator, of life, the Author of life. Here Peter is saying that Christ is the source of life, the Originator of life; He is the Author, the Chief Leader, in life.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being the Author of life is for the imparting, the dispensing, of life into others. To dispense the divine life into others is to propagate Christ. For such a propagation we need Christ as the Author of life, as the source of life.</p>
<p>We need to see where life is, where life comes from. The word &ldquo;Author&rdquo; in Acts 3:15 indicates that life comes from Christ. He is the source, the origin, of life, for He is the Author, the Originator, of life. Peter wanted the people to realize that the One they had killed and whom God had raised from the dead is the Author of life.</p>
<p>In Christ as the Author of life is life. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;Him&rdquo; denotes Christ as the Word who is God and through whom all things came into being (John 1:3). Through incarnation Christ, the Word, the Author of life, came as life to be received by the man whom He created. Life is in Him, and He is life (John 11:25; 14:6). He came that we may have life (John 10:10).</p>
<p>Man was created as a vessel to contain God as life, as indicated by the tree of life (Gen. 2:9). However, by creation man was merely an empty vessel; he did not have genuine life. The created life of man is not genuine; genuine life is the divine life, the life that is in Christ. What kind of life did you have before you received Christ, the Author of life? It was, at best, a temporary life; it was not a permanent life, an eternal life. Although it was an instant life, it was not a constant life. Before we received Christ, we were uncertain as to how long our instant life would endure. In a very real sense, before we were saved we did not have life, because we did not have the divine, eternal life that is in Christ as the Author of life.</p>
<p>The life in Christ is eternal, constant, and permanent. All men need such a life, the divine and uncreated life that is in Christ. This life is for man, and man is the receiver of this life. Christ is the Author of life in whom is life so that the life of God may be dispensed into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">11. The Lord</h2>
<p>A number of verses in the New Testament reveal that Christ is the Lord (John 4:1; 6:23; 20:28). As applied to Christ, the Greek word for &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; used in the New Testament equals the divine title &ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo; of the Old Testament. Furthermore, in the New Testament &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; is a divine title of the Triune God. Hence, the Lord is a title not only of the Lord Jesus Himself as the Son of God but also a title of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">12. The Lord of Glory</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 2 Paul says that &ldquo;not one of the rulers of this age has known&rdquo; God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, &ldquo;for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory&rdquo; (vv. 7-8). The &ldquo;glory&rdquo; in verse 7 is Christ, who is the Lord of glory. Christ is our life today (Col. 3:4) and our glory in the future (Col. 1:27). To this glory God has called us (1 Pet. 5:10), and into it He will bring us (Heb. 2:10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">13. Another Angel</h2>
<p>At least four times in the book of Revelation Christ is called &ldquo;another Angel&rdquo; (Rev. 8:3; 7:2; 10:1; 18:1). Christ is called another Angel in this book because He is the One sent by God to carry out His economy. Revelation 8:3 says, &ldquo;And another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him that He should add it to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.&rdquo; This Angel is Christ. In the administration of God&rsquo;s judgment upon the earth, Christ is the Angel standing on the position of One who has been sent by God. In a very positive sense, Christ is everything; He is whatever the economy of God needs. Revelation specifically describes Christ as another Angel indicating that He is not a regular or common angel but a special Angel. In the Old Testament Christ was called the Angel of Jehovah, who was God Himself (Gen. 22:11-12; Exo. 3:2-6; Judg. 6:11-24; Zech. 1:11-12; 2:8-11; 3:1-7). In Genesis 22 the Angel of Jehovah spoke to Abraham, and in Exodus 3 the Angel of Jehovah appeared to Moses. Christ is another Angel; He is the unique, special Angel.</p>
<p>In the heavenly scene portrayed in Revelation 8 Christ appears as another Angel to execute God&rsquo;s administration over the earth in the way of ministering to God as the High Priest with the prayers of His saints. As He offers the prayers of His saints to God, He adds His incense to them. The first altar in Revelation 8:3 refers to the altar of burnt offering (cf. Exo. 27:1-8), and the golden altar before the throne refers to the incense altar (cf. Exo. 30:1-9). The golden censer signifies the prayer of the saints, which is brought to God by Christ as another Angel. The incense signifies Christ with all His merit added to the prayers of the saints so that the saints&rsquo; prayers may be acceptable to God upon the golden altar.</p>
<p>Revelation 7:2 says, &ldquo;And I saw another Angel ascend from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea.&rdquo; As in Revelation 8:3, the Angel in this verse is Christ. Here Christ is unveiled as another Angel in relation to &ldquo;a hundred and forty-four thousand sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel&rdquo; (v. 4).</p>
<p>In Revelation 10:1-7 we have a vision of Christ coming to possess the earth. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;And I saw another strong Angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon His head, and His face was as the sun, and His feet as pillars of fire.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;clothed with a cloud&rdquo; indicates that Christ is coming secretly. The rainbow upon His head indicates that Christ, in His judgment upon the earth, will keep the covenant God made with Noah (Gen. 9:8-17). The pillars indicate steadfastness (Jer. 1:18; Gal. 2:9), and fire signifies the holiness of God (Exo. 19:18; Heb. 12:29), according to which Christ will execute His judgment upon the earth.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that Christ is called another Angel because He is One sent by God. In Revelation 7, 8, and 10 He is sent to carry out a particular commission. The same is true in Revelation 18:1: &ldquo;After these things I saw another Angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was illumined with His glory.&rdquo; According to verse 2, &ldquo;He cried with a strong voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!&rdquo; Here Christ proclaims the fall of material Babylon, the city of Rome, at the end of the great tribulation. As another Angel Christ will shine over the earth to destroy Babylon the great with great authority.</p>
<p>We have seen that in the Godhead Christ is the complete God, the Son of God, the Word, the expression of the Father, the One whom no one knows except the Father, the Word of life, the life-giving Spirit, the Giver of the Spirit, the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit, the Author of life in whom is life, the Lord, the Lord of glory, and another Angel. If you spend adequate time to consider these aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person in the Godhead, you will realize that all He is in the Godhead is for the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen people.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<p>Having considered Christ&rsquo;s person in the Godhead, we shall go on in this message to see Christ&rsquo;s person in the divine economy. The aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person in the Godhead are deep, but the aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person in the divine economy are even deeper.</p>
<h2 class="head1">B. IN THE DIVINE ECONOMY</h2>
<p>What is the divine economy? The divine economy is God&rsquo;s household management, God&rsquo;s household administrative arrangement, the divine dispensation. In 1 Timothy 1:4 we see God&rsquo;s household administration, which is to dispense Himself into His children so that He may have a household, the church, to express Himself.</p>
<p>The English word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; is an anglicized form of the Greek word <em>oikonomia,</em> which is composed of two words: <em>oikos,</em> meaning house, and <em>nomos,</em> meaning law. Hence, <em>oikonomia</em> refers to the house arrangement, household management or administration. The word denotes the management and distribution of the wealth of a rich household. Joseph in the Old Testament, for example, was the administrator of Pharaoh&rsquo;s house, which was so rich that it could supply other nations. There was the need of some management and administration in order to distribute the riches of Pharaoh&rsquo;s house. This illustration helps us to see that <em>oikonomia</em> is a household management to distribute and dispense the riches of the house.</p>
<p>Our Father has a great house with a vast store of the unsearchable riches of Christ. This great house needs some administration, some management, to dispense all these riches into God&rsquo;s people for the producing of the church as the corporate expression of the Triune God. God&rsquo;s economy, therefore, is His household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people so that He may have a house, a household, to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ. In this message we need to see Christ in this divine economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1. God&rsquo;s Anointed</h2>
<p>In the divine economy Christ is God&rsquo;s Anointed, the Messiah. Concerning this, John 1:41 says, &ldquo;He found first his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which translated means Christ).&rdquo; Messiah is Hebrew; Christ is Greek. Both mean &ldquo;the anointed.&rdquo; Christ is God&rsquo;s Anointed, the One appointed by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose, His eternal plan.</p>
<p>In John 20:31 we see that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God: &ldquo;These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.&rdquo; The Christ is the title of the Lord according to His office, His mission. The Son of God is His title according to His person. He is the Son of God to be the Christ of God.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16 Peter received a revelation from the Father concerning Jesus being the Christ. Prior to this chapter, the Lord had been with His disciples for a period of time. During this time, they came to know Him rather well. Nevertheless, one day He took these disciples far away from the holy city and the holy temple to Caesarea Philippi, and there He asked them a question: &ldquo;Who do men say that the Son of Man is?&rdquo; (Matt. 16:13). They replied, &ldquo;Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets&rdquo; (v. 14). All these answers were according to the natural, religious mentality. The Lord then directed the question to them: &ldquo;But you, who do you say that I am?&rdquo; (v. 15). Then Peter declared, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (v. 16). Here the definite article before the word &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; is very important. Its importance is explained as follows. Christ is the anglicized form of the Greek word <em>Christos,</em> which is equivalent to the Hebrew Messiah. As we have indicated, both Messiah in Hebrew and <em>Christos</em> in Greek mean the anointed One. The term Messiah, the anointed One, is used in Daniel 9:26, which says, &ldquo;After threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself.&rdquo; This refers to Jesus Christ, who is the anointed One.</p>
<p>According to the Old Testament principle, anyone used by God to carry out His administration had to be anointed. Thus, the kings, priests, and prophets were all anointed when they came into function. This indicates that the anointing is for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration. For the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration, His economy, Christ is God&rsquo;s Anointed.</p>
<p>The title Christ refers to the Lord&rsquo;s commission. His commission is to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second advent. When this anointed One was crucified, He was carrying out His function as the Christ. Not only His death but also His resurrection and ascension were part of His function. Therefore, Christ, the anointed One, carried out His function through crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension so that God may dispense Himself into us for the producing of the church. From this we see that the Lord is the anointed One to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose to dispense Himself into us. Through the function of Christ, the anointed One, the Triune God is dispensed into us for the producing of the church.</p>
<p>As the One anointed by God Christ is the appointed One. His appointment is related to His commission. Christ has been appointed to carry out the intention of God, the Appointer. Therefore, as God&rsquo;s anointed One, the Messiah, Christ has been commissioned by God to carry out the desire of His heart.</p><h2 class="head2">2. The One Having the Preeminence<br />
in All Things</h2>
<p>In the divine economy Christ is the One having the preeminence in all things. The book of Colossians reveals that Christ is preeminent, that He has the first place in everything. Colossians 1:18 says, &ldquo;And He is the Head of the Body, the church; who is the beginning, Firstborn from among the dead, that He might have the first place in all things.&rdquo; Both in the first creation and in the new creation Christ occupies the first place. In Colossians 1:15 we are told that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, and in verse 18, that He is the Firstborn from among the dead. The new creation of God is by resurrection. For Christ to be preeminent in the new creation means that He is the first in resurrection. That Christ is the first both in creation and in resurrection means that He is the first both in the old creation, the universe, and in the new creation, the church. The universe is the environment in which the church exists as the Body of Christ to express Christ. Christ is first not only in the church, the Body, but also first in the environment, the universe. This means that He is first, preeminent, in everything.</p>
<p>We need to see that in the divine economy Christ occupies the first place, the place of preeminence, in both the old creation and the new creation. Both in the universe and in the church Christ is the preeminent One. If we see this as a vision, not as a mere doctrine, our living and our church life will be revolutionized. We shall realize that in all things Christ must be the first. He must be the first in our married life, family life, business life, and school life. He must have the preeminence in the universe, in the church, and in every aspect of our daily living.</p>
<p>In Colossians 1:18 Paul says concerning Christ, &ldquo;That He might have the first place in all things.&rdquo; In the Bible to be the first is to be all. Because Christ is the first both in the universe and in the church, He must be all things in the universe and in the church. As the first, He is all. God&rsquo;s way of reckoning in this matter is different from ours. According to our estimation, if Christ is the first, then something else should be the second, third, and others in sequence. However, from God&rsquo;s point of view, for Christ to be the first means that He is all.</p>
<p>The first Adam included not only Adam as an individual but all of mankind. In the same principle, in the sight of God the firstborn of the Egyptians included all the Egyptians. The firstborn includes all. Therefore, for Christ to be the Firstborn in the universe means that He is everything in the universe. In like manner, for Christ to be the Firstborn in resurrection means that He is everything in resurrection. For Christ to be the Firstborn both of the old creation and of the new creation means that He is everything both in the old creation and the new creation. This corresponds to Paul&rsquo;s word in Colossians 3:11, where he says that in the new man, in the new creation, &ldquo;there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; In the new man Christ is everyone and in everyone. In the new creation there is room only for Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. The Head and Center of All Things</h2>
<p>In the divine economy Christ is the Head and center of all things. Ephesians 1:22 says, &ldquo;And He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.&rdquo; God has seated Christ at His right hand in the heavenlies, subjected all things under His feet, and made Him Head over all things to the church. The headship over all things has been given to Christ as a gift from God. This does not mean that God gave Christ to the church as a gift; it means that God gave Christ a gift&mdash;the headship over all things. According to this understanding, a great gift was given to Christ by God, and this great gift was the headship over all things. The little word &ldquo;to&rdquo; in Ephesians 1:22 signifies the identification and oneness of the church with Christ, Christ is the Head over all things to the church, which is His Body.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 says, &ldquo;Unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; We have seen that God has made Christ the Head over all things. Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and the new earth. This will be God&rsquo;s eternal administration and economy. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;dispensation&rdquo; in this verse may also be translated &ldquo;economy.&rdquo; The economy, or dispensation, which God purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times.</p>
<p>The entire universe is under Christ&rsquo;s heading up. However, many things are still in a state of collapse because the process of the heading up of all things in Christ has not yet been completed. At the economy of the fullness of times everything will be headed up in Christ. Nothing will continue to be in a state of collapse, and nothing will fall. In Christ God will head up all things. The following stanzas from <em>Hymns</em> 981 speak of this:</p>
<p class="hbody">In His Christ to head up all things<br />
 Is our God&rsquo;s economy;<br />
Taking Christ as Head and Center,<br />
 All is one in harmony.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ as Head will be the Center;<br />
 God within will be the Light;<br />
Christ enthroned, with God, His substance,<br />
 Will fulfill His heart&rsquo;s delight.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 indicates that in the divine economy Christ is not only the Head of all things but also the center of all things. Christ is the center for the heading up of all things in Himself. We may use the hub of a wheel as an illustration. The hub is the center of a wheel in which all the spokes subsist. If the hub were removed, the spokes would collapse. The hub is the center for the subsistence of the spokes. We may say that as the center of all things Christ is the &ldquo;hub&rdquo; of all things; in Him all things subsist (Col. 1:17).</p><h2 class="head2">4. The One Who Fills All in All</h2>
<p>According to Ephesians 1:23, the church, Christ&rsquo;s Body, is &ldquo;the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; The Body of Christ is His fullness. The fullness of Christ issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. Through the enjoyment of Christ&rsquo;s riches we become His fullness to express Him. This is the fullness of Christ as the One who fills all in all. Christ, who is the infinite God without limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things. Such a great Christ needs the church to be His fullness for His complete expression.</p>
<p>It is in the transmission from the ascended Christ to the church that the Body of Christ is the fullness of the One who fills all in all, because the Christ who fills all in all is in the transmission. The transmission connects us to the all-filling Christ. In this way the church becomes the fullness of the all-filling Christ.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:10 says, &ldquo;He who descended is the same who also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.&rdquo; First Christ descended from heaven to earth in His incarnation. Then He descended further, from earth to Hades, in His death. Eventually, He ascended from Hades to the earth in His resurrection and from the earth to heaven in His ascension. Through such a journey Christ cut the way so that He might fill all things.</p>
<p>The thought in Ephesians 4:10 is profound. Christ was in the heavens. Through incarnation He came down to earth as a man and lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He died on the cross, descended into Hades, ascended in resurrection from Hades to earth, and then ascended to the third heaven. By means of such a traffic of descending and ascending He fills all things. Now Christ is everywhere, on the earth as well as in the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. The First and the Last</h2>
<p>Christ is the First and Last (Rev. 2:8; 1:17; 22:13). For Christ to be the First means that none is before Him, and for Him to be the Last means that none is after Him. The Lord told the suffering church in Smyrna that He is the First and the Last. This indicates that no matter how great were the sufferings through which He passed, those sufferings could not terminate or damage Him. He was the First, and eventually He was also the Last. In suffering the church needs to know that Christ is the First and the Last, the ever-existing, unchanging One. Whatever the environment may be He remains the same. Nothing can precede Him, and nothing can exist after Him. All things are within the limit of His control.</p>
<p>When the Lord told the church in Smyrna that He was the First and the Last, He was indicating that the church should be victorious, not defeated by any kind of suffering. The church should pass through all suffering and come to the end, because the Lord, who is the life and Head of the church, is the First and the Last.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. The Beginning and the End</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the First and the Last but also the beginning and the end (Rev. 22:13c). Christ is not only the First but also the beginning, not only the Last but also the end. The First indicates that nothing is before Him, whereas the beginning means that He is the origination of all things. The Last indicates that none is after Him, whereas the end means that He is the consummation of all things. Hence, not only is there nothing before or after the Lord Jesus, but also there is no origination or consummation without Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. The Alpha and the Omega</h2>
<p>In addition to being the First and the Last, and the beginning and the end, Christ is the Alpha and the Omega (Rev. 22:13a). We may be troubled by these terms and think that they are repetitious and that the beginning, the First, and the Alpha are the same and that the end, the Last, and the Omega are the same. But this is not a matter of repetition but of different aspects. Being the first does not necessarily mean that one is the beginning. Being the first simply means that one is the first and that prior to that one there was nothing. However, to be the beginning does not mean only that one is the first but that also one has begun something. What, then, is the difference between the Alpha and the beginning? A certain thing may be the beginning, but it may have neither the content nor the continuation. For Christ to be the Alpha and the Omega means that He is the complete content and continuation. As the Alpha and Omega, the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, Christ is also every other letter in the alphabet. This means that Christ is the content and continuation of God&rsquo;s operation, for He is not only the beginning and the ending but also the Alpha and the Omega.</p>
<p>In order for Christ to be the beginning and the ending, it was necessary for Him to take certain actions. Christ is not only the First but also the beginning, the beginning of God&rsquo;s economy and God&rsquo;s operation. God&rsquo;s operation began with Christ, and it will end with Christ. Actually, in the divine economy Christ is all-inclusive. He is the First and the Last, the beginning and the ending, of God&rsquo;s operation, and He is the content and continuation of whatever God is doing. Because the Greek letters from Alpha to Omega comprise all the letters of the Greek alphabet, we may say that in God&rsquo;s economy Christ is every letter for the composing of words, sentences, paragraphs, chapters, and books. He is the element for composing the story of our life.</p>
<p>The very Lord whom we serve is the Alpha and the Omega. He is the first letter, the last letter, and all the letters in between. This means that He is able to accomplish everything in the divine economy. Christ is the all-inclusive One, the One who is the First and the Last, the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega. Through Him we enjoy the dispensing of the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head2">8. The Portion of the Saints</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:12 says, &ldquo;Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.&rdquo; The portion of the saints here is the all-inclusive Christ for our enjoyment. The Father has qualified us not to inherit some heavenly mansion, but to have a share in Christ as the all-inclusive portion of the saints. We can boldly declare that Christ is now our all-inclusive portion.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;portion&rdquo; in Colossians 1:12 may also be translated &ldquo;allotment.&rdquo; The Greek word here corresponds to the Hebrew word used for the allotment of the good land. After the children of Israel entered into the land of Canaan, the land became their lot, their portion. Each of the tribes was given an allotment of the land. Of course, our portion, our allotment, today is not a physical land in Palestine; it is the all-inclusive Christ. The good land flowing with milk and honey is an all-inclusive type of Christ. As our good land, Christ is our portion, the portion of the saints. How we must thank the Father for giving us Christ as our divine allotment!</p>
<p>Each of the tribes had an allotment of the good land, and the members of each tribe had a share of this allotment. In the same principle, we have a share of the portion of the saints. This means that we all have a share in Christ as the all-inclusive One for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham with respect to the good land is of great significance (Gen. 12:1). When Paul was writing the Epistle to the Colossians and was speaking of the portion of the saints, he no doubt had in mind the picture of the allotting of the good land to the children of Israel in the Old Testament. Paul used the word &ldquo;portion&rdquo; with the Old Testament record concerning the land as the background. God gave His chosen people, the children of Israel, the good land for their inheritance and enjoyment. The land meant everything to them. Today Christ is our portion, our allotment, our everything, just as the land was all things to the children of Israel. The land provided whatever the children of Israel needed: milk, honey, water, cattle, grain, minerals. In writing to the Colossians Paul employed the concept of the all-inclusive land to help us see that today Christ alone is our all-inclusive portion.</p>
<p>As our portion, Christ includes all the other aspects of His person in the divine economy: God&rsquo;s Anointed, the One having the preeminence in all things, the Head and center of all things, the One who fills all in all, the First and the Last, the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega. Such a Christ is our portion, and we are enjoying Him. All the aspects of Christ in the divine economy are meaningful in and applicable to our daily life, and they all should become our subjective experience and enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">9. The Glory of Israel</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s economy Christ is not only the portion of the saints; He is also the glory of Israel, God&rsquo;s chosen people (Luke 2:32). When He was presented to God as a child in the temple at Jerusalem, the old, righteous and devout man, Simeon, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, extolled Him, not only as the light of the Gentiles but also as the glory of God&rsquo;s people, Israel. In the Old Testament Jehovah God considered Himself the glory of Israel (Jer. 2:11). In His incarnation He was extolled by a Spirit-inspired man as the same One. This indicates that the newborn Christ, as the very Jehovah God, should have been recognized and honored as God expressed among them to be their glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">10. The Consolation of Israel</h2>
<p>Luke 2:25 tells us that the old, righteous and devout Simeon was looking for the consolation of Israel. Christ is not only the glory of Israel outwardly; He is also the consolation of Israel inwardly. Without Him even God&rsquo;s chosen people do not have the outward glory or the inward consolation. The incarnated Christ is both their glory that uplifts them and their consolation that comforts them. This is all under God&rsquo;s arrangement in His economy.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover the matter of Christ&rsquo;s person in creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">C. IN CREATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Creator</h2>
<p>Christ is the Creator. Since God is the Creator of all things and since Christ is God, He surely is also the Creator of all things. This is clearly revealed in Hebrews 1:10: &ldquo;You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.&rdquo; This verse, a quotation from Psalm 102:25, is applied to Christ the Son and indicates that, as God, Christ created heaven and earth. Therefore, Christ is the Creator of the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Word through Whom<br />
All Things Came into Being</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the Creator but also the Word through whom all things came into being. He is not only the Creator but also the means through which creation came into existence. Speaking of Christ as the Word, John 1:3 says, &ldquo;All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being.&rdquo; Here we see that creation came into being through the Word, which is Christ. What does it mean that all things came into being through Him and that apart from Him nothing has come into being? It simply means that apart from Him nothing has existence. One day, through the Word as the means, many things came into being.</p>
<p>We may say that, in a sense, the Creator did not need to work in order to make anything, for there was no need for Him to do anything. He simply spoke, and everything had being. According to our concept, creation requires labor. However, in God&rsquo;s creation there was no labor, only speaking. When God said, &ldquo;Let there be light,&rdquo; light came into existence. When He said, &ldquo;Let there be an expanse,&rdquo; the expanse came into being. When He said, &ldquo;Let the dry land appear,&rdquo; the dry land appeared. Through the all-inclusive Christ as the Word all things came into being.</p>
<p>Do you know what creation is? Creation is the calling of things not being as being through the Word (Rom. 4:17). The Word is both the means and the sphere of creation.</p>
<p>We may not differentiate Christ as the Creator from Christ as the means of creation. Even we may interpret John 1:3 as meaning that the Word is the Creator of all things. However, this verse does not say that the Word was the Creator; instead, this verse says that through the Word all things came into being, indicating that the Word was the means through which the Creator created all things. Christ is both the Creator and the means by which all things were created.</p>
<p>Although as God Christ is the Creator, John 1:3 reveals that as the Word He was the means of creation. According to this verse, all things came into existence through Christ. The King James Version of John 1:3 says, &ldquo;All things were made by him.&rdquo; However, this is not an accurate translation. The Greek preposition should be rendered &ldquo;through&rdquo; and not &ldquo;by.&rdquo; Hence, this verse does not say that all things were created by Christ but that all things came into existence through Christ. This indicates that Christ is the means of creation.</p>
<p>Christ is in fact the Creator of all things. The point we are emphasizing here is that Christ is the Word through whom all things came into being. He is the means of creation.</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:3 says, &ldquo;By faith we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not come into being from things which appear.&rdquo; We need to consider this verse along with the last part of Hebrews 1:2, which says that through Christ the universe was made. Scientists are trying to learn how the universe was framed. According to the book of Hebrews, the universe was framed through Christ as the Word of God. God spoke, and the universe came into being. Christ as the Word of God to be the means through which God&rsquo;s creation came into being implies also that, as the means of God&rsquo;s creation, Christ speaks God, defines God, and explains God.</p><h2 class="head2">3. The Firstborn of All Creation</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. This means that in creation Christ is the first. Christ as God is the Creator. However, as man, sharing the created blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14), He is part of the creation. &ldquo;Firstborn of all creation&rdquo; refers to Christ&rsquo;s preeminence in all creation, since from this verse through verse 18 of Colossians 1 Paul emphasizes the first place of Christ in all things. This verse reveals that Christ is not only the Creator but also the first among all created things, the first among all creatures.</p>
<p>Some insist that Christ is only the Creator, not a creature. But the Bible reveals that Christ is both the Creator and a creature, for He is both God and man. As God Christ is the Creator, but as man He is a creature. How could He have man&rsquo;s flesh, blood, and bones if He were not a creature? It is heretical to not believe that Christ truly became a man. Our Christ is God, has always been God, and always will be God. But through incarnation He became a man. Otherwise, He could not have shed His blood on the cross for our sins. It is a basic truth that our Christ is both God and man, both the Creator and a creature.</p>
<p>As God Christ is eternal and did not need to be born. But in Colossians 1:15 He is called the Firstborn of all creation. Anything that requires birth must be a creature, a part of creation. If Christ were only God and not man, He could not have been born, for God is infinite and eternal, without beginning or ending. But as a man Christ had to be born. Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;Unto us a child is born,...and his name shall be called...The mighty God.&rdquo; As the mighty God Christ is eternal, but as the child He had to be born. Some argue that Christ was born but not created. According to the Bible, birth is the carrying out of creation. To be born is to be created.</p>
<p>Some may wonder how Christ could be the Firstborn of all creation since He was born less than two thousand years ago, not at the very beginning of creation. For this, we need to realize that there is no time element with God. For example, according to our estimate of time, Christ was crucified about two thousand years ago. But Revelation 13:8 says that Christ was slain from the foundation of the world. Both are right. However, God&rsquo;s reckoning is much more important than ours. In the sight of God, Christ was crucified from the foundation of the world. In eternity God foresaw the fall of man. Therefore, also in eternity, He made preparation for the accomplishment of redemption.</p>
<p>We may apply this matter of the different ways of reckoning time to Christ as the Firstborn of all creation. According to our sense of time, Christ was born in Bethlehem approximately two thousand years ago. But in the sight of God, Christ was born before the foundation of the world. If He was slain from the foundation of the world, certainly He must have been born before then. Therefore, according to God&rsquo;s perspective in eternity, according to God&rsquo;s viewpoint, Christ has always been the first of all creatures. God foresaw the day that Christ would be born in Bethlehem. Because Christ is the first among the creatures, we can say that as the all-inclusive One He is both the Creator and a creature, a part of creation.</p>
<p>Christ is the Creator, the means of creation, and the first among the creatures. However, because Arius in the fourth century used Colossians 1:15 to teach heresy concerning Christ, many theologians want to avoid saying that Christ is the first among all creatures. One writer has said that although Colossians 1:15 indicates that Christ is the first in creation, we should not say this, lest we be condemned by fundamental Christians for following the heretical teachings of Arius.</p>
<p>Arius taught that Christ&rsquo;s divinity was incomplete and that He came into being through the union of the Logos and the human body. Therefore, according to Arius, Christ cannot compare with God, but is merely the most outstanding, the noblest, and the highest among the creatures. Arius taught that the Word is not God, who is uncreated, but is instead the chief of all creation. He asserted that Christ was created by God before the ages, preceding all created things. This means that there was a time when Christ did not exist. Arius further affirmed that because Christ died without sin, He could be resurrected, ascend to the heavens, and thus become God.</p>
<p>The false doctrine of Arius is contrary to the revelation of the Scriptures. The Bible says clearly that the Word, Christ, was God (John 1:1), yet Arius asserted that the Word is not the self-existent God, and he therefore maintained that Christ&rsquo;s divinity is imperfect and cannot compare with that of God. This is truly a great heresy. The Bible says that Christ is the very God, who exists from the beginning and who is self-existent and without beginning. However, Arius said that there was a time when Christ did not exist and that He became God only after His resurrection and ascension. This kind of teaching is a great insult to Christ&rsquo;s divine person, and we utterly repudiate it.</p>
<p>In saying that Christ, the Creator and the means of creation, is the first among the creatures, we are simply following the pure Word of God. Colossians 1:15 indicates clearly that with respect to His humanity Christ was created. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;Firstborn&rdquo; is <em>prototokos,</em> composed of two words: <em>proto,</em> which means the first one or the beginning, and <em>tokos,</em> which means born, produced. Hence, <em>prototokos</em> means the first one born, the first one produced in the beginning; it can thus be translated &ldquo;the firstborn.&rdquo; That Christ is the Firstborn of all creation means that He is the first, the Chief, of all creation. This does not mean that He is before all creation and is therefore not to be included in creation.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:15-18 says twice that Christ is the Firstborn. Verse 15 says that He is the Firstborn of all creation, and verse 18 says that He is the &ldquo;Firstborn from among the dead.&rdquo; As the Firstborn from among the dead Christ is the first among the resurrected, whereas His being the Firstborn of all creation means that He is first among the created. This means that among the created ones and the resurrected ones Christ is the Firstborn and occupies the first place. The central thought here is that Christ has the preeminence in all things. If He were not the Firstborn of all creation and thereby the first among the creatures, He could not have the preeminence in creation.</p>
<p>As God the Creator Christ is without beginning. But as the Firstborn of all creation He does not come into being by Himself; rather, He has a beginning in creation. As to His being the Firstborn of all creation, He has the created human nature. Regarding the created human nature, He, the Firstborn of all creation, surely is not without beginning nor is He self-existing, but instead begins from creation. This means that as the Creator He is the uncreated, self-existing One, but as a creature, even the Firstborn of the created ones, He has a beginning.</p>
<p>Christ is called the Firstborn of all creation because even before creation God ordained that He should become a created man. Concerning this, Brother Watchman Nee says, &ldquo;In creation, the Son is &lsquo;the Firstborn of all creation.&rsquo; He is also the beginning (the First One) of the creation of God (Rev. 3:14). For in His eternal plan, before the foundation of the world, God ordained that the Son should become flesh to accomplish redemption (1 Pet. 1:20). Therefore, in God&rsquo;s plan the Son is the First One among the creatures&rdquo; (p. 97, <em>The Present Testimony,</em> No. 34, published in March-April, 1934).</p>
<p>This certainly is not in accordance with Arius&rsquo; assertion that Christ was created before the foundation of the world. Such an assertion is without scriptural basis. The Bible reveals that before the foundation of the world, even before anything was created, God had ordained that Christ become a created man in order to accomplish His purpose. Hence, in God&rsquo;s plan and in His eternal view, Christ is the first One created, the Firstborn of all creation, the Head of all created ones. Therefore, to say that with respect to His humanity Christ is created and is the Firstborn of all creation is altogether in agreement with the scriptural revelation and is founded on scriptural ground.</p>
<p>According to the revelation of the Bible, Christ is both the Creator and a creature, because He is God and also man. He is God who creates, and He is also a man, who is created. As to His being God, He is the uncreated Creator, the great I Am who is without beginning. But as to His being a man, He is created; He is the Firstborn with a beginning.</p>
<p>We need to know these two aspects of Christ. We need to see that He is both God the Creator and also man, a creature. He is the great I Am and also the Firstborn. He is without beginning and also with a beginning. The Bible clearly reveals that Christ is the Creator and that He became a creature, just as He is God and became a man. If we confess only that Christ is the Creator but deny that He is a creature, we are in principle the same as those who deny heretically that Christ came in the flesh (1 John 4:2-3). We should never deny the created aspect of Christ. He is the uncreated God, and He is also a created man. He is the Lord of creation, and He is also a creature, even the Firstborn of all creation.</p><h2 class="head2">4. The Beginning of the Creation</h2>
<p>In Revelation 3:14 we see that Christ is the beginning of the creation. He is the origination of the creation of God. This is an important concept. Some translators have said that Christ is the Originator, not the origination. However, the meaning here is not originator but origination. Christ is the origination of God&rsquo;s action to create the universe.</p>
<p>We may say that as the beginning of the creation Christ is God&rsquo;s &ldquo;prototype.&rdquo; In manufacturing often a prototype is made, and the mass production follows later. Such a prototype is the beginning of what is to be produced. Christ is the Firstborn of all creation and the beginning of creation. He is the first in creation, and He is the prototype.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. All Things Created in Him,<br />
through Him, and unto Him</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:16 says, &ldquo;In Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;In Him&rdquo; means in the power of Christ&rsquo;s person. All things were created in the power of what Christ is. All creation bears the characteristics of Christ&rsquo;s intrinsic power. Furthermore, &ldquo;in Him&rdquo; implies that Christ is both the sphere and the element of creation. All things were created in Christ as the sphere and the element. &ldquo;Through Him&rdquo; indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was processed. Finally, &ldquo;unto Him&rdquo; indicates that Christ is the goal, the consummation, of all creation. All things were created unto Him for His possession. Therefore, the process of creation was carried out in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ.</p>
<p>In his note on Colossians 1:16 in his <em>New Translation,</em> J. N. Darby says that the words &ldquo;in Him&rdquo; mean in the power of Christ&rsquo;s person, and that &ldquo;He was the one whose intrinsic power characterized the creation.&rdquo; Commenting on the meaning of the Greek preposition used in the phrase &ldquo;in Him were all things created,&rdquo; Darby says that it is &ldquo;used generally for the character in which a thing is done&rdquo; (<em>Collected Writings,</em> Vol. 33, p. 87). He also states that the &ldquo;creation of all things was characterized and wrought by the inherent power which is in the Lord Jesus Christ, and all things subsist together as one ordered and law-governed whole by the same constant and inherent power&rdquo; (<em>Collected Writings,</em> Vol. 31, p. 188).</p>
<p>Christ is the active instrument through which creation was processed. In this process God&rsquo;s power is expressed, made manifest. This is revealed clearly in Romans 1:20, a verse which says that the &ldquo;invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, being apprehended by the things made, are clearly seen, both His eternal power and divinity.&rdquo; In all created things God&rsquo;s power is made manifest. Hence, in Darby&rsquo;s words, creation bears the characteristics of Christ&rsquo;s intrinsic power.</p>
<p>Christ is related to creation in a subjective way. He did not create the universe merely in an objective way as an objective Creator. He did not, so to speak, stand apart and call everything into being. On the contrary, the process of creation took place in Him, that is, in the power of His person. Christ is the unique power in the universe. His very person is this power. Therefore, creation was processed in Him. This means that He was not merely an objective Creator but also the subjective instrument through which creation was processed. For this reason creation bears the characteristics of Christ&rsquo;s intrinsic power.</p>
<p>The Bible says that all things came into being through Him, or were created in Him. The words &ldquo;through Him&rdquo; and &ldquo;in Him&rdquo; are subjective. According to the Greek, we may translate the last prepositional phrase in Colossians 1:16 either &ldquo;for Him&rdquo; or &ldquo;unto Him.&rdquo; It is better to render the Greek &ldquo;unto Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;For Him&rdquo; is objective, but &ldquo;unto Him&rdquo; is subjective. All things have been created in Christ, through Christ, and, ultimately, unto Christ. These expressions indicate that Christ has a subjective relationship to creation. Creation is not simply for Him; it is also unto Him. This means that it consummates in Him. The three prepositions in, through, and unto are used by the apostle to point out the subjective relationship of Christ to creation. Creation took place in the power of Christ&rsquo;s person, through Him as the active instrument, and unto Him as its consummation. Such a relationship is subjective. Because of His subjective relationship to creation, Christ expresses God in creation. Creation expresses the characteristics of Christ, who is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15).</p><h2 class="head2">6. Upholder of All Things<br />
by the Word of His Power</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:3 tells us that Christ upholds &ldquo;all things by the word of His power.&rdquo; After creating all things, Christ became the Upholder of all things. The earth is suspended in space. There is nothing visible supporting it. After Christ created the earth, He began to uphold it, and He upholds it now by the word of His power.</p>
<p>If you ask scientists what upholds the earth, they will say only that something upholds it. The earth is one of many planets. Astronomers tell us that all the planets move according to their own track. If they were to move out of orbit, there would be a global accident. Who upholds all the planets and the whole universe? Christ upholds all things, and He upholds them very easily. There is no need for Him to do anything&mdash;He simply speaks. He upholds all things by the word of His power.</p>
<p>The book of Hebrews emphasizes the word of God. Hebrews 11:3 says that the universe was framed by the word of God. Now we see in 1:3 that the universe is upheld by the word of Christ&rsquo;s power. The divine word is powerful. Christ is not only the Creator and the means of creation; He is also the Upholder. He created the universe, and now He upholds the universe by His word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. All Things Subsisting in Him</h2>
<p>Speaking of Christ, Colossians 1:17 says, &ldquo;All things subsist together in Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Subsist together in Him&rdquo; means to exist together by Christ as the holding center, just as the spokes of a wheel are held together by the hub at their center. For creation to subsist in Christ is a further indication that Christ is subjectively related to creation.</p>
<p>It is important to differentiate between the words exist, consist, and subsist. Colossians 1:17 does not say that all things exist in Christ or consist in Him; this verse says that all things subsist in Him. To exist is to be, to consist is to be composed or constituted, and to subsist is to be held together for existence. Imagine a wheel with its rim, spokes, and hub. All the spokes subsist together in the hub. The only way for the spokes to subsist is to be held together at the hub in the center of the wheel. This illustrates Christ&rsquo;s relationship to creation with respect to the fact that all things subsist in Him.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that all things came into being in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ. Nothing should be regarded as separate from Him. All things were made in the intrinsic power of Christ&rsquo;s person, through Him as the active instrument, and unto Him as the consummate goal. Furthermore, all things subsist, are held together, in Him as the hub. Because all things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ and because all things subsist in Christ, God can be expressed in creation through Christ, who is the image of the invisible God.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, the word &ldquo;subsist&rdquo; includes, or implies, three things: to exist, to live, and to live together. All things not only exist in Christ but also live, or continue in existence, in Him. Furthermore, all things live together, or exist together, in Him. The entire universe subsists, exists together, in Christ. He is the center in which all things subsist. All things not only exist in Him; all things also live in Him and live together corporately in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">8. The Heir of All Things</h2>
<p>In creation Christ is the Heir of all things. Hebrews 1:2 says that God has appointed Christ the Son Heir of all things. In the past Christ was the Creator, in the present He is the Upholder of all things, and in the future He will be the Heir to inherit all things. The sun, the earth, the solar system, the stars, the galaxies&mdash;all are His. All things are for Him, and He will inherit all things. In God&rsquo;s creation Christ is the Creator, the Upholder, and the Heir. All things are of Him, through Him, and unto Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(6)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall consider Christ&rsquo;s person in incarnation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">D. IN INCARNATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. God Manifested in the Flesh</h2>
<p>In the incarnation Christ is God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16). He was manifested in the flesh not only as the Son but as the entire God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. As the Word, who is the very God, Christ became flesh (John 1:14). Therefore, He is God&mdash;the Triune God&mdash; manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>It is important for us to realize that it was the entire God and not only the Son of God who was incarnated. John 1:14 says that the Word, which is God, became flesh. This God, who the Word is, is not a partial God; rather, He is the entire God&mdash;God the Son, God the Father, and God the Spirit. The New Testament does not say that the Word, who became flesh, was God the Son. Instead, the New Testament indicates that in the beginning was the Word, and this Word is the entire Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Hence, Christ in incarnation is the entire God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>Because of the influence of traditional teaching, we may think that only the Son of God, not the entire God, was incarnated. Actually, the New Testament does not say that the Son of God was incarnated; it says that God was manifested in the flesh. This means that the entire God became incarnated.</p>
<p>Through incarnation and human living God was manifested in the flesh. &ldquo;In the flesh&rdquo; means in the likeness, in the fashion, of man (Rom. 8:3; Phil. 2:7-8). In the form of man Christ appeared to people (2 Cor. 5:16), yet He was God manifested in a man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The God-Man</h2>
<h2 class="head3">a. Conceived of the Holy Spirit,<br />
Having the Essence of God</h2>
<p>Christ is the God-man. As the God-man, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:20). The Gospel of Luke is unique in telling us how the God-man was conceived. He was conceived not of a man but of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence. The Holy Spirit is God Himself reaching man. In the conceiving of the God-man, the Holy Spirit came into humanity.</p>
<p>Because the God-man was conceived of the Holy Spirit, He has the divine essence, the essence of God. Here we use the word &ldquo;essence&rdquo; in a strong sense to denote something even more intrinsic than nature. The essence is the intrinsic constituent of a certain substance. The God-man was conceived of the Holy Spirit not only with the divine nature but with the divine essence.</p>
<p>Concerning the conceiving of the God-man, Luke 1:35 says, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; wherefore also the holy thing which is born will be called, Son of God.&rdquo; As the cloud overshadowed the Mount of Transfiguration (Matt. 17:5) and the tabernacle (Exo. 40:34, 38), the power of the Most High overshadowed Mary. It seems that, according to this verse, the Holy Spirit only came upon Mary as the power for her to conceive the Lord Jesus. However, Matthew 1:18 and 20 tell us that Mary &ldquo;was found having in womb out of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (lit.), and &ldquo;the thing begotten [generated] in her is out of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (lit.). This indicates that the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit had been generated in Mary&rsquo;s womb before she delivered the Lord Jesus.</p><h2 class="head3">b. Born of a Human Virgin,<br />
Having the Essence of Man</h2>
<p>As the God-man, Christ was born of a human virgin and therefore has the essence of man (Luke 1:31; Gal. 4:4). Christ was born of a human virgin with the human essence. In Luke 1:27 and 31 we see that a virgin named Mary conceived in her womb and bore a son whose name was Jesus.</p>
<p>Because the God-man was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence and was born of a human virgin with the human essence, He has two essences, the divine and the human. Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin, accomplished with both the divine and the human essences, constitutes a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, producing the God-man, the One who is both the complete God and a perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctively, without a third nature being produced. This is the most wonderful and excellent person of Christ in His incarnation.</p>
<p>The conception of the God-man was God&rsquo;s incarnation, constituted not only by the divine power but also of the divine essence added to the human essence, hence producing the God-man of two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity. Through this, God joined Himself to humanity so that He might be manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>Some Bible teachers have failed to understand the matter of mingling in Christ&rsquo;s conception. In ancient times there was a debate regarding the word &ldquo;mingling,&rdquo; a debate concerning the mingling of the divine essence and the human essence in the person of the Lord Jesus. Some who did not understand this mingling said that it caused a third nature to be produced, something which is neither divine nor human. It is a great heresy to say that Jesus Christ is not quite God nor quite man but a third entity with a third nature, something neither God nor man. To say that with respect to the Lord Jesus the mingling of the divine essence with the human essence produced a third nature, a nature that is neither fully human nor fully divine, is heretical. The first definition of the word mingle given in <em>Webster&rsquo;s Abridged Dictionary</em> is: &ldquo;to combine or join (one thing with another, or two or more things together), especially so that the original elements are distinguishable in the combination.&rdquo; According to this definition, when two or more things are mingled together, their original natures are not lost but remain distinguishable. This certainly is the situation regarding Christ as the God-man. He was conceived of two essences, the divine and the human. Hence, He is a mingling of God and man. But in Him both the divine essence and the human essence remain and are distinguishable. These essences are mingled in Him as one person without the producing of a third nature. As the God-man He possesses two natures, and in Him each nature is distinguishable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. The Holy Thing</h2>
<p>In Luke 1:35 Christ is called &ldquo;the holy thing.&rdquo; Because the conceiving was of the Holy Spirit, what was born of this conception was a holy thing, something intrinsically holy. As the holy thing, Christ was absolutely for God and separated unto God. He was absolutely unto God and one with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. Jesus</h2>
<p>The name Jesus was given by God. The angel Gabriel told Mary that the child she would conceive was to be called Jesus (Luke 1:31). Later, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph and also told him to call the child Jesus (Matt. 1:21). Hence, &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; was a God-given name.</p>
<p>Luke 1:31 says, &ldquo;Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus.&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua (Num. 13:16), which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah. Therefore, Jesus is not only a man but also Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. Jehovah</h2>
<p>The name Jesus includes the name Jehovah. In Hebrew &ldquo;God&rdquo; means the mighty One, and &ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo; means I Am (Exo. 3:14). The verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; in Hebrew refers not only to the present but also includes the past and the future. Hence, the correct meaning of Jehovah is I Am That I Am, the One who is now in the present, who was in the past, and who will be in the future and in eternity forever. This is Jehovah.</p>
<p>Only God is the eternal One. From eternity past to eternity future, He is the I Am. Because the Lord Jesus is God incarnate, He could say of Himself, &ldquo;Before Abraham came into being, I am&rdquo; (John 8:58). Furthermore, He could say to the Jews, &ldquo;Unless you believe that I am, you shall die in your sins,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am&rdquo; (John 8:24, 28). We need to realize that Jesus is the I Am and believe in Him as the I Am. The Lord Jesus is whatever we need. If we need salvation, He Himself will be salvation to us. Whatever we need, He is. He is life, light, power, wisdom, righteousness, holiness. Everything we need is found in Him.</p><h2 class="head3">b. The Savior, or the Salvation</h2>
<p>We have pointed out that the name Jesus means Jehovah the Savior, or Jehovah our salvation. Jesus is Jehovah-Savior, the One who saves us from everything God condemns and from all negative things. He saves us from our sin and sins, from all the besetting sins in our daily life, from the evil power of Satan, and from every bondage and addiction.</p>
<p>Jesus is not only the Savior&mdash;He Himself is also our salvation. He does not simply give us salvation; He comes to us as our salvation.</p>
<p>When we call upon Him to save us, He is our salvation. When we call on Jesus we are not simply calling the name of a man. Jesus is not simply a man&mdash;He is Jehovah our Savior, Jehovah our salvation. When we call on the name of Jesus, we are calling on Jehovah as our Savior and as our salvation. Whoever calls on the name of Jesus will be saved.</p>
<p>Jesus is also the real Joshua. Moses brought God&rsquo;s people out of Egypt, but Joshua brought them into rest. As our Joshua, Jesus brings us into rest. Matthew 11:28 and 29 indicate that Jesus is rest and that He brings us into Himself as rest. Hebrews 4:8, 9, and 11 also speak of Jesus as the real Joshua who brings us into the rest of the good land. He is not only our Savior saving us from sin; He is our Joshua bringing us into rest, which is Himself as the good land. Whenever we call on His name, He saves us and brings us into the enjoyment of Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. Emmanuel</h2>
<p>In His incarnation Christ is also Emmanuel: &ldquo;Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us&rdquo; (Matt. 1:23). Jesus was the name given by God, while Emmanuel, meaning God with us, was the name called by man. Jesus the Savior is God with us. God is He, and He is God incarnated to dwell among us (John 1:14). He is not only God but God with us. Without Him we cannot meet God, for He is God. Without Him we cannot find God, for He is God incarnate.</p>
<p>Christ is Emmanuel, God with us. &ldquo;Us&rdquo; refers to the saved ones, the believers. Day by day we have Christ as Emmanuel. Whenever we have some experience of the Lord Jesus, we shall realize that He is God with us. God said that His name would be called Jesus. But as we receive Him and experience Him, we realize that Jesus is Emmanuel, God with us.</p>
<p>When we call on Jesus, we have the sense that God is with us. We call on the Lord Jesus and we find God. Jesus is not only the Son of God but also God Himself. When we call on Jesus, we have Jehovah, we have the Savior, we have salvation, and we have God with us.</p>
<p>The more we experience the Lord Jesus, the more we shall know that He is Emmanuel, God with us. As we experience Him, we may say, &ldquo;This is God! This is not God far away from me, or God in the heavens, but God with me.&rdquo; In our experience Jesus truly is Emmanuel.</p>
<p>According to Matthew 18:20, whenever we are gathered together into the name of Jesus, He is with us. This is Emmanuel, God with us. The presence of Jesus in our gatherings is actually God with us.</p>
<p>At the end of Matthew 28:20 the Lord says, &ldquo;Behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.&rdquo; Here the Lord promises to be with us in His resurrection with all authority all the days until the consummation of the age, that is, until the end of this age. &ldquo;All the days&rdquo; includes today. The Lord Jesus as Emmanuel is with us now, today!</p>
<p>Today Christ is not only among us; He is in our spirit. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; This One who is with our spirit is Emmanuel, God with us.</p>
<p>Today the Lord&rsquo;s presence is the Spirit. We cannot separate the Spirit from the presence of Jesus. The Spirit is simply the reality of the Lord&rsquo;s presence (John 14:16-20). This presence is Emmanuel, God with us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. The Son of Man</h2>
<p>In His incarnation Christ is the Son of Man (Matt. 16:13). Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit, He is the Son of God. Because He was also conceived in and born of the human virgin, He is the Son of Man. On the divine side, He is the Son of God; on the human side, He is the Son of Man. Because the Lord Jesus is both the Son of God and the Son of Man, sometimes He indicated to others that He is the Son of God (John 5:25; 9:35, 37; 10:36), and at other times, that He is the Son of Man (John 1:51; 3:14; 5:27).</p>
<p>In His incarnation Christ emptied Himself by putting aside the form, the outward expression, of His deity and becoming in the likeness of men. He was God with the expression of God. Although He was equal with God, He put aside this equality and emptied Himself by taking the likeness of men. He became a man through incarnation. He did not regard His equality with God as a thing to grasp. Rather, He laid aside this equality and emptied Himself. This does not mean, however, that Christ in His human living was no longer God. It simply means that He put aside His outward expression of God. Although He subsisted in the form of God, He became in the likeness of men and in the fashion of a man. As a result, He had the appearance of a man instead of the expression of God.</p>
<p>To accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose and to establish the kingdom of the heavens, it was necessary for Christ to be a man. Without man, God&rsquo;s purpose cannot be carried out on earth, and the kingdom of the heavens cannot be constituted on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. The Second Man</h2>
<p>Christ in His incarnation is also the second Man (1 Cor. 15:47). Through the incarnation of Christ, God in the Son became a man. God had created man with a purpose according to His design, but man failed Him in His purpose and ruined His design. Instead of creating another man, God Himself came to be the second Man. God came to be the second Man not in the Father nor in the Spirit but in the Son.</p>
<p>Concerning Christ as the second Man, 1 Corinthians 15:47 says, &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second Man is out of heaven.&rdquo; &ldquo;Out of the earth&rdquo; denotes the first man Adam&rsquo;s origin, and &ldquo;earthy&rdquo; denotes His nature. As the first man, Adam is the head of the old creation, representing it in creation. As the second Man, Christ is the head of the new creation, representing it in resurrection. In the entire universe there are two men: the first man Adam, including all his descendants, and the second Man Christ, comprising all His believers. We believers were included in the first man by birth and became part of the second Man by regeneration. Our believing has transferred us out of the first man and into the second. As a part of the first man, our origin is the earth and our nature is earthy. As part of the second man, our origin is God and our nature is heavenly. &ldquo;Out of heaven&rdquo; denotes both the second Man Christ&rsquo;s divine origin and His heavenly nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">8. The Last Adam</h2>
<p>In the incarnation Christ is not only the second Man but also the last Adam. Concerning Christ as the last Adam, 1 Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; This verse implies both the old creation and the new creation. Adam, the first man, was the head of the old creation. When God created him, Adam became a living soul. This means that he became a person, a human being. In Hebrew the word for Adam means man. Christ being the last Adam implies a termination and conclusion of the old creation. The old creation ends with a man, the last Adam. This Man who terminated the old creation became in resurrection a life-giving Spirit. Now this Spirit is the center and lifeline of the new creation. The old creation was created by God. The new creation, however, comes into being not by creation but by resurrection. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 15:45 implies two creations: the old creation with man as a living soul to be its center, and the new creation in resurrection with the life-giving Spirit as its center. Through incarnation Christ became the last Adam to die on the cross for the termination of the old creation, and through resurrection He as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit to germinate the new creation.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(7)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover Christ&rsquo;s person in His human living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">E. IN HUMAN LIVING</h2>
<p>The foregoing messages on Christ&rsquo;s person have been mainly concerned with His person in the divine element. Now we need to see His person in the human element. No doubt, this aspect of Christ is also for God&rsquo;s dispensing. In order for God to dispense Himself into our being, it was necessary for Him to become a man. Before God could dispense Himself into us, He first had to dispense Himself into the man Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that in His incarnation Christ was conceived of the Spirit of God and was born of a human virgin. Because of this conception and birth, He has both the divine essence and the human essence. Therefore, when Christ became a man, He was the God-man possessing the divine essence and the human essence. Now we need to consider Him, the God-man, in His human living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Son of Man, Found in Fashion as a Man</h2>
<p>In human living Christ was the Son of Man found in fashion as a man. He was not only the Son of Man; He was found in the fashion of a man, for He lived as a man. In Matthew 8:20 the Lord refers to Himself as the Son of Man: &ldquo;The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere that He may lay His head.&rdquo; In His living the Lord Jesus continually lived in fashion as a man. Hence, Philippians 2:8 says that, in His human living He was &ldquo;found in fashion as a man.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;fashion&rdquo; denotes the outward guise, the semblance. This is a specific repetition of &ldquo;likeness&rdquo; in Philippians 2:7. What Christ looked like in His humanity was found by men to be in fashion as a man. Being found in fashion as a man, in the appearance of a man, He humbled Himself. This means that when He was a man, He did not insist on anything. Rather, He humbled Himself to the point of dying on the cross. First, having the form of God, He emptied Himself. Then, being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death (Phil. 2:7-8).</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. A Despised Nazarene</h2>
<p>In His human living Christ was also a despised Nazarene (John 1:45-46). Mary conceived a child in Nazareth (Luke 1:26-27, 31). According to the prophecy in Micah 5:2, however, Christ had to be born in Bethlehem. Under God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement, Caesar Augustus ordered a census (Luke 2:1-7, and this forced all the people to return to their places. Mary and Joseph were forced to return to Bethlehem, their home town. Immediately after they arrived in Bethlehem, Jesus was born. Eventually, a mistake made by the Magi aroused the hatred and jealousy of King Herod, who was angered that a kingly child had been born. Then Joseph received guidance in a dream to take the child to Egypt (Matt. 2:13-15). This enabled God to fulfill the prophecy of Hosea 11:1. After Herod died, Joseph received word in another dream to return to the Holy Land (Matt. 2:19-20). When Joseph returned and learned that Archelaus, the son of Herod, was in power, he was afraid to remain in the territory around Bethlehem. Therefore, he went to Nazareth, where Jesus was raised (Matt. 2:21-23). For this reason Jesus was called Jesus the Nazarene (Matt. 26:71; Mark 10:47).</p>
<p>When Jesus Christ was born into the human race, He appeared in a way that was somewhat hidden, in a way that was not open or evident. He was called Jesus of Nazareth, for He was a Nazarene. When Philip met Jesus, he realized that Jesus was the Messiah. Then Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth. Immediately Nathanael said, &ldquo;Can anything good come out of Nazareth?&rdquo; (John 1:45-46). Did Philip give Nathanael the wrong information? It is difficult to say. Philip only knew that Jesus was the son of Joseph and that He was a Nazarene. Although Jesus was from Nazareth and was a Nazarene, He had not been born in Nazareth but in Bethlehem. Nathanael was troubled. However, Philip did not argue with him; he simply said, &ldquo;Come and see&rdquo; (John 1:46).</p>
<p>Christ, the seed of David, was born in Bethlehem, but He appeared as a Nazarene from Galilee (John 7:52), a town that was despised by the people of that time. Because the Lord was raised in Nazareth, others did not consider Him as one born in Bethlehem. On one occasion Nicodemus, who had come to know Jesus, tried to argue with the Pharisees concerning Him. The Pharisees asked him, &ldquo;Are you also from Galilee?&rdquo; (John 7:52). Galilee was a Gentile region; the Bible speaks of &ldquo;Galilee of the nations&rdquo; (Matt. 4:15). The Pharisees seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, &ldquo;Are you from Galilee? We know that Jesus came out of Galilee. But out of Galilee there comes no prophet.&rdquo; Apparently, Jesus was from Galilee, from Nazareth; actually, He was born in Bethlehem according to His hidden and secret way of appearing. As a Nazarene, the Lord grew up as a &ldquo;root out of a dry ground,&rdquo; having &ldquo;no form nor comeliness,&rdquo; &ldquo;no beauty that we should desire him,&rdquo; for He was &ldquo;despised and rejected of men&rdquo; (Isa. 53:2-3). For this reason, we should not know Him according to the flesh (2 Cor. 5:16) but according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>As a despised Nazarene, the Lord Jesus was not a man outwardly in a high position; rather He was low, not in standard, morality, or virtues but in rank and position. When He became a man, He took the lowest position and rank. Hence, He was despised as a Nazarene.</p>
<p>Galilee was a despised province, and the Galileans were a despised people. If you consult a map, you will see that Samaria was between Judea and Galilee. Of these three provinces, Judea was held in high regard. Samaria was despised because the people there were of mixed blood. Although the Galileans were not of mixed blood, Galilee was still considered an inferior region. All the people in that region, especially those in the city of Nazareth, were despised. As we have pointed out, although Christ was born in Bethlehem, the royal city of David, He grew up in Nazareth and as a result became known as a Nazarene.</p>
<p>Matthew 2:23 says, &ldquo;And came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene.&rdquo; The &ldquo;prophets,&rdquo; in plural, indicates that this is not a particular prophecy, but a summary of the significance of several prophecies, such as Psalm 22:6-7. The title &ldquo;Nazarene&rdquo; may refer to the &ldquo;Branch&rdquo; in Isaiah 11:1, which in Hebrew is <em>netzer.</em> The Branch there, signifying Christ, is &ldquo;a shoot [or sprout] of the stump of Jesse,&rdquo; the father of David. By the time Jesus was born, the throne of David had been overthrown. This means that the royal stem of David had been cut off. Then a new shoot sprouted from the stump of Jesse and grew out of his roots. The sprouting and growing of this shoot was in a situation of humiliation. Jesus was not born in a recognized and honored royal home, and He did not grow up in a renowned city like Jerusalem. He was born to a poor home and grew up in a despised town. All this made Him a Nazarene, not a lofty branch of a stately tree but a seemingly insignificant shoot from the stump of Jesse.</p>
<p>Although Jesus was a Nazarene, within Him there was the glory of God. Therefore, we should not know Christ according to the outward appearance. Rather, we need to discern the inward reality of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">3. A Carpenter, a Son of a Carpenter</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was a carpenter, a son of a carpenter (Mark 6:3; Matt. 13:55). Although the Lord was a descendant of the royal family of David, He was the son of a carpenter. This indicates that the royal family had gone down from a high rank to a low rank, to the rank of a carpenter. The Lord Jesus was the Son of Man, a despised Nazarene, and a carpenter, the son of a carpenter.</p>
<p>Only in the Gospel of Mark is the Lord Jesus called a carpenter. Those who rejected Him asked, &ldquo;Is not this the carpenter?&rdquo; They used the word &ldquo;carpenter&rdquo; in a despising manner. They were astounded by His teaching, by His wisdom, and by His works of power, but they regarded Him as a person of low status. In today&rsquo;s terms, they might have wondered what qualifications He had or what kind of degree He had.</p>
<p>Mark 6:3 says that those who rejected the Lord Jesus, regarding Him merely as a carpenter, were &ldquo;stumbled in Him.&rdquo; Why were they stumbled in Him? They were stumbled in Him because, on the one hand, they heard wonderful things out of His mouth and saw some of His marvelous deeds, and yet, on the other hand, they considered that He did not have a high status or degree. They saw Him as one who was merely a carpenter. Therefore, they were stumbled in Him, and they despised Him.</p>
<p>In Mark 6 we see the Lord Jesus as a carpenter. He did not have a high social status. But He certainly had the riches of the Triune God, and He also knew the depths of the truth in the Scriptures. His hearers were greatly surprised at His knowledge of the Bible.</p>
<p>The record in Mark 6 should cause us to ask ourselves what we want and what we value. Do we want an advanced degree or a high social status? In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we want Jesus, and we want the riches of Christ. Instead of the mere superficial doctrines in the Bible, we want the depths of the divine truths in the Word of God. We would like to follow the Lord Jesus in ministering the riches of the Triune God to others and in presenting to them the depths of the divine truth in the Scriptures. However, we should not think that if we have the riches of Christ and the depths of the truth, we shall be welcomed. No, this is not the age when the Lord&rsquo;s truth is welcomed on earth. On the contrary, this is an age when the Lord and His disciples are despised and rejected.</p>
<p>No one can compare with the Lord Jesus. He had the riches of the Triune God, and He had the depths of the truth. No matter how rich He was or how much He knew the truth in the Holy Scriptures, He was despised and rejected instead of welcomed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. Taking the Form of a Slave<br />
Serving God and Men</h2>
<p>In His human living Christ took the form of a slave, serving God and men (Phil. 2:7; Acts 3:13; Mark 10:45). He was a slave not only to God but also to man. In New Testament usage, the word &ldquo;slave&rdquo; refers to one who has sold himself and has lost all human rights. When the Lord Jesus was on earth as a man, He was such a person. He was a slave who had no rights.</p>
<p>Speaking of Christ, Philippians 2:7 says that He &ldquo;emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;form&rdquo; in this verse is the same word used for the form of God in Philippians 2:6. In His incarnation the Lord did not alter His divine nature but only His outward expression of the form of God to that of a slave. This was not a change of essence but of appearance.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Mark presents the Lord Jesus as the Slave of God. Because Mark presents Christ as a slave, he does not tell us His genealogy and status, for the ancestry of a slave is not worthy of note. Neither does Mark intend to impress us with the Slave&rsquo;s wonderful words (as Matthew does with His marvelous teachings and parables concerning the heavenly kingdom, and John with his profound revelations of divine truths), but with His deeds in His gospel service. Concerning this, the Gospel of Mark provides more details than the other Gospels in order to portray Christ&rsquo;s diligence, faithfulness, and other virtues in the saving service He rendered to sinners for God. In Mark&rsquo;s Gospel is the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Christ as the Slave of Jehovah in Isaiah 42:1-4, 6-7; 49:5-7; 50:4-7; 52:13&mdash;53:12 and the details of the teaching regarding Christ as the Slave of God in Philippians 2:5-11. Such a Slave served sinners as their Savior with His life as their ransom (Mark 10:45), for the fulfillment of the eternal purpose of God, whose Slave He was.</p>
<p>In Mark 10:45 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.&rdquo; This is a very strong expression stating that Christ, as the Son of Man in His humanity, is the Slave of God to serve sinners even with His life, His soul. Furthermore, the word &ldquo;ransom&rdquo; here indicates that even the Lord&rsquo;s redemption was His service rendered to sinners for God&rsquo;s plan.</p><h2 class="head2">5. A Faithful Witness of God</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:5 Christ is called the faithful Witness. As the faithful Witness Christ testifies God. Without Him, we cannot know God or gain God. He lived a life as a witness to God. Although He was a despised Nazarene and even a slave, His living was a testimony of God, for He was a living witness of God. This means that He lived God. As a despised man in a low estate, He lived God. He lived a life that witnessed God faithfully.</p>
<p>In Revelation 3:14 the Lord indicates that He is the Amen, the faithful and true Witness. In Greek &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; means firm, steadfast, trustworthy. The Lord Jesus is the firm, steadfast, and trustworthy One. Because He is firm, steadfast, and trustworthy, He is the faithful and true Witness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. The Holy and Righteous One</h2>
<p>In his speaking in Acts 3:14 Peter calls the Lord Jesus &ldquo;the Holy and Righteous One.&rdquo; What does it mean to say that the Lord is the Holy One? In this verse &ldquo;Holy&rdquo; indicates that Jesus the Nazarene, the One despised by the Jewish leaders, was absolutely for God and separated unto Him. Furthermore, He was absolutely one with God. According to the denotation of the word holy in the Bible, it signifies one who is absolutely unto God, who is absolutely for God, and who is absolutely one with God. In all of human history only the Lord Jesus is such a one. Throughout His entire life He was absolutely separated unto God, for God, and one with God. There never was an instant when He was not absolutely for God and one with Him. Therefore, He is called the Holy One. He alone deserves this title.</p>
<p>As the Holy One, the human living of the Lord Jesus was altogether holy in nature. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20), and He was called &ldquo;the holy thing&rdquo; (Luke 1:35). In His being and behavior He was holy. His living, which was absolutely separated unto God, for God, and one with God, corresponded to God&rsquo;s desire and nature.</p>
<p>In Acts 3:14, Peter called the Lord Jesus not only the Holy One but also the Righteous One. To be righteous is to be right with God and also with everyone and everything. Only the Lord Jesus can be called the Righteous One because only He is right with God and with everyone and everything. In everything the Lord said and did He was right with both God and man. As the Righteous One, the Lord Jesus is the Right One. He was never wrong with God or with anyone or anything. In His human living the Lord was always the Holy One, the One absolutely separated unto God, for God, and one with God, and also the Righteous One, the One who was right with God, with everyone, and with everything.</p>
<p>In this message we have covered six aspects of Christ in His human living: the Son of Man found in fashion as a man, a despised Nazarene, a carpenter who was a son of a carpenter, the One who took the form of a slave to serve God and man, the faithful Witness of God, and the Holy and Righteous One. As such a One Christ is being dispensed into us, the members of His Body. If we are under His dispensing, surely we shall be the kind of person He was in His human living. We shall not want to hold a high rank but rather be low in rank and position. Actually, we are not the ones living in this way. This is Christ living in us after being dispensed into us. This is not a matter of following His steps or imitating Him. This is a matter of having Christ dispensed into us and then living Him. First, Christ is dispensed into our being, and then He lives from within us. Of course, as He lives within us we shall have a human living that is low in position and rank, yet holy in nature and righteous in behavior.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(8)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover the six aspects of Christ in redemption: the Lamb of God (John 1:29), a man in the flesh (Rom. 8:3), the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45), a creature (Col. 1:15), a serpent in form (John 3:14), and our peace and Peacemaker (Eph. 2:14-16).</p>
<h2 class="head1">F. IN REDEMPTION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Lamb of God</h2>
<p>In John 1:29 we see that in redemption Christ is the Lamb of God: &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; This verse indicates that Christ as the Lamb of God takes away sin from the human race. The phrase &ldquo;of the world&rdquo; in this verse actually means from mankind. Through Satan sin entered into man, for Satan injected sin, his poisonous nature, into the human race. But the Lamb of God has come to take away this sin from the world, from mankind.</p>
<p>Christ died on the cross as the Lamb of God to deal with sin and sins. From 1 Corinthians 15:3, 1 Peter 2:24, and Hebrews 9:28 we see that as the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus died for our sins. Furthermore, according to 2 Corinthians 5:21 and Hebrews 9:26, His death dealt with sin. Therefore, both sin and sins were dealt with by the Lamb of God, who was under God&rsquo;s judgment on the cross.</p>
<p>In redemption Christ as the Lamb of God satisfied God&rsquo;s requirements, the requirements of His righteousness, holiness, and glory. No fallen human being could ever fulfill these requirements. Hence, there was the need of a Redeemer, the Lamb of God, designated by God to fulfill His righteous, holy, and glorious requirements.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John the Lamb of God signifies the Word in the flesh (John 1:1, 14) as the fulfillment of all the Old Testament offerings to accomplish God&rsquo;s full redemption. Christ is the totality of all the offerings. He is not only the sin offering but also the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the wave offering, the heave offering, the free-will offering, and the drink offering. With Christ as all the offerings we have God&rsquo;s full redemption. Through Christ as the Lamb of God fulfilling all the offerings we may enter into God and participate in the divine life and nature (John 3:14-15; 2 Pet. 1:4). Because of Christ as the Lamb of God, we are well able, even enabled, to enter into God. We may boldly come into God, knowing that He does not have the right to reject us, because we come through His Lamb. We have full redemption in Christ, and therefore we are enabled to enter into God to enjoy all that He is.</p>
<p>According to 1 Peter 1:20, Christ as the redeeming Lamb was foreknown by God before the foundation of the world, that is, before the creation of the universe: &ldquo;Who was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in the last times for your sake.&rdquo; Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be His redeeming Lamb according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world. This was done according to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and plan; it did not happen accidentally.</p>
<p>The Greek root for the word &ldquo;foreknown&rdquo; includes the meaning of appreciation, approval, and possession. And to be foreknown by God means to be foreordained by God. In his expanded translation of the New Testament Kenneth S. Wuest uses the word &ldquo;foreordained&rdquo; in 1 Peter 1:20, saying, &ldquo;Christ...was foreordained before the foundation of the universe was laid.&rdquo; This means that in eternity past God approved Christ and appreciated Him. God also ordained Christ to be His anointed One, the One commissioned to fulfill in time all that had been planned by God for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose. In particular, Christ was foreknown, foreordained, to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption.</p>
<p>Revelation 13:8 speaks of Christ as &ldquo;the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.&rdquo; In the eternal view of God, Christ as the Lamb of God was slain from the time creation came into being. This means that in the sight of God Christ was slain not two thousand years ago, but from the time creation came into existence, that is, since the fall of man as a part of the world. God foreknew the fall of creation. Therefore, from the existence of creation Christ, the Lamb of God, was slain.</p><h2 class="head2">2. A Man in the Flesh</h2>
<p>When Christ died on the cross, He also died as a man in the flesh. As the Word which was with God and which is God, He became flesh (John 1:1, 14). First Peter 3:18 says that Christ was &ldquo;put to death in flesh.&rdquo; As a man in the flesh, Christ had only the likeness, the form, of a fallen man; He did not have the sinful nature of a fallen man. This means that He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3), but He did not have the actual nature of sin. Because the Lord Jesus died as a man in the flesh, His death dealt with the fallen flesh. Sin and the fallen flesh were all dealt with by the death of Christ.</p>
<p>Romans 8:3 reveals that when Christ died as a man in the flesh, God condemned sin in the flesh. The phrase &ldquo;sin in the flesh&rdquo; refers to the source of sin, the Devil. For this reason, in Romans 6, 7, and 8 sin is personified as a living one. This living sin was condemned by God when Christ died on the cross as a man in the likeness of the flesh of sin. When the flesh that Christ put on through incarnation was crucified, God condemned the sin in the flesh of fallen mankind.</p>
<p>Christ was sent only in the likeness of the flesh of sin. He did not actually have the flesh of sin, but only the form, the likeness, of the flesh of sin. This is portrayed by the type of the brass serpent: the brass serpent had the form of a serpent, but it did not have the poisonous nature of a serpent. Likewise, when Christ died on the cross, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not have the nature of the flesh of sin. Nevertheless, because He died as a man in the flesh, God could condemn sin in the flesh. As a man in the flesh He died so that sin in the flesh might be condemned by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. The Last Adam&mdash;the Man in the Old Creation</h2>
<p>In redemption Christ was also the last Adam, a man in the old creation (1 Cor. 15:45b). This is the reason Romans 6:6 says that our old man was crucified with Him. Because the Lord died on the cross as a man, the last Adam, in the old creation, our old man was dealt with through His death.</p>
<p>As the last Adam, Christ was the conclusion of the old man. Therefore, when He was crucified, our old man was crucified with Him. His death as the last Adam was for God&rsquo;s dealing with our old man.</p>
<p>When Christ was incarnated, He took us upon Himself. He put on blood and flesh. Therefore, when He was crucified, we were crucified with Him (Gal. 2:20). From God&rsquo;s viewpoint, before we were born we were crucified in Christ. When Christ was crucified, not only were sins and sin dealt with; we ourselves were crucified with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. A Creature</h2>
<p>When Christ died on the cross for our redemption, He died not only as a man in the flesh, the last Adam, but also as a creature. Christ is both the Creator and a creature, for as God He is the Creator and as a man He is a creature. Christ with respect to His humanity is a creature. Christ is a man, a typical man with flesh and blood, which are created things. It is ridiculous to say that Christ is a man but deny that regarding His humanity He is a creature.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:15 reveals that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. For Christ to be the Firstborn of all creation means that He is the first of all the creatures. The preposition &ldquo;of&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation&rdquo; indicates that Christ is one of the creatures, not someone who is apart from the creatures. As the Firstborn, He is one of the many items of the creatures.</p>
<p>The redemption accomplished by Christ is not only for man but also for all creation. Through His redemption all created things in heaven and on earth have been reconciled to God (Col. 1:20). Thus, Christ&rsquo;s redemption is for all things. Hebrews 2:9 says clearly that Christ tasted death not only on behalf of every man but also on behalf of everything.</p>
<p>If Christ were only a man and not the Firstborn of all creation, the first of all the creatures, how could He have accomplished redemption for all the creatures? In the same way that it was necessary for Him to be a man to accomplish redemption for man, it was necessary for Him to be a creature to accomplish redemption for all the creatures. It was necessary for Christ to be the first of all creation in order for Him to redeem all creation, just as it was necessary for Him to be the last Adam in order to be qualified to be the Redeemer of mankind. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He died also as the Firstborn of all creation. Hence, through His death on the cross the entire old creation was dealt with.</p>
<p>The fact that Christ&rsquo;s death as a creature terminated the entire old creation is indicated by the rending of the veil in the temple from top to bottom. Concerning this, Luke 23:44 and 45 say, &ldquo;It was already about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour, the sun&rsquo;s light failing; and the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.&rdquo; The darkness here is related to sin, and the veil is a type of the flesh of the Lord Jesus. Hebrews 10:20 speaks of &ldquo;a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; On the veil that was rent when Christ died cherubim were embroidered (Exo. 26:31). According to Ezekiel 1:5, 10 and 10:14-15, cherubim were living creatures. The cherubim on the veil, then, represent the living creatures. Upon the humanity of Christ were all the creatures. This means that in His flesh Christ bore all the creatures. When the veil in the temple was torn, the cherubim embroidered on it were also torn. This indicates that when the flesh of Christ was crucified, all the creatures borne by Him were crucified as well. Through the death of Christ, sin, sins, the flesh, the old man, and all the creatures were dealt with. His death truly was all-inclusive.</p><h2 class="head2">5. A Serpent in Form</h2>
<p>Some may be very surprised to hear that Christ died on the cross even as a serpent in form. &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:14-15). Here the Lord Jesus applies to Himself the type of the brass serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness (Num. 21:4-9). Because the children of Israel complained and were rebellious, &ldquo;the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died&rdquo; (Num. 21:6). Then the people came to Moses and confessed that they had sinned in speaking against the Lord and against him. They asked Moses to pray that the Lord would take away the serpents. When Moses prayed for the people, the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live&rdquo; (v. 8). We are told that Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole. Then &ldquo;it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived&rdquo; (v. 9).</p>
<p>The incident in Numbers 21 was sovereignly prepared by God to reveal a particular type of Christ. The brass serpent lifted up on a pole is a type of Christ lifted up on the cross for us as a serpent in form according to John 3:14. As fallen human beings, we all have been &ldquo;bitten&rdquo; by the serpent, the Devil. We were bitten in the garden of Eden when Adam was bitten by the serpent and poisoned by him. Therefore, we are all serpentine beings with the poison of the serpent in our nature. In the sight of God, the entire fallen human race consists of poisonous serpents. As such serpents we needed a substitute; we needed Christ to die for us in the form of a serpent, but without the poisonous element of the serpent.</p>
<p>We need to be very clear that Christ was a serpent in form but that He did not have the poisonous nature of a serpent. We, however, actually are serpentine, for in our fallen nature we are children of the old serpent, the Devil (1 John 3:10). For this reason, in Matthew 12:34 the Lord Jesus called the Pharisees a &ldquo;brood of vipers.&rdquo; In Matthew 23:33 He called them &ldquo;serpents, brood of vipers,&rdquo; the offspring of the most poisonous kind of serpents. Because the Devil is the father of sinners (John 8:44), sinners are children of the Devil. Sinners also are serpents, the offspring of vipers. Therefore, in the sight of God, in our fallen nature we are not only sinful&mdash;we are serpentine.</p>
<p>The serpent is a symbol of the Devil, who is called &ldquo;the ancient serpent&rdquo; (Rev. 12:9). No doubt, the Lord Jesus was crucified as a serpent in form in order to deal with Satan, the Devil, the old serpent.</p>
<p>It was through being crucified as a serpent in form that the Lord Jesus crushed the head of the old serpent, the Devil (Gen. 3:15). In this way He judged the ruler of this world: &ldquo;Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out&rdquo; (John 12:31). By His death on the cross Christ destroyed the Devil, who had the power of death (Heb. 2:14). Therefore, as the One who died as a serpent in form under God&rsquo;s judgment, the Lord Jesus dealt with the Devil and with his world, the satanic system.</p>
<p>Through the death of Christ, sins, sin, the old man, the entire creation, the Devil, and the world have all been dealt with. This was possible only because Christ was crucified as the Lamb of God, a man in the flesh, the last Adam, a creature, and a serpent in form. As the Lamb of God, Christ took away sin. As a man in the flesh, He made it possible for God to condemn sin in the flesh. As the last Adam He terminated the old man. As a creature, He crucified the entire creation. And as a serpent in form, He destroyed the Devil and the satanic world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. Our Peace and Peacemaker</h2>
<p>Around 1935 I heard a message given by Brother Watchman Nee in Shanghai. He said that if you went to a young believer and asked him who died on the cross, he would say that his Redeemer died on the cross for his sins and his sin. If you went to another one who was more advanced and asked him who died on the cross, he would say that Christ died there, bearing his sins, sin, and himself. Someone still more advanced in the Christian life would tell you that Christ died on the cross for his sins, sin, and himself with all of creation. Another category of Christians would say that Christ died on the cross not only for their sins, sin, and themselves with all of creation, but also in order to destroy Satan and judge the world. Later I began to see that there was the need for even further advancement in realizing the death of Christ, that there was the need to see that through the death of Christ all the ordinances were abolished. All the ordinances&mdash;the habits, customs, traditions, and practices among the human race&mdash;were abolished on the cross. Concerning this aspect of His death, Christ is our peace and Peacemaker (Eph. 2:14-16).</p>
<p>Christ died as the Peacemaker, as the One who makes peace: &ldquo;He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace&rdquo; (vv. 14-15). Christ died on the cross to abolish all the ordinances among mankind. In particular, He died to take away the partition between the Jews and the Gentiles. Not only was there a partition between Jews and Gentiles; there were also partitions between every nationality and race. Without the removal of these partitions, there would be no way for us to be one in Christ as His Body. Praise the Lord that all the ordinances were abolished by Christ on the cross! Now in the church life we have people of all races, colors, and nationalities.</p>
<p>Christ is our peace. Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers, is Himself our peace, our harmony. Due to the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, Israel, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption this separation has been removed. Now, in the redeeming Christ, who is the bond of oneness, both are one.</p>
<p>Christ has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity. The middle wall of partition is &ldquo;the law of the commandments in ordinances,&rdquo; which was given because of man&rsquo;s flesh. The first of these ordinances is circumcision to cut off man&rsquo;s flesh. This became the middle wall of partition between the circumcision and the uncircumcision, the enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles. Christ broke down this middle wall of partition by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances, the law of the ritual commandments, such as the ordinances of circumcision, keeping the Sabbath, and dietary regulations. When Christ was crucified, all the ordinances were nailed to the cross. Because the middle wall of partition has been torn down through Christ&rsquo;s abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, the Jews and the Gentiles can be built up together as the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s death was all-inclusive and was accomplished once for all. There is no need for Him to die again. The Lord&rsquo;s all-inclusive death is eternal. If we see this, we shall praise the Lord that sin, sins, the flesh, the old man, the old creation, Satan, the world, and the ordinances have all been dealt with through the death of Christ.</p>
<p>Because Christ is an all-inclusive person, He died an all-inclusive death. For example, if the king of a certain country were to die, a person with a twofold status&mdash;a man and a king&mdash;would die. As our Redeemer the Lord Jesus had a sixfold status and therefore died as the Lamb of God, a man in the flesh, the last Adam, a creature, a serpent in form, and our peace and Peacemaker. Such an all-inclusive person died an all-inclusive death. Because Christ&rsquo;s death was all-inclusive, when He died on the cross all negative things were dealt with. Sin, sins, the flesh, the old man, the old creation, Satan, the world, and all the ordinances were dealt with. All these negative things were terminated and taken away through the all-inclusive death of Christ, our Redeemer.</p>
<p>As we remain under the Lord&rsquo;s dispensing, all the aspects of His person in redemption will be dispensed into us. We should not try to overcome sin or destroy Satan. If we try to overcome sin, we shall be overcome by it. If we try to destroy Satan, he will destroy us. The only way to overcome sin and destroy Satan is to stay under the dispensing of Christ. Our basic need today is to experience more of the dispensing of the processed Triune God into our being.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(9)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">G. IN SALVATION</h2>
<p>In this message we shall consider the person of Christ in salvation. Some do not know the difference between salvation and redemption. Redemption is what Christ accomplished on the cross. When this redemption is applied to us, it becomes our salvation. Salvation, therefore, is the application of the redemption accomplished by Christ on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Savior</h2>
<p>In salvation Christ is the Savior. He is the Savior in order to save us. Concerning Christ as the Savior, Luke 2:11 says, &ldquo;A Savior was born to you today in David&rsquo;s city, who is Christ the Lord.&rdquo; In John 4:42 the Lord Jesus is referred to as the Savior of the world. The Lord is the Savior of fallen mankind based upon His person and His redemptive work. He is the very God becoming a man to be our Savior, and He has accomplished full redemption for us the sinners, through which He may save us from God&rsquo;s condemnation and from our fallen condition. What He is and what He has accomplished make Him competent to be the able Savior to save us to the uttermost from all our problems.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. Salvation</h2>
<p>Isaiah 40:3 prophesied that John the Baptist was coming to prepare the way for Christ so that He may come to be the salvation of God to all flesh (Luke 3:4-6). When Christ came and was presented to God as a child, the old, righteous and devout Simeon blessed God for Him as God&rsquo;s salvation (Luke 2:30). Christ is not only the Savior. As the Savior He is also the salvation God prepared for us. Apart from Him there is no salvation. If we receive Him, we receive salvation immediately. When Zaccheus received the Lord Jesus, the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house&rdquo; (Luke 19:9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. The Life</h2>
<p>In salvation Christ is not only our objective Savior; He is also our subjective life. In Colossians 3:4 Paul speaks of &ldquo;Christ our life.&rdquo; The expression &ldquo;our life&rdquo; is a strong indication that we need to experience Christ in our daily living. Christ, not our self, our soul, should be our life.</p>
<p>If Christ is not our life in our practical experience, then all He is and all He has attained and obtained will remain objective. Paul&rsquo;s use of the expression &ldquo;our life&rdquo; indicates that we and Christ, and also God Himself, have one life. God, Christ, and the believers all have one life. The life of God is the life of Christ, and the life of Christ has become our life.</p>
<p>To say that Christ is our life means that Christ has become us. This is subjective to the uttermost. If Christ does not become us, how can He be our life?</p>
<p>Christ must be our life in a practical and experiential way. Day by day we need to experience Christ as our life. We should have one life and one living with Him.</p>
<p>Romans 5:10 says, &ldquo;If, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.&rdquo; This verse covers both the reconciling death of Christ and the saving life of Christ. Reconciliation includes redemption and justification. Christ died on the cross for our redemption. Through redemption we have been justified by God and reconciled to Him. Now there is nothing between us and God. However, we still have a number of subjective problems. For this reason, even after we have been reconciled to God, we still need to be saved in Christ&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Although we have been saved already through Christ&rsquo;s death, we still need to be saved in His life. On the one hand, we have been saved from hell and the judgment of God. This was accomplished once for all through the death of Christ on the cross. On the other hand, we still need to be saved from many present problems, including temper, disposition, pride, and jealousy. Although we need to be saved from hundreds of items, in the book of Romans Paul deals with seven major things from which we need to be saved.</p>
<p>First, we need to be saved from the law of sin (Rom. 8:2). Within our flesh, our fallen body, the law of sin works spontaneously and automatically. This law of sin is the power of evil that operates spontaneously within us.</p>
<p>The second negative item from which we need to be saved in Christ&rsquo;s life is worldliness (Rom. 12:2a). We were born into a worldly environment and then raised to be worldly. Worldliness is in our being; hence, it is a subjective matter, a matter of our constitution. The love of the world is an element of our fallen constitution.</p>
<p>The third item is naturalness (Rom. 12:2b). We all have a natural life and a natural disposition. Our constitution is natural. All these natural elements are enemies to God. God has nothing to do with our natural being, our natural life, our natural strength, our natural disposition, or our natural power. These natural elements are deep within our being, much deeper than the law of sin. The law of sin is related mainly to our flesh, but our natural being is our self. For the sake of God&rsquo;s purpose, we need to be saved in the life of Christ from our naturalness.</p>
<p>We also need to be saved from our individualism, that is, from being individualistic (Rom. 12:5). Because we all have the tendency to be individualistic, none of us naturally likes to be one with others. It is not God&rsquo;s intention to have a group of individualistic believers. On the contrary, God&rsquo;s intention is to build up the Body for the fulfillment of His purpose. In order for this purpose to be carried out, we need to be saved from individualism.</p>
<p>The life of Christ also saves us from divisiveness (Rom. 16:17). Our natural man does not like to be one. To be one means to be restricted, bound, and eventually put to death. Throughout the centuries there has been a shortage of oneness among believers. Instead of oneness, there has been division upon division. All divisions come from the element of divisiveness in our fallen nature.</p>
<p>The sixth negative item from which we need to be saved is self-likeness. By self-likeness we mean the appearance and expression of the natural self. We need to be saved from self-likeness by being conformed to the image of the Son of God (Rom. 8:29). In so many respects we do not yet have the likeness of Christ. Instead, we bear the likeness of the self. Therefore, we need to be saved in life from self-likeness, and we need to be conformed to the likeness of the glorious Christ.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to be saved from our natural body (Rom. 8:23). Eventually, in God&rsquo;s full salvation our body will be redeemed, that is, glorified. The day is coming when our physical body will be transfigured.</p>
<p>All that Christ has accomplished on the cross is an objective fact, but we still need a subjective experience of this fact, an experience in life. Christ died on the cross as our Substitute, but there is still the need for us to be identified with Him in His life. The only way Christ&rsquo;s accomplishment in substitution can be applied to us in our experience is by our having Christ as our life. In the Gospel of John He said definitely and emphatically, &ldquo;I am the life&rdquo; (14:6). To be saved in His life is actually to be saved in the person of Christ Himself. As long as we are in Him, we are in the process of being saved in His life.</p><h2 class="head2">4. The Power</h2>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 1:24, Christ is God&rsquo;s power. He Himself is the saving power. To those called by God, the crucified Christ is God&rsquo;s power for carrying out, for accomplishing, what God has planned and purposed. In salvation Christ is the power of God.</p>
<p>We see God&rsquo;s power in the cross of Christ. It takes the power of God to defeat through the cross of Christ, Satan, the world, sin, fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, the old creation, and the ordinances. What other power is greater than Christ crucified as God&rsquo;s power? What other power can destroy Satan or overcome the world? Only God has the power to accomplish these things. This power is not that of doing things by speaking, such as the power of God exercised in creation. Rather, it is the power of crucifixion, the power of the wonderful death of Christ. This means that the crucifixion of Christ has become the power of God. The death of Christ has become God&rsquo;s power to destroy Satan, to solve the problem of the world, to eliminate sin, and to terminate fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, and the old creation. By this power God is able also to solve the problem of the ordinances. By one death, the death of Christ, all the problems in the universe have been cleared. Thus, Christ crucified is God&rsquo;s power to abolish all negative things and to carry out His plan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. The Wisdom</h2>
<p>Christ is not only God&rsquo;s power, but also God&rsquo;s wisdom (1 Cor. 1:24). He has been made wisdom to us from God (1 Cor. 1:30). Wisdom is for planning and purposing, whereas power is for carrying out and accomplishing what is planned and purposed. In God&rsquo;s salvation Christ crucified is both God&rsquo;s power and His wisdom. We need Christ as both power and wisdom.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 1:30 says, &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; &ldquo;Him&rdquo; refers to God. What we believers, as the new creation, are and have in Christ is of God, not of ourselves. It is God who put us in Christ, transferring us from Adam into Christ. It is God who has made Christ wisdom to us. God has put us into Christ, and now we are in Him. Formerly, we were in Adam, but we have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ. This was not an outward transfer; it was an inward transfer of life. In life we have been transferred from one realm into another, from Adam into Christ. We are now in Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God, and Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul does not say that Christ became our wisdom; he says that Christ became wisdom<em> to</em> <em>us.</em> For Christ to become wisdom to us is different from His becoming our wisdom. Day by day, we need Christ to be wisdom to us. Christ being our wisdom is rather general, not experiential. But when Christ becomes wisdom to us, we experience Him.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 the phrases &ldquo;to us&rdquo; and &ldquo;from God&rdquo; are crucial. Christ became wisdom to us from God. The expression &ldquo;to us from God&rdquo; indicates something present, practical, and experiential in the way of transmission. Continually Christ should become wisdom to us from God. This indicates a living, ongoing transmission.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 both the punctuation and the grammar are significant. After the phrase &ldquo;from God&rdquo; there is a colon. This indicates that wisdom includes the three items which follow the colon, that is, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. According to Greek grammar, the word &ldquo;both&rdquo; here is used with respect not to two items but to three. Although this is awkward in our language, the translation is accurate according to the Greek. In this verse Paul definitely says that Christ &ldquo;became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; This wisdom implies righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p>
<p>Christ was made wisdom to us from God as three vital things in God&rsquo;s salvation: righteousness for our past, by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life (Rom. 5:18); sanctification for the present, by which we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with the divine life (Rom. 6:19, 22); and redemption for the future, that is, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23), by which we shall be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness (Phil. 3:21). For us to be fully saved, we must pass through these three steps: regeneration in the spirit, sanctification in the soul, and transfiguration, redemption, in the body. When this process is complete, we shall be the same as the Lord Jesus (1 John 3:2). It is of God that we participate in such a complete and perfect salvation, a salvation that makes our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;organically one with Christ and makes Christ everything to us. This is altogether of God, not of ourselves.</p>
<p>Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption refer not only to three stages of God&rsquo;s salvation, stages related to our past, present, and future, but to three aspects of the nature of God&rsquo;s salvation that we need to experience daily. Every day we need Christ as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. We continually need Christ as our righteousness so that we may be fully justified by God. We need Him as the sanctification of our soul, the sanctification of our mind, emotion, and will. Furthermore, we need Him as the redemption of our body. Strictly speaking, the redemption of the body will take place in the future. Nevertheless, we need and can enjoy Him as this redemption today (Rom. 8:11).</p><h2 class="head2">6. The Author and Perfecter of Faith</h2>
<p>In salvation Christ is also the Author and Perfecter of faith. Hebrews 12:2 says, &ldquo;Looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of faith.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;Author&rdquo; may also be rendered Originator, Inaugurator, Leader, Pioneer, Forerunner. Jesus is the Author of faith; He is the Originator, the Inaugurator, the source and the cause of faith. The Author is the Originator and the Inaugurator. Then He is the source and the cause. Because the Author is the Originator, He is also the Pioneer and Forerunner. Therefore, He is also the Leader and the Captain. If we put all these titles together, we have an adequate definition of Jesus Christ as the Author of faith.</p>
<p>We need Christ as the Author of faith because, according to our natural man, we do not have any believing ability. We do not have faith by ourselves. The faith we have through which we are saved is not of ourselves; it is the gift of God (Eph. 2:8). We have obtained this precious faith by God&rsquo;s gift (2 Pet. 1:1). When we look unto Jesus, He, as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), imparts, dispenses, Himself into us as the believing element to believe for us. Then spontaneously the believing ability arises in our being, and we have the faith to believe in Him. Hence, it is He, Himself, who is our faith. We live by Him as our faith, by His faith (Gal. 2:20), not by our own faith.</p>
<p>Jesus was the Author and the Originator of faith in His life and in His path on earth. He originated faith when He was on earth. The life He lived was a life of faith, and the path He walked was a path of faith. In His life and path He originated faith. Hence, He is the Author of faith.</p>
<p>Jesus, being the Pioneer and Forerunner, has cut the way of faith. His life was a cutting life, a life that cut the way of faith. Wherever He went, it seems that there was a &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; or a &ldquo;river&rdquo; frustrating Him. But step after step He cut the way of faith, closing the gaps and removing the mountains like the builder of a highway. Because He has cut the way of faith, He is also the Pioneer and Forerunner on the pathway of faith.</p>
<p>As the Pioneer and Forerunner of faith, Christ is also the Leader and Captain of faith. He has cut the way of faith and, as the Forerunner, has taken the lead to pioneer it. Hence, He, as the Captain, can carry us through the pathway of faith in His footsteps. As we look unto Him as the Originator of faith in His life and in His path on earth and as the Perfecter of faith in His glory and on His throne in heaven, He transfuses and even infuses us in a very subjective way with the faith which He has originated and perfected.</p>
<p>Christ is also the Perfecter of faith. The Greek word translated &ldquo;Perfecter&rdquo; in Hebrews 12:2 may also be rendered Finisher or Completer. Christ is the Finisher, the Completer, of faith. By looking unto Him continually, we shall have Him finish and complete the faith which we need. Christ is the Perfecter of faith mainly in His glory and on His throne in heaven. He is sitting on the throne in glory to complete the faith which He originated while He was on earth. Being the Finisher and Completer of faith, He will finish and complete what He has originated and inaugurated.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. The Forerunner</h2>
<p>Hebrews 6:18-20 says that the believers &ldquo;have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us, which we have as an anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that which is within the veil, where the Forerunner, Jesus, is entered for us, become forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus has entered the heavens as the Holy of Holies within the veil, and with Him is the heavenly haven for our refuge, which we can now enter in our spirit (Heb. 10:19). The anchor signifies that we are on a stormy sea and that without the anchor of hope we may shipwreck (1 Tim. 1:19). The entering is the entering into the heavens, the Holy of Holies within the veil today, where the Lord Jesus entered. Our hope, as a secure and firm anchor, has entered there, and we also may now enter in spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord as the Forerunner took the lead to pass through the stormy sea and enter the heavenly haven to be the High Priest for us according to the order of Melchisedec, the order of the priesthood that is in both humanity and divinity. As the Forerunner He has cut the way into glory.</p>
<p>In order to enter into the Holy of Holies within the veil as our Forerunner, the Lord Jesus fled everything. He fled His mother and His brothers (Matt. 12:46-50), and He fled Judaism, so that He entered &ldquo;into that which is within the veil,&rdquo; that is, into the presence of God, where He is now the Forerunner and High Priest to minister to us that we may be brought into glory. He is the Forerunner in glory; He is also the Captain leading us into the very place where He is as the Forerunner.</p>
<h2 class="head2">8. The Captain of Salvation</h2>
<p>In Hebrews 2:10 Christ is called the Captain of salvation. This indicates that in His salvation Christ is leading an army composed of the saved ones as the soldiers. As the Captain of salvation, Christ is leading an army of believers into glory. Every day He is leading us into glory, into the expression of God. While Christ is leading us into glory, He is the glory within us. This is Christ as the Captain of salvation. He is saving us into glory. The very Christ who dwells in us, who dispenses Himself into us, and whom we are now enjoying is, in God&rsquo;s salvation, the Savior, salvation, life, power, wisdom, the Author and Perfecter of faith, the Forerunner, and the Captain of salvation.</p>
<p>The salvation of which Christ is the Captain is the salvation that brings us into glory. As our Captain, Christ the Savior took the lead to fight through into glory. He did not enter into glory suddenly. During all His years on earth, a fighting process was taking place. The seed of glory was in Him and was fighting its way out. In the Gospels, the life of Jesus was a life of fighting. He was always fighting the battle for the seed of glory. He fought that the glory might come out and that He might be brought into glory. He fought for His glorification, and His fighting paved the way into glory. In this matter of fighting for glory, He was the Pioneer, for He pioneered the way into glory. Therefore, He is qualified to be the Captain of those who are entering into glory, and He is called the Captain of our salvation.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s goal is to bring His many sons into glory (Heb. 2:10). Christ, as the Pioneer, has fought His way into this glory, and now He is the Captain of salvation leading God&rsquo;s many sons into His glory. The Christ who has come into us is not only the Savior; He is also the One who took the lead to enter into glory, into the full expression of God.</p>
<p>Christ entered into glory as the Pioneer and now He dwells in the full, glorious expression of the divine being. As the One in glory, He is the Captain of our salvation, who one day came into us and now dwells in our spirit. But in His coming into us He did not leave the glory. Rather, He brought the glory into us. This means that when the Captain of salvation came into us, the glory came with Him. The Captain of salvation came into us to be the glory. He came in to be the seed of glory. Now we all have this seed of glory, that is, the Captain of salvation Himself, within us, leading us into glory, into the expression of God. Eventually, when our whole being has been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, the glory will come out of us. When we experience this glorification, we shall be fully in the expression of God.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">(10)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover some deep and profound matters concerning Christ&rsquo;s person in reproduction and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">H. IN REPRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Christ has a reproduction, and in His reproduction He is a grain of wheat. John 12:24 says, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; Here the Lord Jesus indicates that He, as a grain of wheat, will fall into the ground and die in order to produce many grains as His reproduction. In Christ&rsquo;s resurrection we are His reproduction. Concerning this, Peter says, &ldquo;The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ...has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:3). When Christ was resurrected, we, His believers, were all included in Him. We were resurrected with Him (Eph. 2:6). In His resurrection Christ imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and nature to be His reproduction. He was a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die. When He grew up in resurrection He produced many grains. The many grains are His reproduction, His multiplication, and this reproduction is His propagation. Through His death and resurrection He has been multiplied and propagated. This propagation is for the producing of the church. Through His death and resurrection He has produced the church as His reproduction.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. IN RESURRECTION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Firstfruit of Resurrection</h2>
<p>In resurrection Christ is the Firstfruit of resurrection. First Corinthians 15:20 says, &ldquo;Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep.&rdquo; In verse 23 of the same chapter Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Each one in his own order: the firstfruit, Christ; after that those who are Christ&rsquo;s at His coming.&rdquo; In these verses Christ is set forth as the Firstfruit of resurrection. Christ was the first one raised from among the dead as the firstfruit of resurrection. This was typified by the firstfruits in Leviticus 23:10 and 11, offered to God on the day after the Sabbath, the day of resurrection (Matt. 28:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Firstborn from among the Dead</h2>
<p>As the Firstfruit of resurrection, Christ is the Firstborn from among the dead: &ldquo;He is the Head of the Body, the church; who is the beginning, Firstborn from among the dead&rdquo; (Col. 1:18). Christ being &ldquo;the Firstborn from among the dead&rdquo; is for the new creation in resurrection, which is the church, the Body of Christ. As the first in resurrection Christ is the Head of the Body. He is the One who has the first place, the preeminence, in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. The Son of God Designated in Power</h2>
<p>In resurrection Christ is the Son of God designated in power. In Romans 1:4 Paul says that Christ &ldquo;was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.&rdquo; Before His incarnation and resurrection, Christ already was the Son of God. After He became incarnate, however, His divine nature was concealed by the flesh. But when He entered into resurrection, He was designated in power as being the Son of God. Therefore, resurrection was Christ&rsquo;s designation as the Son of God.</p>
<p>Christ first passed through the process of incarnation to become flesh. Then He passed through the process of death and resurrection. By means of the second step of this process He was designated the Son of God out of resurrection. Although Christ already was the Son of God before the incarnation, He still needed to be designated the Son of God out of resurrection because by incarnation He had put on an element, the human nature, that had nothing to do with divinity. Christ was already the Son of God in His divinity, but that part of Him which was Jesus with the human nature born of Mary, was not the Son of God. By His resurrection Christ sanctified and uplifted His human nature, His humanity, and He was designated out of resurrection as the Son of God with this human nature. In this sense He was begotten the Son of God in His resurrection (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5).</p>
<p>Although Christ was the Son of God, this could not be recognized easily. By being &ldquo;sown&rdquo; into death and growing up in resurrection, He &ldquo;blossomed.&rdquo; By this process He was designated the Son of God, and by this process He uplifted the human nature. Christ did not put off His human nature when He entered into resurrection. Instead of putting off humanity, He sanctified it, uplifted it, and transformed it, and He had Himself designated with this transformed humanity the Son of God with the divine power. When He was the Son of God before His incarnation, He did not have human nature. Now in resurrection He is the Son of God with humanity uplifted, sanctified, and transformed.</p>
<p>Those responsible for the death of Christ did not realize that crucifixion was a step on the way for Him to be designated the Son of God in resurrection. Satan expected that the crucifixion would mark His termination, but the Lord Jesus knew that this was actually the beginning, that it would lead to His designation according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>As the designated Son of God, Christ still has two natures, divinity and humanity. However, the humanity He now has is not a natural humanity but a humanity uplifted in resurrection. Even His human nature has been designated the Son of God. He has been designated the Son of God with both divinity and humanity.</p>
<p>Through designation in resurrection the Christ who was already the Son of God before His incarnation became the Son of God in a new way. Before His incarnation He was the Son of God only with divinity. But now, through His resurrection, He has been designated the Son of God both with divinity and humanity. If Christ had not put on human nature, there would have been no need for Him to be designated the Son of God, for in His divinity He was already the Son of God, even from eternity. But having put on humanity through incarnation, He was designated the Son of God with humanity in resurrection.</p>
<p>Romans 1:4 says that this designation was according to the Spirit of holiness. There is a distinction between the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of holiness. Holiness refers to the divine essence, the substance of God&rsquo;s being. The Spirit of holiness is the Spirit of the divine essence, whereas the Holy Spirit is the Person of the Spirit. As the Son of God, Christ is constituted of the Spirit of holiness; the Spirit of holiness is His very element. It was according to the Spirit of holiness that Christ was designated the Son of God in resurrection.</p>
<p>The Spirit of holiness is the life-essence within the Lord Jesus. When He lived on earth in the flesh, He had this divine life-essence within Him. As a flower is designated according to the life-essence within it, so Christ was designated by resurrection according to the divine life-essence in Him. When He resurrected from among the dead, He was designated in power by resurrection according to the Spirit of holiness that was in Him. Now He is the Son of God in a way that is more wonderful than before, for now He has both the divine nature and the resurrected, transformed, uplifted, glorified, and designated human nature.</p><h2 class="head2">4. The Firstborn Son of God</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was His birth as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. Acts 13:33 reveals that to the man Jesus resurrection was a birth. He was begotten by God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity (John 1:18; 3:16). After incarnation and through resurrection He was begotten by God in His humanity to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. This was prophesied in Psalm 2:7: &ldquo;Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.&rdquo; Acts 13:33, which quotes from Psalm 2:7, indicates that Christ was begotten as the Son of God on the day of His resurrection. He needed to be begotten by resurrection because He had put on humanity. As to His divinity there was no need for Him to be begotten as the Son of God. But as to His humanity there was the need for this. On the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection His human nature was uplifted and transfigured into a glorious substance. This was the begetting in power by resurrection. This begetting was also His designation. In this way Jesus was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God and designated the Son of God.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;Firstborn&rdquo; in Romans 8:29 indicates that in addition to the firstborn Son of God there will be other sons. Hebrews 2:10 speaks of many sons, and Romans 8:29, of many brothers. In resurrection Christ came to His brothers, who compose His church, and declared the Father&rsquo;s name to them (Heb. 2:12).</p>
<p>Through incarnation God&rsquo;s only begotten Son put on humanity and became the God-man. Then in resurrection this God-man was born of God to be His Firstborn. Before incarnation God&rsquo;s only begotten Son did not have human nature, only the divine nature. However, in resurrection God&rsquo;s firstborn Son has a human nature as well as the divine nature.</p>
<p>As believers in Christ, we all are sons of God and brothers of the firstborn Son. Through regeneration we have the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Although we are human beings, we now have the divine nature. Although the Lord Jesus is divine, He also has the human nature. Both the Lord Jesus and we are the same in that both He and we have the human nature and the divine nature. In His resurrection the Lord was born of God to be His firstborn Son. His resurrection was the release of the divine life and nature, and through this release He was begotten as the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>As the Son of God, Christ has passed through two births. The first birth took place at His incarnation, and the second, in His resurrection. In the first birth He was born as a son of man. After living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, Christ was crucified. Then in the second birth in resurrection He was born as the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>Through the two births of Christ divinity has been brought into humanity, and humanity has been brought into divinity. By the incarnation of Christ God was brought into man. Prior to Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, God was outside of man. However, through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation God was brought into humanity. With the birth of Christ God was born into man. Therefore, by Christ&rsquo;s first birth in incarnation God was brought into man and became one with man. Then through Christ&rsquo;s second birth in resurrection man was brought into God and became one with God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. A Resurrected Man<br />
with a Spiritual Body of Flesh and Bones</h2>
<p>On the day of His resurrection Christ came back to the disciples with a resurrected body, coming into the room where the disciples were with the doors shut (John 20:19). Since the doors were shut, how could He enter the room with a body of flesh and bones? Our limited mentality cannot comprehend this, but it is a fact, and we must receive it according to the divine revelation.</p>
<p>Christ in resurrection is a resurrected man with a spiritual body of flesh and bones. We cannot understand how a body of flesh and bones can be spiritual, but with the resurrected Christ flesh and bones have become spiritual. This means that He has a spiritual body, yet the body is physical.</p>
<p>Luke 24:36 and 37 say, &ldquo;As they were speaking these things, He Himself stood in their midst and said to them, Peace to you! But they were startled and became frightened and thought they beheld a spirit.&rdquo; The disciples were troubled by the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. They could not understand how He could suddenly appear in the room. The door was closed, and no one opened it. Nevertheless, the Lord appeared with a physical body.</p>
<p>The Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;Why are you troubled, and why are reasonings arising in your heart? See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having&rdquo; (vv. 38-39). Then He showed them His hands and feet (v. 40). Here we see Christ&rsquo;s resurrected body, which is spiritual (1 Cor. 15:44).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s appearing was very mysterious. He came into the room as the Spirit, yet with a physical, touchable body. The prints of the nails could still be seen. The place in His side that had been pierced with a spear could still be seen and touched. Not only was the Lord&rsquo;s body visible and touchable, but He was able to eat food: &ldquo;While they still did not believe for joy and were marveling, He said to them, Do you have anything to eat here? And they handed Him part of a broiled fish; and He took it and ate before them&rdquo; (Luke 24:41-43). We do not understand how the Lord Jesus as One with a spiritual body was still able to eat material food.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:44 Paul speaks concerning the resurrection body: &ldquo;It is sown a soulish body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a soulish body, there is also a spiritual body.&rdquo; A soulish body is a natural body animated by the soul, a body in which the soul predominates. A spiritual body is a resurrected body saturated by the spirit, a body in which the spirit predominates. After His resurrection Christ had such a spiritual body, yet it was a body with flesh and bones.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3:21 Paul speaks of Christ&rsquo;s body of glory. Christ&rsquo;s body of glory is His resurrected body, saturated with God&rsquo;s glory (Luke 24:26) and transcendent over corruption and death (Rom. 6:9).</p><h2 class="head2">6. The Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into His believers (1 Cor. 15:45b). The last Adam, Christ, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection. We know that it was in resurrection that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit by the fact that the entire chapter of 1 Corinthians 15 is on resurrection. The context of this chapter proves that it was in resurrection that Christ became the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>In John 14:16 and 17 the Lord Jesus speaks of another Comforter, even the Spirit of reality. The word &ldquo;another&rdquo; indicates that the Lord, the One speaking, is a Comforter. If He were not a Comforter, then He would not have said that He would ask the Father to send another Comforter. If we read John 14:16-20 carefully, we shall see that, eventually, the second Comforter is actually the first Comforter as the Spirit. In verse 17 the Lord says that the Spirit of reality will be in the disciples. Then in verse 18 He continues, &ldquo;I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.&rdquo; The &ldquo;He&rdquo; who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 now becomes the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the Lord Himself, in verse 18. This indicates that after His resurrection the Lord would become the Spirit of reality. Furthermore, the Lord speaks of another Comforter in verse 16 and then says in verse 20, &ldquo;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; Here the Lord again reveals that He Himself would be in the disciples as the Spirit, as the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</p>
<p>Christ became the Spirit through death and resurrection. According to 1 Corinthians 15:45b, Christ, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit. On the day of His resurrection Christ breathed into His disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 20:22). We may say that Christ already was the Spirit when He was in the flesh. The difference here is that His flesh was a covering comparable to a shell. Through death and resurrection the opaque shell of the flesh became transparent. Therefore, now we can see that the Lord is the Spirit. Through death and resurrection the last Adam in the opaque shell of the flesh became the life-giving Spirit. This is still the same Jesus, but now the shell is transparent. The One who was with the disciples is the same One who is now the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection includes the fact that He, the last Adam, the One who is the Lamb of God, the Redeemer, has become the life-giving Spirit. Both the Redeemer and the life-giving Spirit are precious. For our enjoyment we need the Redeemer and the life-giving Spirit. We treasure both the Redeemer and the life-giving Spirit. In death the Lord Jesus was the Lamb, the Redeemer, and in resurrection He is the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>In resurrection Christ comes to us as the Spirit, as the pneumatic Christ (John 20:19-22). Not only has Christ become the life-giving Spirit, but when He comes to us, He comes as the Spirit. He comes as the pneumatic Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came to His disciples as the pneumatic Christ on the day of His resurrection. In chapter twenty of the Gospel of John, the Lord came to His disciples, who were in a place where the doors were shut, as the <em>pneuma.</em> The Greek word <em>pneuma</em> means spirit; it also means breath or air. In John 1 Christ is the Lamb, but in John 20, after His death and in His resurrection, He is the pneumatic Christ. The first time He came, He came as the Lamb of God. The second time He came as the <em>pneuma.</em> According to John 20:22, &ldquo;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This indicates that the Lord came to the disciples as breath.</p>
<p>When we receive Christ today, we receive the pneumatic Christ. This means that we receive not only the redeeming Christ but also the life-giving Christ. Day by day we are enjoying not only the redeeming Christ but also the life-giving Christ, the pneumatic Christ.</p>
<p>To say that Christ is the pneumatic Christ means that He is full of divine breath. Just as a car tire must be pneumatic, that is, full of air, so every Christian should be pneumatic, full of heavenly breath. In our daily life we should not be &ldquo;flat,&rdquo; short of divine breath.</p>
<p>Our spiritual breath is the life-giving Spirit. In resurrection Christ has come to us as this Spirit, the <em>pneuma.</em> The Lord became the pneumatic Christ through resurrection. Now in resurrection our Christ, the Redeemer, is the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">7. The Lord Spirit</h2>
<p>In resurrection Christ is the Lord Spirit: &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:18). The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ. This expression strongly proves that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and that the Spirit is the Lord Christ. The previous verse says that the Lord is the Spirit, and this verse definitely speaks of Christ as the Lord Spirit.</p>
<p>It is in resurrection that Christ is the Lord Spirit. When He was in the flesh, He was not called the Spirit. But when He entered into resurrection, He became in resurrection the life-giving Spirit, and in resurrection He is called the Lord Spirit.</p>
<p>The image in 2 Corinthians 3:18 is the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ. The &ldquo;same image&rdquo; means we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being the Lord Spirit is for our transformation. We are being transformed into Christ&rsquo;s glorious image, and this transformation is a matter of dispensing.</p>
<p>Transformation is not merely an outward change. An outward change does not require the addition of the divine life element. But if we are to be transformed into the image of Christ, the divine life element must be added into us. The divine element is added into us by God&rsquo;s dispensing. God is dispensing His element into us so that we may have transformation and not merely an outward change. Transformation is a metabolic change, and for this we need God&rsquo;s dispensing. We must have the dispensing of the Triune God into us. Day by day we need to have contact with the Dispenser, the One who dispenses Himself directly into our being. When we have contact with Him and stay in the organic union with Him, we shall enjoy His dispensing of Himself into us. This is all by Christ as the Lord Spirit that we may be transformed into His image from glory to glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">8. Christ in the Believers</h2>
<p>In resurrection Christ is in the believers. Three verses that say definitely that Christ is in us are Romans 8:10; Colossians 1:27; and 2 Corinthians 13:5. Romans 8:10 says, &ldquo;If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.&rdquo; The preposition &ldquo;in&rdquo; here is most remarkable. Christ, the wonderful One, is actually in us. In order for Christ to be in us, He must be the Spirit. According to the context, Christ dwells in us as the Spirit.</p>
<p>Concerning Christ in resurrection being in the believers, Colossians 1:27 says, &ldquo;To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; According to the book of Colossians, the Christ who is in us is the portion of the saints (1:12), the image of the invisible God (1:15), the Firstborn of all creation (1:15), the Firstborn from among the dead (1:18), the One in whom all God&rsquo;s fullness dwells (2:9), the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy (1:25-27), the mystery of God (2:2), the reality of all positive things (2:17), and the constituent of the new man (3:10-11). What a Christ we have within us! This indwelling Christ is the life-giving Spirit in resurrection. As the Spirit, Christ now is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) to be one spirit with us (1 Cor. 6:17). As the life-giving Spirit mingled with our spirit, He is our life and our person (Col. 3:4; Eph. 3:17).</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 13:5 Paul says, &ldquo;Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves; or do you not recognize yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?&rdquo; To test is to determine our condition; to prove is to qualify our status. Paul tells the Corinthians to test themselves whether they are in the objective faith (Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 1:19). If anyone is in the objective faith, he surely has the subjective faith and believes in Christ and the entire content of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Paul specifically asked the Corinthians whether they recognized that Jesus Christ was in them. As long as a believer realizes that Jesus Christ is in him, he is qualified, approved, as a genuine member of Christ. Second Corinthians 13:5 is another verse revealing the fact that in resurrection Christ lives in the believers.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(11)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall consider Christ&rsquo;s person in ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head1">J. IN ASCENSION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. Son of Man</h2>
<p>In ascension Christ is the Son of Man. This means that the Christ who is in the heavens still has His humanity; He still possesses a human nature.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was being judged by the Sanhedrin, the high priest said to Him, &ldquo;I adjure you by the living God that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God&rdquo; (Matt. 26:63). The Lord replied, &ldquo;You said it! Moreover, I say to you, Henceforth you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven&rdquo; (v. 64). The high priest asked the Lord if He was the Son of God, but He answered by referring to Himself as the Son of Man. The Lord was the Son of Man on earth before His crucifixion, and He is still the Son of Man in the heavens at the right hand of God after His resurrection and ascension. Furthermore, even at His coming back on the clouds He will be the Son of Man. The Lord seemed to be saying to the high priests, &ldquo;You ask Me whether or not I am the Son of God. I tell you that I am the Son of Man. Even after you have crucified Me and I have been resurrected from the dead, I shall be in the third heaven as a man.&rdquo; In ascension Christ continues to be the Son of Man.</p>
<p>Stephen saw the ascended Christ as the Son of Man: &ldquo;Being full of the Holy Spirit, looking intently into heaven, he saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God&rdquo; (Acts 7:55-56). This is further proof that in ascension Christ is still the Son of Man.</p>
<p>Revelation 1:13 indicates that the ascended Christ is the Son of Man: &ldquo;In the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man.&rdquo; Here Christ is unveiled as the Son of Man. He is both divine and human. As the High Priest He cares for the churches in His humanity.</p>
<p>Some do not believe that Christ today is still the Son of Man. They claim that Christ became a man by incarnation but that in His resurrection He put off His humanity. They think that Christ today is merely the Son of God, that He is no longer the Son of Man. However, it is erroneous to teach that Christ in ascension is no longer the Son of Man. In ascension Christ is still both the Son of God with divinity and the Son of Man with humanity. This is clearly revealed in the Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The One Who Is at the Right Hand of God</h2>
<p>In ascension Christ is the One who is at the right hand of God. Romans 8:34 says, &ldquo;Christ Jesus who died, but rather who was raised, who is even at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.&rdquo; Christ died for us, He was resurrected, and He is now in the heavens at the right hand of God interceding for us. In ascension Christ is at the right hand of God. &ldquo;The right hand of God&rdquo; signifies preeminence, the first place of honor. The right hand of God is the first and highest place in the universe, and God has put the ascended Christ there. God has given the preeminence and the highest honor in the entire universe to Christ. Our Christ today is in the highest heaven, holding the highest position at God&rsquo;s right hand.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. The One Crowned with Glory and Honor</h2>
<p>In ascension Christ is the One who has been crowned with glory and honor. Hebrews 2:9 says, &ldquo;We see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor.&rdquo; Here glory and honor are considered a crown. Glory is the splendor related to Jesus&rsquo; person; honor is the preciousness related to Jesus&rsquo; worth (1 Pet. 2:7). As the ascended One crowned with glory and honor, Christ is in a state of glory and has a rank of honor.</p>
<p>It is always an honor for a person to have a high rank. The ascended Christ is glorious in state and honorable in rank. He has received such glory and has entered into such an honor. This glory and honor are the crown with which He has been crowned.</p>
<p>On earth in His suffering of death, Christ was crowned with thorns. But in heaven on the throne in His enjoyment of exaltation, He is crowned with glory and honor. Let us look away from everything to the ascended Christ who is crowned with glory and honor.</p><h2 class="head2">4. The One Enthroned for God&rsquo;s Administration</h2>
<p>Another aspect of Christ in ascension is that He is the One enthroned for God&rsquo;s administration. Hebrews 12:2 says that Christ is now &ldquo;seated at the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo; For Christ to be seated at the right hand of the throne of God does not mean that He is seated next to the throne of God, at God&rsquo;s right hand. In Revelation we see that there is only one throne of both God and Christ (Rev. 3:21; 22:1, 3), one throne for both God and the Lamb. Christ has been enthroned in His ascension. His ascension was for His enthronement for God&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>According to the book of Revelation, the throne on which the ascended Christ is sitting is the throne of the divine administration: &ldquo;I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth&rdquo; (Rev. 5:6). The Lamb, the Redeemer, the One slain on the cross for our sins, is now on the throne carrying out God&rsquo;s administration over the entire universe. The Lord Jesus has been enthroned to execute God&rsquo;s governmental operation in the universe. As the Lamb with the seven eyes, the seven Spirits of God, He is carrying out God&rsquo;s administration for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. Ruler of the Kings of the Earth</h2>
<p>In ascension Christ is also the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5). As the Ruler of the kings He is far above all earthly rulers. Apparently the earth is ruled by kings and presidents; actually the Lord Jesus rules the whole earth through the earthly authorities. Even all the kings and presidents are under His rule. Today He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords (Rev. 19:16). He is the Ruler of all the ones who are in power. He is the chief Ruler in the divine government for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. Leader and Savior</h2>
<p>Acts 5:31 says that God has exalted Christ &ldquo;to His right hand as a Leader and Savior.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; is <em>archegos,</em> meaning author, origin, originator, chief leader, captain. This word is used only four times in the New Testament and always in reference to Christ (Acts 3:15; Heb. 2:10; 12:2). It has been translated a number of different ways in various versions because there is no precise English equivalent to the Greek. The thought is that this One is the origin and Originator, the Author, the Leader, and the Inaugurator. He is above all and spontaneously is the Ruler with authority. God has exalted Jesus, the One rejected and killed by the Jewish leaders, as the highest Leader. His being the Leader is a matter related to His authority. He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority so that the environment may be fit for God&rsquo;s chosen people to receive His salvation (Acts 17:26-27; John 17:2).</p>
<p>The One God has exalted to His right hand is also the Savior. Jesus&rsquo; incarnation made Him a man, His human living on earth qualified Him to be man&rsquo;s Savior, His crucifixion accomplished full redemption for man, His resurrection vindicated His redemptive work, and His exaltation inaugurated Him to be the ruling Leader so that He might be the Savior.</p>
<p>When Christ was on earth, He saved Peter, John, and many others. However, although the title Savior is applied to Christ in His earthly ministry (John 4:42), He was not officially the Savior until His ascension. We were saved officially by the Christ on the throne, by the One in glory. When we were saved, we were seated with Him in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:6). Christ has saved us from the throne and to the throne. This is the ascended Christ as our Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. Lord of All</h2>
<p>In ascension Christ is Lord of all (Acts 2:36; 10:36). As God, Christ was the Lord all the time (Luke 1:43; John 11:21; 20:28). But as man He was made the Lord in His ascension after He brought His humanity into God in His resurrection. In ascension Christ was made the Lord of all to possess all. In Acts 10:36 Peter speaks of Christ as the One who is &ldquo;Lord of all.&rdquo; &ldquo;All&rdquo; refers here to all men, all peoples. Christ in His ascension is the Lord not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles. He is the Lord of all the different races and peoples on earth.</p>
<p>Acts 2:36 tells us that Christ was made Lord. As we have seen, He was Lord before His ascension, but He was not officially inaugurated into this office. One of the Old Testament names for God is Lord (Heb., <em>Adonai),</em> meaning master. Christ in the Old Testament was Adonai. Then He became a man, a despised Nazarene. This very One was Lord even when He was on earth. But it was not until His ascension that He was inaugurated into His lordship. Christ in His ascension was inaugurated as Lord of all, not only of all men, but also of all things.</p>
<p>As the Lord, Christ now possesses the whole universe, God&rsquo;s chosen people, and all positive things, matters, and persons. Christ is the Lord not only of God&rsquo;s chosen people, but also of the angels and of all those who will be in the millennium and in the new heaven and the new earth. Therefore, He is the Lord of the heavens, the earth, and everything and everyone He has redeemed. In ascension He is the Lord of all to possess all.</p><h2 class="head2">8. Christ for His Heavenly Ministry</h2>
<p>Christ in His ascension is also the Christ for His heavenly ministry. Acts 2:36 reveals that in His ascension Christ was made not only the Lord but also the Christ, God&rsquo;s anointed (Heb. 1:9), to carry out God&rsquo;s commission. In ascension He was anointed, appointed by God for His ministry in the heavens. When He was on earth, He was anointed and appointed for His earthly ministry. But in His ascension He was made the Christ to carry out God&rsquo;s commission through His heavenly ministry.</p>
<p>Not until His ascension was Christ officially inaugurated as the Christ. On the day of Pentecost Peter said, &ldquo;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ&mdash;this Jesus whom you crucified&rdquo; (Acts 2:36). In eternity Christ was already Christ. Furthermore, as God&rsquo;s sent and anointed One in His humanity, He was Christ from the time He was born (Luke 2:11; Matt. 1:16; John 1:41; Matt. 16:16). Then at His baptism He was anointed by God with His Spirit (Luke 4:18). However, He was not officially inaugurated as the Christ until His ascension. Christ has been not only chosen, appointed, and anointed by God but also inaugurated by God into His office. He has passed through death and resurrection and in ascension is now enthroned in the heavens as the Christ. In ascension He was officially made the Christ of God for His heavenly ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">9. Head over All Things to the Church</h2>
<p>In ascension Christ is also Head over all things to the church. According to Ephesians 1:20-22, God&rsquo;s surpassingly great power has been &ldquo;wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead, and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming; and He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.&rdquo; In ascension God gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church. The headship of Christ over all things is a gift from God to Him. It was through God&rsquo;s surpassingly great power that Christ received the headship in the universe. It was given to Him as a man in His humanity with His divinity to be Head over all things.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:22 does not mean that God gave Christ to the church as a gift. This verse means that God gave Christ a gift&mdash;the headship over all things. According to this understanding, a great gift was given to Christ by God, and this gift is the headship over all things.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:22 says that God gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church. The phrase &ldquo;to the church&rdquo; implies a transmission from the ascended Christ to the church, His Body. Whatever Christ, the Head, attained and obtained is transmitted to the church. In this transmission the church shares with Christ all His attainments: the resurrection from among the dead, being seated in His transcendency, the subjection of all things under His feet, and the headship over all things.</p>
<p>If Paul had concluded Ephesians 1 by saying that God gave Christ to be Head over all things, Christ&rsquo;s ascension would not have anything to do with the church. Paul, however, added the important phrase &ldquo;to the church.&rdquo; This implies that whatever Christ has attained and obtained is being transmitted to the church, His Body. Because the divine transmission is not once for all, the church should continually receive this transmission. God raised up Christ, seated Him in the heavens, put everything under His feet, and gave Him the great gift of being the Head over all things. Now whatever Christ is in His ascension is being transmitted into the church. This is the continual transmission into the church of the ascended Christ with the full significance of His ascension. We should experience this divine transmission day by day.</p>
<h2 class="head2">10. The God-exalted One<br />
Receiving the Name Which Is above Every Name</h2>
<p>In ascension Christ is the God-exalted One, the One who has received the name which is above every name. Philippians 2:9 says, &ldquo;Wherefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name.&rdquo; How marvelous Christ is! He humbled Himself to the uttermost, but God exalted Him to the highest peak.</p>
<p>The name referred to in Philippians 2:9 is the name of Jesus, as indicated in the following verse. From the time of Christ&rsquo;s ascension, there has never been a name on earth above the name of Jesus. God has exalted Jesus to be the Lord of all. Therefore, it is altogether right for us to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; We need to confess the Lord&rsquo;s name openly. In the New Testament there is the clear word that we are to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name (Acts 2:21; Rom. 10:13). By His exaltation the Lord has been given a name which is above every name. There has never been a name in history higher than the name of the Lord Jesus. The highest name in the universe, the greatest name, is the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>In Philippians 2:10 and 11 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.&rdquo; The name is the expression of the sum total of what the Lord Jesus is in His person and work. The words &ldquo;in the name&rdquo; mean in the sphere and element of all the Lord is.</p>
<p>In verse 10 are the three levels of the universe: heaven, earth, and under the earth. Those who are in heaven are angels, those who are on earth are men, and those who are under the earth are the dead. The day is coming when those on every level will bow their knees and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. To openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord is to call on the Lord (Rom. 10:9-10, 12-13). The Lord Jesus as a man was made the Lord in His ascension by God. Thus, every tongue should confess that He is Lord. This confession is to the glory of God the Father. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;to&rdquo; in Philippians 2:11 means resulting in. Our confessing that Jesus is Lord results in the glory of God the Father.</p><h2 class="head2">11. The Righteous</h2>
<p>In ascension Christ is the Righteous. First John 2:1b says, &ldquo;If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.&rdquo; Our Lord Jesus is the only righteous man among all men. Only He is qualified to be our Advocate to care for us in our sinning condition and restore us to a righteous condition so that our Father, who is righteous, may be appeased.</p>
<p>Instead of saying &ldquo;Jesus Christ the Righteous,&rdquo; we may say &ldquo;Jesus Christ, the right One.&rdquo; Jesus Christ certainly is the One who is right, the right One, and only this right One can be our Advocate with the Father, taking care of our case.</p>
<p>Christ was the righteous One in His earthly life, for He was right with God and man. Now, in the heavens, He is still the righteous One. As the ascended One in the heavens, Christ does everything in a righteous way. He is working and ministering righteously. If He were not acting righteously in the heavens, He could not be in God&rsquo;s presence. Whatever Christ is doing now in the heavens to intercede for us and to minister life to us as the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, He does righteously. His heavenly ministry of life today is a ministry in righteousness. In ascension He truly is the Righteous.</p>
<p>As our Representative, or Attorney, in the heavenly court, Christ is the righteous One. Just as an attorney cannot practice law if he is unrighteous, a lawbreaker, so Christ could not be our Attorney if He were not righteous. Christ, the Righteous, is surely the Lawkeeper, thus qualified to be our Advocate, our Attorney.</p>
<h2 class="head2">12. Paraclete</h2>
<p>In ascension Christ is the Paraclete (1 John 2:1). He is the righteous One to be our Paraclete. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;Advocate&rdquo; in 1 John 2:1 is <em>parakletos,</em> and it denotes one who is called to another&rsquo;s side to help him, hence, a helper; one who offers legal aid or one who intercedes on behalf of someone else, hence, an advocate, counsel, or intercessor. The word also denotes consoling and consolation, hence, a consoler, a comforter. Paraclete is its anglicized form. This word is used in the Gospel of John (14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7) for the Spirit of reality as our Comforter within us, caring for our cause or affairs. It is used in 1 John 2:1 for the Lord Jesus as our Advocate with the Father, the One who cares for our case, intercedes on our behalf (Rom. 8:34), and pleads for us if we sin. This interceding and pleading is based on His propitiation.</p>
<p>Christ as our Paraclete, our Advocate in 1 John 2:1 is actually our spiritual attorney. J. N. Darby, in his note on 1 John 2:1, explains that Christ as our Advocate is like a Roman patron, who maintained the interest of his client in every way. Whenever we sin, the Father has a case against us. Therefore, we need a heavenly attorney to take care of our case. We need the Lord Jesus to be our Advocate, our Paraclete.</p>
<h2 class="head2">13. High Priest</h2>
<p>In His ascension Christ was also made the High Priest in the heavens. Hebrews 4:14 says that we have a &ldquo;great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.&rdquo; The Lord came from God to us through incarnation, and then He went back from us to God through resurrection and ascension to be our High Priest to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs (Heb. 2:17-18; 4:15). Therefore, Hebrews 7:26 says, &ldquo;Such a High Priest befits us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens.&rdquo; In His ascension Christ was inaugurated into His priestly office. When He was on earth He did not carry on His priestly ministry as He is now doing in the heavens. As our High Priest in the heavens He is qualified to care for us in every detail.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the high priest typifies Christ as our High Priest. Whenever the high priest went into the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, he bore upon his shoulders and upon his breast the names of the children of Israel before God (Exo. 28:9-12, 15-30). Today Christ is our High Priest, and we are on His shoulders and on His breast. He is in the heavens as the High Priest bearing us before God. As Christ bears us before God in the Holy of Holies, He ministers God into our being.</p>
<p>As our High Priest, Christ is taking care of us. He is a &ldquo;merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God&rdquo; (Heb. 2:17), a High Priest who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses (Heb. 4:15).</p>
<p>Christ, our heavenly High Priest, who &ldquo;sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens&rdquo; (Heb. 8:1), is &ldquo;able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, seeing He is always living to intercede for them&rdquo; (Heb. 7:25), caring for all the churches and transmitting into them the heavenly supply.</p>
<p>In Revelation 8 Christ is revealed as the Priest offering the incense at the golden altar: &ldquo;Another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him that He should add it to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne&rdquo; (v. 3). Therefore, Christ is the Priest.</p>
<p>Christ as the High Priest takes care of the lampstands and trims the lamps for the expression of God (Rev. 1:13; 2:1). This work includes His edifying the saints and His building up of the church for a living testimony of Jesus. And in taking care of the lampstands He is also the Priest offering incense to God. To the universe Christ is the Administrator, but to the church He is the High Priest. As the ascended One in the heavens, He is now living, working, and ministering as the High Priest caring for all the saints and all the churches for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p><h2 class="head2">14. A Propitiation-cover (Mercy Seat)</h2>
<p>In ascension Christ is also a propitiation-cover (mercy seat). Romans 3:25 says that God has set forth Christ &ldquo;a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood.&rdquo; The Greek word for propitiation here is <em>hilasterion.</em> This word is different from <em>hilasmos</em> in 1 John 2:2 and 4:10 and <em>hilaskomai</em> in Hebrews 2:17. <em>Hilasmos</em> is that which propitiates, that is, a propitiatory sacrifice. In 1 John 2:2 and 4:10 the Lord Jesus is the propitiatory sacrifice for our sins. <em>Hilaskomai</em> means to appease, to reconcile one by satisfying the other&rsquo;s demand, that is, to propitiate. In Hebrews 2:17 the Lord Jesus makes propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God&rsquo;s righteous demands on us. But <em>hilasterion</em> is the place of propitiation. Therefore, in Hebrews 9:5 this word is used for the cover, the lid, of the ark (translated &ldquo;mercy seat&rdquo; in the King James Version) within the Holy of Holies. In Exodus 25:16-22 and Leviticus 16:12-16 the Septuagint also uses this word for the cover of the ark. The law of the Ten Commandments was in the ark exposing and condemning by its righteous requirements the sin of the people who came to contact God. By the lid of the ark with the atoning blood sprinkled upon it at the day of atonement the whole situation on the sinner&rsquo;s side was fully covered. Hence, it was upon this lid that God could meet with those who broke His righteous law without, governmentally, any contradiction of His righteousness, even under the overshadowing of the cherubim that bore His glory overshadowing the lid of the ark. The propitiatory or expiatory sacrifice, which foreshadowed Christ, satisfied all the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness and glory. As a result, God could pass by the people&rsquo;s sins that occurred at that time. Furthermore, in order to show forth His righteousness, God had to do this. This is what is referred to in Romans 3:25. For this reason, Romans 3:25 uses the word <em>hilasterion</em> to reveal that Christ is the propitiation place, the propitiation-cover, whom God set forth for showing forth His righteousness by passing by the sins of the Old Testament saints, for, as the propitiatory sacrifice, Christ made the full propitiation on the cross for their sins and fully satisfied the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness and glory.</p>
<p>The point we would emphasize here is that in His ascension Christ is the place, the propitiation-cover, for God to meet with us. In Hebrews 4:16 this place is called the throne of grace. The throne of grace is the cover of the ark on which Christ sprinkled the blood He shed on the cross for our redemption. Because of the sprinkling of His redeeming blood, the cover of the ark has become a propitiation-cover, a place where God may contact us and where we may enjoy His grace in full.</p>
<h2 class="head2">15. Minister of the True (Heavenly) Tabernacle</h2>
<p>Hebrews 8:2 says that the ascended Christ is a &ldquo;Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.&rdquo; Christ, as a Minister of the true (heavenly) tabernacle, ministers heaven (which is not only a place but also a condition of life) into us, so that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth as He did while He was here.</p>
<p>The heavenly Christ is ministering in a tabernacle pitched by the Lord and not by man. This tabernacle, this sanctuary, is in the third heaven, in which is the heavenly Holy of Holies. The heavenly Holy of Holies, where Christ is ministering on our behalf, is connected to our spirit. Christ&rsquo;s ministry in the heavens takes care of our need. From the heavens Christ ministers Himself to us as food, as our life supply, in the way of dispensing. As our Minister takes care of our needs, He carries out God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Whatever Christ carries out as the heavenly Minister He applies to us as the Spirit. Whatever He ministers is transmitted into our spirit. Because the Lord in the heavens and the Spirit in our spirit are one, there is a continual transmission between the heavens and our spirit, so that whatever takes place there is immediately applied here.</p>
<p>The supply we need comes from the Christ who is both the Lord in the heavens and the Spirit within us. He is interceding for us, caring for us. Now we may experience Him in all His functions as the ascended One. In particular, as the heavenly Minister He transmits what we need from God the Father, who is the source, into our spirit to supply and sustain us. This is the dispensing of the Triune God into our being.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(12)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall consider Christ in His coming back and in the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">K. IN COMING BACK</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Son of Man</h2>
<p>In His coming back Christ will still be the Son of Man. The Lord&rsquo;s word to the high priest indicates this: &ldquo;Henceforth you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven&rdquo; (Matt. 26:64). In the heavens today the Lord is the Son of Man and He will be the Son of Man even at His coming back on the clouds.</p>
<p>Revelation 14:14 says, &ldquo;I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud One sitting like the Son of Man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.&rdquo; This indicates that when the Lord comes back to reap His harvest on the earth (v. 15), He still will be the Son of Man. At that time He will no longer be wrapped, or concealed, in the clouds (Rev. 10:1), but will be sitting on the cloud. This corresponds to 1 Thessalonians 4:17 and refers to the open aspect of Christ&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>In Matthew 24 the Lord Jesus repeatedly tells His disciples that in His coming back He will be the Son of Man. In verse 27 He says, &ldquo;As the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be.&rdquo; This is the open aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s coming toward the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles. Lightning is concealed in a cloud, waiting for the opportunity to flash forth. Christ will also be clothed with a cloud (Rev. 10:1) in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear like a flash to the earth. By then He still will be the Son of Man.</p>
<p>Matthew 24:30 says, &ldquo;The sign of the Son of Man shall appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the land shall wail, and they shall see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.&rdquo; The sign must be supernatural and clearly visible (perhaps like the lightning in verse 27), appearing in heaven. The tribes refer to the tribes of the nation of Israel, and the land refers to the Holy Land. At the Lord&rsquo;s appearing all the tribes of Israel will repent and wail (Zech. 12:10-14; Rev. 1:7). By this time He will be no longer in the cloud but will be on the cloud with power and great glory, appearing to the people on earth. This is the open aspect of His second coming. Then His power will be exercised to execute God&rsquo;s judgment, to destroy Antichrist with his armies, and to bind Satan for the establishment of His kingdom on earth. The Lord will do all these things as the Son of Man.</p>
<p>In Matthew 24:37, 39, and 44, the Lord goes on to tell us that He will come back as the Son of Man. When He came the first time, He came to be a man through incarnation. When He died on the cross, He was crucified as a man. When He was resurrected, He was resurrected as a man. Furthermore, when He ascended, He ascended as a man, and He is now in the heavens as a man. When He comes back, He will still be the Son of Man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Morning Star to the Overcomers</h2>
<p>In His coming back Christ will be the morning star to the overcomers (Rev. 22:16). In Revelation 2:28 He gives a promise to the overcomer, saying, &ldquo;I will give him the morning star.&rdquo; At Christ&rsquo;s first appearing the wise men, not the Jewish religionists, saw His star (Matt. 2:2, 9-10). At His second appearing He will be the morning star as a reward to His overcomers who watch for His coming. To all others He will appear only as the sun (Mal. 4:2). There is a great difference between the appearing of the morning star and the appearing of the sun. The appearing of the morning star is secret, but the appearing of the sun is open. The Lord promised that if we are watchful and wait for His coming, He will appear to us as the morning star for a reward.</p>
<p>In Revelation 22:16 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright morning star.&rdquo; Christ as the Root and Offspring of David is related to Israel and the kingdom, whereas His being the bright morning star is related to the church and the rapture. The morning star appears before the darkest hour, prior to dawn. The great tribulation will be this darkest hour, after which the day of the kingdom will dawn. In the kingdom the Lord will appear publicly to His people as the sun, but before the great tribulation He will appear privately to His overcomers as the morning star.</p><h2 class="head2">3. The Bridegroom to the Church</h2>
<p>Matthew 25:1 indicates that in His coming back Christ will also be the Bridegroom: &ldquo;Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.&rdquo; We are the virgins going and Christ is the Bridegroom coming.</p>
<p>In the Bible we have a universal couple&mdash;the Bridegroom and the bride. The bride is the aggregate of regenerated persons, and the Bridegroom is Christ with whom all regenerated persons should be one.</p>
<p>The four Gospels reveal that Christ has come as the Bridegroom (Matt. 9:15; Mark 2:19; Luke 5:34; John 3:29). He has come for His bride, and the bride is His increase (John 3:30). In His coming He will come as the Bridegroom for His bride.</p>
<p>As the Bridegroom the Lord Jesus is the most pleasant and attractive person in the whole universe. He is not only God, the Lord, the Master, and the Savior, but He is also the Bridegroom, the most pleasant person. In His coming back He will be such a Bridegroom.</p>
<p>In Revelation 19:7 Christ is unveiled as having a wedding: &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; The reign of God, the kingdom, is related to the marriage of Christ, and the marriage of Christ is the issue of the completion of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age. Then the bride with the overcoming believers will be ready. Hence, in His coming back Christ will be the Bridegroom coming for His bride. According to Revelation 19, He will enjoy a wedding feast.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. The Savior to Israel</h2>
<p>Christ in His coming back will also be the Savior to Israel. Romans 11:26 says, &ldquo;So all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.&rdquo; Because of Israel&rsquo;s unbelief and rejection Christ left them at His going away (Matt. 23:37-39). At the end of the age of grace He will come back to visit them as their Savior, and God will pour upon them the Spirit of grace and supplication; and they will look upon Him whom they have pierced and mourn for Him (Zech. 12:10). Then they all will be saved, as revealed in Romans 11:26.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. A Judge to the Gentiles</h2>
<p>In Acts 17:31 Paul indicates that Christ in His coming back will be a Judge to the Gentiles: &ldquo;He has set a day in which He is about to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a Man whom He has designated.&rdquo; The day set by God for the judgment of the inhabited earth will be the day when Christ will judge the living from the throne of His glory at His coming back before the millennium (Matt. 25:31-46), not including the day when He will judge the dead at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15). According to Acts 10:42, Christ has been designated by God &ldquo;to be the Judge of the living and the dead.&rdquo; He will be the Judge of the dead after the millennium at the great white throne. Second Timothy 4:1 and 1 Peter 4:5 also say that Christ will judge both the living and the dead. The day in Acts 17:31 refers particularly to the day Christ will judge the living, because on this day He will judge &ldquo;the inhabited earth,&rdquo; which should refer only to living men. This day of Christ&rsquo;s judgment on earth will be brought in by His coming back. He has been designated by God to execute this judgment, and God&rsquo;s raising Him from among the dead is strong proof of this. The resurrection of Christ is proof and assurance of His coming back to judge all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
<p>Matthew 25:32 and 33 speak of Christ&rsquo;s judging the Gentiles, the nations: &ldquo;All the nations shall be gathered before Him, and He shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; and He shall set the sheep on His right hand and the goats on the left.&rdquo; The nations here are all the Gentiles who will be left at Christ&rsquo;s coming back to earth after He destroys at Armageddon those Gentiles who follow Antichrist (Rev. 16:14, 16; 19:11-15, 19-21). They will be gathered and judged (Joel 3:2) at Christ&rsquo;s throne of glory. This will be Christ&rsquo;s judgment on the living before the millennium, differing from His judgment on the dead at the great white throne after the millennium. This judgment on the living will occur after His judgment on the believers at His judgment seat in the air (Matt. 25:19-30). In His judging of the nations, Christ will set the sheep on His right hand and the goats on the left. The sheep will be gathered to His right hand, the place of honor (1 Kings 2:19; Psalm 45:9).</p>
<p>The parable of the sheep and the goats in Matthew 25 corresponds to the parable of the net in Matthew 13:47-50. In Matthew 13 there are three kinds of people: the Jews with the kingdom as the treasure hidden in the field; the Gentiles regenerated and transformed into a pearl, the church; and finally, the remaining Gentiles. The Lord will send an angel to collect those who are left in the &ldquo;sea,&rdquo; the Gentile world. The net cast into the sea will bring in every kind of creature without regeneration or transformation. This refers to the Gentiles, the natural people from the corrupted world. The Lord will gather all these before Him and judge them. The good will be gathered into vessels, that is, into the millennial kingdom to be the nations, but the evil will be cast into the furnace of fire. Therefore, at the time of His coming back Christ will judge the living unbelievers at the throne of His glory (Matt. 25:31).</p><h2 class="head2">6. Another Angel to Take Possession of the Earth</h2>
<p>According to Revelation 10:1-7, Christ will come as another Angel to possess the earth. Revelation 10:1 says, &ldquo;I saw another strong Angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon His head, and His face was as the sun, and His feet as pillars of fire.&rdquo; This Angel is Christ, who is coming down out of heaven. At this time He is clothed with a cloud; He is not yet on the cloud, as in Revelation 14:14 and Matthew 24:30; 26:64. To be on the cloud is to come openly, whereas to be clothed with a cloud is to come secretly. In Revelation 10:1 Christ is still coming secretly, not openly.</p>
<p>As the Angel coming to possess the earth, Christ has a rainbow upon His head. Here the rainbow indicates that Christ in His judgment on the earth and in His coming to take possession of it will keep the covenant God made with Noah concerning the earth (Gen. 9:8-17). It also indicates that He is the One who will execute judgment according to the One sitting on the throne with the rainbow round about it (Rev. 4:2-3).</p>
<p>We are also told in Revelation 10:1 that as another strong Angel Christ&rsquo;s face is as the sun, and His feet are as pillars of fire. Here, close to the time of His coming to the earth openly, He will not be like the morning star, which appears before the darkest time prior to dawn. Here pillars indicate steadfastness (Jer. 1:18; Gal. 2:9), and fire, the holiness of God (Exo. 19:18; Heb. 12:29), according to which Christ will execute His judgment upon the earth.</p>
<p>Revelation 10:2 goes on to say that in His coming to possess the earth Christ will place &ldquo;His right foot on the sea and the left on the land.&rdquo; To place His feet on the sea and on the land is to tread on them, and this means to take possession of them (Deut. 11:24; Josh. 1:3; Psa. 8:6). This indicates that Christ is coming down to take possession of the earth. Only He is qualified to possess the earth.</p>
<p>In the book of Joshua God told the people that they would possess whatever part of the land the sole of their foot would tread upon. They were to walk through the land, and wherever they set their feet, that would be their possession. Based on the same principle, Christ, as another Angel sent by God, will tread upon the sea and the land, for the earth and the sea have both been given to Him as His inheritance (Psa. 2:8). Although the earth and the sea have been usurped by His enemy, one day He will tolerate this usurpation no longer. He will come to claim His rightful inheritance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">L. IN THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>Let us now go on to see Christ&rsquo;s person in the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Son of Man</h2>
<p>In the kingdom Christ will be the Son of Man. Matthew 13:41 says, &ldquo;The Son of Man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all stumblingblocks and those who do lawlessness.&rdquo; After Christ comes back, He will set up the kingdom of God on earth. Then in the kingdom He will still be the Son of Man.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, rebelled against God&rsquo;s authority (Isa. 14:13-14). For dealing with him God created man and gave man dominion to rule over the earth (Gen. 1:26). After man was seduced by Satan to follow him (Gen. 3:1-6), God became a man by the name Jesus to undo the works of the Devil (1 John 3:8) and destroy him (Heb. 2:14), that He might reclaim the earth to be His kingdom (Rev. 11:15; 12:10). In this upcoming kingdom, which Christ as the Son of Man will bring in (Dan. 7:13-14; Luke 19:12-15), He will surely be the Son of Man, not only as a sign of God&rsquo;s victory and glory but also as a sign of Satan&rsquo;s defeat and shame.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The King</h2>
<p>After Christ takes possession of the earth, He will reign over the earth as the King in the kingdom, ruling over the nations with His overcoming believers (Rev. 20:4, 6; 2:26-27). As the coming King He will be the Head and the center in the upcoming kingdom of God in the millennium. This will be the fulfillment of Isaiah 32:1, Jeremiah 23:5, and Zechariah 14:9, 17. As Christ has redeemed the earth and all its peoples (Col. 1:20) to the sphere and components of His kingdom, as He has sold all to buy the kingdom (Matt. 13:44), and as He has rescued the earth with all its peoples from the usurpation of Satan (Rev. 20:2-3), He will have the full right to be the King of the restored earth and the restored nations. In His upcoming reign God&rsquo;s authority and glory will be fully manifested (Matt. 6:13), and the whole earth with its peoples will be brought into righteousness, peace, joy, and the full blessing of God&rsquo;s creation (Isa. 32:1, 16-18; 35:1-2, 5-7).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(13)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall consider Christ&rsquo;s person in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">M. IN THE NEW JERUSALEM&mdash;IN ETERNITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Lamb</h2>
<p>In the New Jerusalem Christ will still be the redeeming Lamb (Rev. 22:1). This indicates that in eternity we shall be enjoying what God has prepared for us through Christ as the Lamb. Christ accomplished redemption on earth. This redemption was designed by God in eternity past. Before the foundation of the world Christ was appointed by God to be the Lamb to redeem the fallen human race (1 Pet. 1:19-20). Hence, redemption was designed in eternity and accomplished in time. The fact that Christ will be the Lamb in the New Jerusalem means that the redemption accomplished by Him in time will be carried into eternity. In eternity past there was only the design of redemption, but in eternity future there will be a memorial of redemption. In the New Jerusalem we shall remember that we were fallen and that we were redeemed by Christ as the Lamb.</p>
<p>In eternity we shall enjoy something like the Lord&rsquo;s table. When Christ established the table, He said, &ldquo;I will by no means drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father&rdquo; (Matt. 26:29). Here we see that we shall have the Lord&rsquo;s table in the kingdom. In the New Jerusalem we shall have the Lord&rsquo;s table eternally. We shall remember how Christ gave His body for us so that we might become His mystical Body, and how He shed His blood for our sins so that we might be redeemed back to God and have the right to come to Him and enjoy Him as the tree of life. There will be such a memorial in eternity. For this reason, Christ will be the Lamb in the New Jerusalem. He was appointed the Lamb in eternity past, He died as the Lamb in time, and in eternity He will still be the Lamb for a memorial.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Husband</h2>
<p>In eternity Christ, the Lamb, will be the Husband. This means that the Redeemer is the Husband and that the New Jerusalem is the wife. The thousand years of the millennium will be the Lamb&rsquo;s wedding day (Rev. 19:7). On this wedding day the overcoming saints will be the bride to the Bridegroom. Then after the wedding day Christ for eternity will live a married life with His redeemed ones. In that married life He will be the eternal Husband, and all His redeemed ones will be His eternal wife.</p>
<p>In both the Old and New Testaments God likens His chosen people to His spouse (Isa. 54:6; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:31-32). The spouse is for the Lord&rsquo;s satisfaction in love. As the bride of Christ, New Jerusalem comes out of Christ, her Husband, and becomes His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam, her husband, and became his counterpart (Gen. 2:21-24). As the wife of Christ, the New Jerusalem is prepared by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ.</p>
<p>Revelation 21:9 speaks of both the bride and the wife. The bride is mainly for the wedding day, whereas the wife is for the entire life. The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium for one thousand years as one day (2 Pet. 3:8) and the wife in the new heaven and the new earth for eternity. The bride in the kingdom age will include the overcomers (Rev. 3:12; 19:7-9), but the wife in eternity will include all God&rsquo;s redeemed ones.</p>
<p>In the book of Genesis Adam typifies Christ as the Husband, and Eve typifies the church as the wife. Eve was built with a bone, a rib, taken out of Adam and then was brought back to Adam to be one flesh with him. The ultimate fulfillment of this type will be in the New Jerusalem. Christ will be the eternal Adam, and God&rsquo;s redeemed people will be the eternal Eve. The two, Christ and His wife, will enjoy their married life eternally.</p><h2 class="head2">3. The Temple</h2>
<p>In eternity Christ with God will also be the temple (Rev. 21:22). According to the Bible, the temple is where God dwells and where His people worship Him. In eternity Christ with God will be such a temple, a temple that is both God&rsquo;s habitation and our dwelling place.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21:3 we see that the New Jerusalem, as God&rsquo;s dwelling place, will be the tabernacle of God with men for eternity. The tabernacle made by Moses was a type (Exo. 25:8-9; Lev. 26:11). That type was first fulfilled in Christ as God&rsquo;s tabernacle among men (John 1:14), and will eventually be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem, which will be the enlargement of Christ as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This tabernacle will also be the eternal dwelling place of God&rsquo;s redeemed people. Hence, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for both God and us.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21 firstly is the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle, then is Christ with God as the temple. The New Jerusalem is a composition of all of God&rsquo;s redeemed people, both the redeemed of Israel and the redeemed church. It consists of God&rsquo;s redeemed people as a tabernacle for God&rsquo;s dwelling place. In the Old Testament the tabernacle of God was a precursor of the temple of God. The New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God will be the temple of God. This indicates that in the new heaven and the new earth the temple of God will be enlarged into a city. In one sense the holy city as composed of God&rsquo;s redeemed people to be the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and in another sense the holy city as constituted of Christ with God to be the temple is for us to dwell in. Therefore, in the new heaven and the new earth the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for both God and man for eternity. Actually, the tabernacle and the temple signify one thing&mdash;the mutual dwelling place of God and His redeemed people. The tabernacle signifies God&rsquo;s redeemed people, and the temple signifies Christ with God. These are not two separate things but one thing in two aspects. This indicates that God&rsquo;s redeemed people and Christ with God are not two separate entities but one corporate entity in two aspects.</p>
<p>In eternity the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle to God and Christ with God as the temple to us will both be for God to dwell among His redeemed people that He may dispense Himself into them. The New Jerusalem will be a gathering of all of God&rsquo;s redeemed people so that God may have a dwelling place in which to dispense Himself in Christ into them continually for eternity, and that they may eat and drink of the all-inclusive Triune God for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. The Lamp</h2>
<p>In the New Jerusalem Christ will not only be the Lamb, the Husband, and the temple; He will also be the lamp. Revelation 21:23 says, &ldquo;The city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.&rdquo; Christ is the Lamb to be the lamp. As the lamp, Christ shines out God for eternity. God is light (1 John 1:5), and this light is in the lamp shining forth the Triune God as light into the redeemed ones. This also is a matter of God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<p>In eternity the Lamb as the lamp will shine with God as the light to illuminate the New Jerusalem with the glory of God, which glory is the expression of the divine light. God as the light, and Christ as the lamp, the light-bearer, indicate that God and Christ cannot be separated. Actually they are one light. God is the content, and Christ is the light-bearer for the expression of God. As the light is in the lamp to be its content and to be expressed through the lamp, so God the Father is in the Son to be expressed through the Son.</p>
<p>God, being the light, needs a lamp. Without the Lamb being the lamp, God&rsquo;s shining over us would &ldquo;kill&rdquo; us. With the redeeming Christ as the lamp, however, the divine light does not kill us; rather, it illumines us. First Timothy 6:16 says God dwells in unapproachable light. In Christ, though, God becomes approachable. Outside of Christ God&rsquo;s shining would be a killing, but inside of Christ God&rsquo;s shining is an illumining. Because the divine light shines through the Redeemer, this light has become lovable and touchable, and we may even walk in it (1 John 1:7). Through the redeeming One, the Lamb, God&rsquo;s killing light becomes an enjoyable shining for God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<p>Revelation 21:23 is a clear picture of the centrality and universality of Christ. God is the light, Christ, the Lamb, is the lamp, and the New Jerusalem is the container of this lamp. God shines in and through Christ, and Christ shines in and through the New Jerusalem. By this, Christ will be the centrality and universality of the coming eternity, when Christ will be the center, the circumference, and everything in the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head2">5. The Spring of the Water of Life</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:6 indicates that in the New Jerusalem Christ will be the spring of the water of life: &ldquo;I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.&rdquo; Here we have the spring of the water of life, and in Revelation 22:1, the river of water of life. The water of life is the Triune God Himself as life to us. This water of life first has a spring and then a flow, a river. The flow comes from the spring, and the spring comes from the fountain. The fountain is the Father, the spring is the Son, and the flow, the river, is the Spirit. In eternity Christ will be the spring of the water of life, even as the Spirit will be the river and the Father will be the fountain.</p>
<p>As we consider the fountain, the spring, and the river, we see a picture of the Triune God flowing out as the water of life to dispense Himself into His redeemed people. According to the picture portrayed in Revelation 21 and 22, the river of water of life will flow in a spiral manner throughout the New Jerusalem and saturate the entire city. This is God&rsquo;s marvelous dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. The Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Revelation 22:2 says, &ldquo;On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; In the New Jerusalem Christ will be the tree of life. The word for &ldquo;tree&rdquo; as in Revelation 2:7 and 1 Peter 2:24, is &ldquo;wood&rdquo; in Greek, not the usual word used for tree. In the Bible &ldquo;the tree of life&rdquo; refers to Christ as the embodiment of all the riches of God (Col. 2:9) for our food (Gen. 2:9; 3:22, 24; Rev. 22:14, 19). Here it refers to the crucified (implied in the tree as a piece of wood&mdash;1 Pet. 2:24) and resurrected (implied in the <em>zoe</em> life&mdash;John 11:25) Christ who is in the church life today, the consummation of which will be the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem the crucified and resurrected Christ will be the tree of life for the nourishment of all God&rsquo;s redeemed people for eternity.</p>
<p>It was God&rsquo;s original intention that man should eat of the tree of life (Gen. 2:9, 16). Due to the fall, the tree of life was closed to man (Gen. 3:22-24). Through the redemption of Christ the way to touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, has been opened again (Heb. 10:19-20). The eating of the tree of life not only was God&rsquo;s original intention concerning man, but this will also be the eternal issue of God&rsquo;s redemption. All His redeemed people will enjoy the tree of life, which is Christ with all the divine riches as their eternal portion, for eternity.</p>
<p>According to Revelation 22:2, the tree of life grows &ldquo;on this side and on that side of the river.&rdquo; The one tree of life growing on the two sides of the river signifies that the tree of life is a vine, spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life for God&rsquo;s people to receive and enjoy. It fulfills, for eternity, what God intended from the beginning. Today the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life is the believers&rsquo; common portion (John 6:35, 57). In the millennial kingdom the overcoming believers will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their reward (Rev. 2:7). Eventually, in the new heaven and the new earth, for eternity, all God&rsquo;s redeemed will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their eternal portion.</p>
<p>The tree of life is Christ as our life supply. First Christ is the Lamb of God for our redemption (John 1:29) and then the tree of life for our life supply. He is not only the redeeming Lamb of God but also the tree of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The leaves&rdquo; of the tree of life are &ldquo;for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; In the Bible, leaves are a symbol of man&rsquo;s deeds (Gen. 3:7). The leaves of the tree of life symbolize the deeds of Christ. The regenerated believers eat the fruit of the tree of life, receiving Christ as their life and life supply inwardly, that they may enjoy the divine life for eternity; whereas the restored nations are healed by the leaves of the tree of life, taking the deeds of Christ as their guide and regulation outwardly, that they may live the human life forever. As the tree of life, Christ sustains the regenerated sons of God with Himself as the life supply, and maintains the restored peoples of nations with His deeds as the healing element, in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. The Son of Man</h2>
<p>In the New Jerusalem Christ will still be the Son of Man eternally. John 1:51 indicates this: &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo; In eternity future Christ will be not only God but also man, not only the Son of God but also the Son of Man. In eternity past He was God, solely and merely divine, having no humanity. But in eternity future He will be God and man, the Son of God and the Son of Man, both divine and human, having divinity as well as humanity. In eternity He will have two natures, two essences, and two substances&mdash;divinity and humanity. Eternally Christ will be the Son of Man to be the Lamb, the Husband, the temple, the lamp, the spring of water of life, and the tree of life. In eternity future Christ will have both divinity and humanity forever.</p>
<h2 class="head2">8. The Shepherd</h2>
<p>In eternity Christ will not only be the Lamb, the Husband, the temple, the lamp, the spring of the water of life, the tree of life, and the Son of Man&mdash;He will also be the Shepherd. In eternity we shall not have problems, but we shall still need Christ&rsquo;s shepherding. A good shepherd not only solves the problems of the sheep but also feeds them. In fact, the most important task of a shepherd is the feeding of the sheep. Likewise, in the New Jerusalem our Shepherd, Christ, will feed us.</p>
<p>Concerning Christ&rsquo;s eternal shepherding, Revelation 7:17 says, &ldquo;The Lamb in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them and shall guide them to springs of waters of life.&rdquo; As our Shepherd Christ will lead us to the springs of the waters of life. This indicates that He will shepherd us into Himself. He will lead us into Himself as the spring of the water of life so that we may enjoy the eternal dispensing of the Triune God, that we may express Him to the fullest extent for eternity.</p></body></html>
