   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 11:"And He said to them, Not all men can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The amount that one can receive depends on the capacity one has.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No one can compel another not to marry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To compel others to divorce is sin, and to compel others not to marry also is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Not all men can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, the Lord unveiled God's original purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the other hand, He also unveiled the fact that God is able to raise up certain ones who would not marry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 12:"For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He who can accept it, let him accept it."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"He who can accept it."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are three types of people who can accept it: 1 those born eunuchs those who are physiologically handicapped; 2 those made eunuchs by man those who became such through circumstances or punishment; and 3 those who are eunuchs "because of the kingdom of the heavens," the apostle Paul being one such example.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He refrained from marriage for the sake of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If he had married, God's work would surely have been affected.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who "made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens" have special positions in the kingdom of the heavens see Rev 14:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to avoid misunderstanding, the Lord said, "He who can accept it, let him accept it."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This became a special privilege to encourage those who "made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 13-15:"Then little children were brought to Him that He might lay His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But Jesus said, Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And after He laid His hands on them, He went on from there."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These three verses tell us that no person should consider himself so great as to find anything too small for him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The disciples thought that the Lord was the Rabbi of the rabbis and that He ought not to do such a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The disciples prevented the little children because they were impatient with them and because they tried to assume the position as disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord told them to allow the little children to come to Him because: 1 Every great person can do the smallest thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, brothers should sweep the floor, clean the windows, and do such things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2 In the kingdom of the heavens, everyone is like a little child.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This does not mean that one is a child, but that he has the innocence, the humility, and the dependence of a child.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3 Children have souls also, and we should love them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>4 The love of God can be manifested in the smallest matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"He went on from there."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The opportunity was not always available because the Lord was going on.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a man misses the opportunity to receive grace, there is really no way to regain it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is most pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, accept the Lord's salvation while it is the time of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although the door of grace is open now, one day it will be closed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why one should never miss the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every time the Lord departed, there were always sick people and sinners who were left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 16:"And behold, someone came to Him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verses 16-30 are difficult to expound.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The other Gospels mention a ruler of the Jews Luke 18:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This title implies that the young man was in a good position.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For a long time the young man had heard of the Lord's name and had sought after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He already had quite an amount of knowledge because 1 he knew that one should have eternal life; 2 he did not have eternal life; 3 he knew that by doing good, one could secure eternal life; and 4 he did not know what kind of good he should do to gain eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This young man did not ask whether or not there was eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was not pursuing the worldly pleasure but was seeking the pleasure of the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 17:"And He said to him, Why do you ask Me concerning what is good?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is only One who is good.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord answered the young man according to his background and his real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This does not mean that the Lord admitted that good works can secure eternal life for a person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a man assumes that by doing good he can be saved, and he comes to seek the words of eternal life, the most natural way to answer him would be, "Why not do good then?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This would make him realize the failure and the unreliability of doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"There is only One who is good."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nothing else is good, because only One is good.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Surely, "He who does them shall live because of them" Gal 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Unfortunately, there is none who is justified before God by keeping the law Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is because by trespassing against one of the smallest commandments, one is guilty of trespassing against the whole law James 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, Paul said that the law was originally ordained to be the ministry of the Lord, but it had become the ministry of death 2 Cor 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As the dumb cannot ask how to sing in order to please God and the lame cannot ask how to dance in order to be welcomed by man, so also man cannot ask how to do good in order to gain eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The sinners today also like to ask how to do good in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Verses 18-19:"He said to Him, Which ones?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And Jesus said, You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness; honor your father and mother; and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The young man thought that there were a great many commandments, and he did not know which one the Lord was talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, he asked which commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those that the Lord indicated were all from the second tablet, that is, from the fifth to the tenth commandments; they speak of one's responsibilities before man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The first tablet, which comprises the first to the fourth commandments, speak of one's responsibilities before God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Jewish people all thought that they had closely followed the commandments on the first tablet.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, the Lord asked him about the second tablet.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If he could be clear before man, then perhaps he could also be upright before God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Verse 20:"The young man said to Him, All these things I have kept.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What do I still lack?"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"All these things I have kept."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord mentioned the commandments with the hope that the young man would say that he had not kept them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Yet the young man said that he had kept all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Here the Lord still could not make him recognize God or Himself.</S>
