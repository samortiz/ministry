   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous meetings we have seen that man has sinned and that God's salvation is based on the fact that man has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If man had not sinned, there would be no need for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since man has sinned, God has given the law to show man that he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's law came to the world to cause man's transgressions to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Originally, man had only sin; he did not have transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when the law came, man had not only sin, but transgressions as well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After man transgresses, he realizes that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank the Lord that though we have sin and though we have transgressed, God, who is love, purposed to give us grace and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He purposed to do something for us to solve the problems that we cannot solve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this meeting, however, we must see something else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although God loves us and shows mercy on us and although He fully intends to grant us grace, there is one thing that makes it very difficult for God to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God cannot bestow grace upon us immediately; He cannot give us eternal life directly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a dilemma which God must solve before He can grant grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The problem, which the Bible mentions frequently, is God's own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The phrase God's righteousness has confused many theologians for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we read the Bible without prejudice and preconceived notions, God will show us what His righteousness is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can see this matter clearly without much difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Tonight we hope to see, by the grace of God, what God's righteousness is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, we hope to see the difficulty God encounters when He saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>HIS SALVATION MATCHING HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If God is to save us, He must save us to a condition that matches, or measures up to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If God is to give us salvation, He cannot give it in a manner that conflicts with His nature, His method, and His way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are sinners full of transgressions and, therefore, have no thought of righteousness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we wanted to be saved, we would probably use any means possible, whether straight or crooked, good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We would try to be saved by any of a thousand and one ways.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as we can be saved in some way, it is good enough for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not care if the procedure is proper or if the method is right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as we are saved, we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We could not care less from where the salvation comes, and whether or not it is right.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this sense, we are like thieves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All that a thief cares about is getting the money.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He does not care where the money comes from.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as he gets the money, he is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has no concept of right and wrong; he has no concept of righteousness and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we must realize that salvation is not just a matter of us getting saved, but of God saving us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although we would be satisfied no matter how we are saved, God cannot say that all there is to salvation is getting us saved, without caring about whether the way we are saved is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God undoubtedly desires to give us grace and to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without doubt, He wants to give us His life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is full of love, and He is more than willing for us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if God is to save us, He has to save us in an excelling way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, God's saving us is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God desires to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But what method can He use so that man can be saved in a most righteous way?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What method is most reasonable?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What method will match His own dignity?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is easy to be saved, but it is difficult to be saved righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is why the Bible speaks so much about God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It tells us again and again that God saves man in a way that matches His own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is God's righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's righteousness is God's way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Love is God's nature, holiness is God's disposition, and glory is God's own being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Righteousness, however, is God's procedure, His way, and His method.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since God is righteous, He cannot love man merely according to His own love.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He cannot grant man grace merely according to what He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He cannot save man merely according to His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is true that God saves man because He loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But He must do so in a way that is in agreement with His own righteousness, His own procedure, His own moral standard, His own way, His own method, His own dignity, and His own majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We know that it is easy for God to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But it is not easy for God to save man in a righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Just imagine how easy it would be for God to save us if the matter of righteousness were not a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There would be no difficulty at all.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If God had not loved us, nothing could be done for us and everything would be hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But God has loved us and has had mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Furthermore, He intends to give us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the issue of righteousness had not come in, God could say, "Have you sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All right, just do not commit the mistake again."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God could then overlook our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He could let us go and send us away.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If God forgives carelessly not judging the sinner's sin and dealing with his sins according to the law, where is His righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Here is where the difficulty lies.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some time ago, a brother got caught up in a complicated matter and was put in jail by the government.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I knew that though he was not completely without fault, the mistake was really with other people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Because of this, I was willing to help him out.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I went to Nanking and talked to a few of the people who were involved in the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I told them about the situation and asked if they could help out a little.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There were nine of us there, and all of us were busy people.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We held nine meetings together over a period of eleven days, trying to come up with a way to help this man.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Eventually, all these people admitted that they had the way and the authority to release the man, but that they could not release him without incriminating themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, we had to find a way to release the man that, at the same time, would be legal.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Undoubtedly, God is full of love for us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God wants to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But He must do so legally.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If He does not save us legally, He cannot save us at all.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God's love is limited by His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God cannot act contrary to Himself and irresponsibly declare that our sins are written off, that everything is fine, and that we can get off free.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If God were to forgive us irresponsibly, what law, what righteousness, and what truth would be left in the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All of these would be through.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God wants to save us, and we need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The question is whether or not there will be unrighteousness in our being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>There are many today who accept bribes from others and are partial because of private relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They often help others out, and others often receive benefits from them; but we all agree that these people are not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They are not righteous but corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They may have much love, but what they do is not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God cannot save us at the expense of involving Himself in unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God must save us while preserving His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is important for God to save us, but He must do so according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God could save us immediately with His love.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But He must also save us very righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>How can this be done?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It is not an easy matter for God to save us without violating His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>How can God justify sinners without getting into unrighteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>How can God save sinners without involving Himself in unrighteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>How can God forgive sins in a righteous way?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>God is willing to save us, but He wants us to be able to say, at the time we receive His life and are saved, that He has justified us in a most righteous way.</S>
