   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT OUR MUTUAL ABIDING WITH GOD Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:6, 28; 3:24; 4:4, 13, 15, 16; John 14:23; 15:4-5; Eph 3:17 MYSTERIOUS WRITINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All John's writings are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His Gospel, for example, begins: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This sentence is simple, but its meaning is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the beginning?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is meant by the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can the Word be with God yet also be God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 1:14 John says that the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Word is high and glorious; the flesh, low and mean.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet the Word became flesh!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we come to John's Epistles, we find in these few chapters mystery after mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the opening verses of 1 John we have life declared to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who can define life?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even physical life is hard to define.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John is referring to the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What does eternal mean?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever it means, this eternal life has been declared, even ministered, to us, and we have received it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fellowship is another mysterious term John uses in his first Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How short of utterance we are when it comes to explaining what fellowship is!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Fellowship is not merely shaking hands.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It does not mean simply associating and meeting with like-minded people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It does not mean merely talking together or showing affection for others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These may be indications of a fraternal relationship or of friendship, but fellowship is not that superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is hard to define.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abiding is another term John uses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To abide does not mean merely to have a close relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However close a relationship we may have with someone, we cannot abide in that person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible in John's writings nonetheless tells us repeatedly and emphatically that we are to abide in Christ and have Him abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In both the Gospel of John and in his first Epistle, he stresses this mutual abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can we abide in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1 John the abiding is in God 4:15-16 ; in the Gospel the abiding is in Christ 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here is a strong proof that Jesus Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To abide in Christ is to abide in God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To abide in God is to abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The actual meaning of having God abide in us and us abide in Him is beyond our ability to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many things we participate in and enjoy but cannot define.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This mutual abiding is one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I would first like to amplify what I said in the previous message about fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us use the illustration that John uses in chapter fifteen of his Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He says that the Lord Jesus is the vine and that we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are His branches, but this is not true of us naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the fact and according to the revelation of the Bible, we are not naturally His branches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We were branches of the wild tree see Rom 11:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is through redemption and regeneration that we wild, sinful branches have been grafted into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This vine is under the cultivation of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is the Husbandman who has planted and is caring for this vine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here, then, are two entities: the cultivated vine and the formerly wild branches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What happens when they are grafted together?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By the life flowing within them, they become one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This life is not motionless.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It flows, grows, and develops.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the life within moves, it is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To live Christ by fellowship is not merely to listen to His voice and obey His word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not bring this thought into the matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Fellowship is not a question of listening to His voice or of obeying His word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may use such terms, but that is an inaccurate way of describing the fellowship between Him and us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No actual words are spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No words are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The flowing life within us has brought us into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The tree and the branch are no longer separated from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By the inner, flowing life they have been made one.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He who is joined to the Lord is one Spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The most intimate relationship in human life is marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our relationship with the Lord Jesus, however, is deeper than even the closest bond between husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A couple needs to talk matters over and make decisions because they are two separate people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord Jesus, however, lives within us; the two of us are one.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The life we share in common has made us one.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We two have become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Fellowship is the life moving within to bring two entities into one.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The branch and the vine are no longer distinct from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By the flowing, growing, and developing of the inner life these two, which formerly were separate, become one.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When I grow, He grows.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is not to say that there is both my growth and His.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He grows in my growth; my growth is His growth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The relationship of husband and wife is not this close.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There are two people involved.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>One may want to go somewhere, and the other may feel like staying home.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Even if they go together or stay home together, there are still two people acting.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They may do something together, yet they are two.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>With the vine and the branch, we have not a couple but a single entity.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Does the vine tell the branch to listen to its voice? to obey what it says? to grow along with it?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>How foolish!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There is no need of speaking and no need of listening.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Apparently the New Testament teaches that we need to imitate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have been taught that we must improve our behavior according to His pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Christ is our example; we must follow in His steps.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But actually what the New Testament teaches is that we must live Christ by the fellowship of Him in life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is not an effort to improve our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is to live Him by the inner fellowship that comes out of this moving life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When this life moves in us, there is a current; we are to live Him by this current, which is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>How different this is from merely imitating Christ!</S>
