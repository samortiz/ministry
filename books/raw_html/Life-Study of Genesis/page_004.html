<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE BIBLE</H2><P>In addition, we have some verses which tell us that the Bible has many other functions. The Bible has the wisdom which can help us to be saved (2 Tim. 3:15). It has the producing function of a seed. Through the Word of the Bible we can be reborn, regenerated (1 Pet. 1:23). After the new birth, the Word of the Bible is milk and food to us that we may be nourished to grow in the Lord (1 Pet. 2:2; Matt. 4:4). So, we must eat the Word (Jer. 15:16), that is, take the Word into us by exercising our spirit over the Word.</P><P>Also, the Bible can give us the best teaching and perfect the man of God (Rom. 15:4; 2 Tim. 3:16-17). If we belong to the Lord and desire to be perfect, we can surely receive perfection through His divine Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><P>The Bible is composed of two Testaments, the Old and the New. The Old Testament is mainly a prediction of Christ, predicting the coming Christ in plain words, shadows, types, and many figures.</P><P>The Lord Jesus in Luke 24 twice tells us that the Old Testament was written concerning Him (vv. 27, 44). The Old Testament can be subdivided into three main sections: Moses (which means the law), the prophets, and the psalms. The Lord said that in every section of the Old Testament there is something written concerning Him. In John 5:39 the Lord also says that the scriptures of the Old Testament are a testimony of Him. And in Hebrews 10:7 He said, "In the roll of the book [that is, the Old Testament] it is written concerning Me." Thus, the Old Testament is mainly a record prophesying of Christ as everything to the people of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GENESIS</H2><P>Now we may begin a life-study of Genesis. The original title of this book was "In [the] Beginning." The Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, adopted the title of Genesis which is a Latin word that means giving of birth, origin. Genesis brings birth to everything, gives the origin of everything. Genesis is a book containing all the seeds of the divine truths. All the divine truths in the whole Bible were sown in this book.</P>
