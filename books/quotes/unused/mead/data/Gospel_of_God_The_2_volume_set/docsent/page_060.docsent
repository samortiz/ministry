   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE APPLICATIONS OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should now ask, how is God's righteousness applied to us?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's righteousness is applied to us in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's righteousness can first be applied in its giving us peace in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Feelings are unreliable; therefore, we may not trust God's feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Love is likewise unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If someone's love changes, no one can penalize him or her for it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we can lay hold of righteousness and make claims based on righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God only loves us, He may spare us from the judgment of sins or may let us off easily, if that is something that He can do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But what if one day God is not happy with us anymore and does not want to go easy on us anymore?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If God does not love us anymore and if He becomes angry and unhappy with us, we would suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Under such circumstances, we could not have any assurance about God, and our hearts would never be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But now that God has given us His righteousness, we are at peace, for we know that our sins have been judged in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, we can have a bold conscience and definite assurance when we come to God, and our heart can have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peace cannot be obtained through love; peace can only be obtained through righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although in reality God's love is reliable, from man's point of view it is not as reliable as God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a person first begins to trust in God, he should learn to trust more in His righteousness than in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later, as he progresses, he should learn to trust more in God's love than in His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a trust belongs to an advanced stage of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the life of people like Madame Guyon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But at the beginning, we should take righteousness as the basis of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without righteousness, faith has no basis.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thank God that our sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thank Him that He will never judge us anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the hymn says:</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God would not have His claim on two,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First on His Son, my Surety true,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And then upon me laid.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our hearts are at rest, for our sins have been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's righteousness has another application: It causes us to realize the loathsome nature of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to preserve His righteousness, God was willing even to crucify His Son on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God would rather sacrifice His Son than sacrifice His righteousness, His truth, and His law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God would not do one thing that is contrary to His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we can see how loathsome sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If God cannot be careless about sin and would rather judge His Son in order to deal with sin, we also cannot be careless toward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In God's view, His Son can be sacrificed, but sin cannot be left undealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every believer in the Lord Jesus must see then that no sin can be glossed over.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's attitude toward sin is very strict.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now all our sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus has died, we are forgiven, and everything is taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here I would like to give you one more illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One day I was at Hsiao-feng Park reading my Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suddenly, the sky blackened and thunder began to roll.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It looked as if it was going to rain immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I closed my Bible quickly and ran to a little house behind the park.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But after a while the rain had not yet come, so I walked home hurriedly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the way home the sky was still quite dark; thunder was rolling, and the clouds were very thick.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet the rain did not come not one drop fell on me the entire way home.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On another occasion some time later, I went to the same park to read again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This time also the sky blackened like the previous time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thunder started to roll again, and the clouds were overcast and thick.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I counted on my experience from the last time, so I was quite at ease and moved slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But unfortunately this time the rain came, and I got wet.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I had no choice but to run to that little house again.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By the time I reached the house, the rain was pouring down.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I did not know how heavy the rain was.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But, eventually, the sky cleared, the clouds dispersed, the thunder ceased, and I walked home again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This time, like the previous time, there was not a drop of rain while I was on my way home.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But let me ask you a question: On which occasion did my heart have more peace?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On both occasions no rain fell on me as I walked home.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But which time did I have more peace?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Was it the first time, or was it the second time?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although the first time there was no rain on the way home, I did not know when the rain would come; as a result, my heart was held in suspense.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the second occasion there was also no rain on the way home, but my heart was at peace because the rain had already passed and the sky was clear.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many people hope that God's grace would gloss over their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They are like I was on my first trip home.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although there is no rain, darkness still hangs overhead; thunder still rolls and the clouds still cover.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Their hearts are still held in suspense.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They do not know what will happen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But praise and thank the Lord, the salvation we have received is one that has already "passed through the rain."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is a salvation that has "passed through thunder."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our "rain" has already been poured out on Calvary, and our "thunder" has already rolled on Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now everything is over.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We rejoice not only because our sins have been forgiven, but because they have been forgiven after being dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They were not glossed over.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God has dealt with the problem of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>His Son's resurrection has become the evidence of this work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today is the day of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But we must remember that grace reigns through righteousness Rom 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Grace cannot come directly; it must come through righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God's grace does not come to us directly.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It comes to us through Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Today some say that if God loves us, He can forgive us without judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>That would be grace reigning without righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But grace is reigning through righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Grace needs the righteousness of Calvary before it can reign.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Today our receiving of grace is based solely upon God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Our sins are forgiven after they are dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When we see the cross, it is right to say that this is God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is also right to say that this is God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The cross signifies God's righteousness, and it also signifies God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>To God, the cross is righteousness; to us, it is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When we behold the cross today, our heart is fully at rest because we know that the grace that we have received was obtained through God's righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We know that our salvation is clear, complete, proper, and upright.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Our salvation does not come through smuggling and fraud.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Rather, it comes through judgment on sin.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The cross has solved the problem of sin, and the resurrection has confirmed that the solution is indeed true.</S>
