THE BODY AND COUNTERPART OF CHRIST<br />
TO EXPRESS THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1 says that the church is the Body of Christ and that the Body is the fullness of Christ (vv. 22-23). If a brother stands up, and I cover his body so that people can see only his head, his fullness will not be expressed, because his body is his fullness. Once his body is covered, his fullness is not expressed. The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. The church is the Body of Christ and also His fullness. When we touch the riches of Christ, there is an issue, and that issue is the producing of the church. Without the church, Christ has no fullness; and without the church, Christ has only a head but no body. Without the church, Christ has no counterpart. He is like an Adam without an Eve.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2:18 God said, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart&rdquo; In verses 21 and 22 God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and He took one of his ribs and built the rib, which He had taken from the man, into a woman. God did not create another human being apart from Adam. Rather, God built the rib that He had taken from Adam into Eve. Hence, Eve is the enlargement of Adam to be his counterpart and to become his fullness. Likewise, although the Ark is complete in itself, without the tabernacle the fullness of the Ark is not seen; without the tabernacle the Ark has no expression. Christ is complete in Himself and has God as His rich content, but without the church, without His counterpart, He does not have an expression of fullness. God is doing one work in the universe, which is to gain an organic entity to match His Son. This work is to produce the fullness of His Son so that the riches of His Son may be expressed. Just as the tabernacle matches the Ark, and Eve matches Adam, so the church must match Christ. There must be a Body that matches the Head. Only in this way can the fullness of Christ be expressed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Body of Christ<br />
Being the Enlargement of Christ</h2>
<p>God wants to build the church, the Body of Christ, and this Body is the enlargement of Christ. We need to understand these two points: our work is to dispense the riches of Christ into the saints, and we allow these riches to build the Body in order for Christ to have an enlarged expression. The riches become the enlargement of Christ. When He is enlarged, we are built together with others to be His one Body, the fullness of Christ. The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, as the Body of Christ, is not produced instantaneously; it comes through growth over a period of time. When a child grows gradually into a full-grown man, he obtains the measure of the stature of a full-grown man. Likewise, we must let Christ grow in us until we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This is the measure of the stature that the church should possess. We are building a living temple, not a dead house. Hence, Ephesians 2:21 says, &ldquo;In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.&rdquo; <em>Growing</em> here indicates that the church as the dwelling place of God is living and able to grow.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Members One of Another<br />
and Being Delivered from an Individual Work</h2>
<p>The more we touch the riches of Christ, the more we should be for the church. The more we know the fullness of Christ, the more we will see that this fullness is not for an individual, because an individual cannot become the fullness of Christ. Only the church is the fullness of Christ. If only one of my hands could move, work, and walk, I would look very clumsy, and I would not have an expression of fullness. The fullness of Christ depends on the measure of the full-grown stature. In order to be one Body with the fullness of Christ, we need to be members one of another. If we see this, we will not be able to do an individual work, and we will fully know God&rsquo;s will. According to His will, God was incarnated in the Son to express His riches, and the Son passed through death, resurrection, and ascension to become the life-giving Spirit. Now as the Spirit He gives gifts who announce His riches to men. The receivers of the riches are perfected and built up with the riches into a Body, a dwelling place, a tabernacle, and a temple to be the glorious fullness of God in this universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living in the Riches of Christ<br />
and Not Making Divisions</h2>
<p>If the church were not divided and had no problems and the believers lived in the riches of the Son of God as His Body, then the fullness of the Son of God would be expressed on the earth today. If this normal situation were expressed, the whole earth would express the glorious fullness of Christ. There is no problem with Christ the Head, but there are many problems with the Body: it is divided and scattered. There can never be any problems with the riches of Christ, but the fullness of Christ is continually being attacked. Some who enjoy the riches of Christ annul the fullness of Christ. Others possess the riches of Christ but destroy the fullness of Christ. This is the desolate condition of the church. The Lord has had mercy on us, and by His sovereignty we are in His recovery. What we are doing today is recovering the fullness and recovering the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fullness of Christ Being<br />
the Expression of the Riches in Christ</h2>
<p>Some brothers may ask why John 1:16 says, &ldquo;Of His fullness we have all received&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Of His riches we have all received.&rdquo; This is not a contradiction; the riches and the fullness are actually one thing. Within Christ are the riches, but once the riches are received by us, they become the fullness of Christ. The riches in Christ are hidden, but when the riches are expressed in us, they become the fullness. The riches are in Christ, but when the riches are expressed in us, they are the fullness. Similarly, the riches in God are expressed in Christ as the fullness. Hence, Colossians 2:9 says that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. What is in Christ is His riches, but when we receive the riches of Christ, they become the fullness to us.</p>
<p>God is the source of the riches. When the riches of God are in Christ, Christ becomes the fullness of God. All the riches of God are in Christ. In Christ they are the riches; when the riches are received by us, we become the fullness of Christ. Therefore, Christ is the fullness of God, and the church is the fullness of Christ. God is doing one work in the universe. He is working Himself in His Son into us so that we become a corporate entity, His dwelling place, in which He has a full expression.</p>
<p>This is the significance of the Ark and the tabernacle in the Old Testament. The Ten Commandments are in the Ark, and the Ark is in the tabernacle. This is also portrayed by the New Jerusalem in Revelation&mdash;God as light is in the Lamb as the lamp, and the lamp is in the holy city (21:23). The lamp is the fullness of the light, the holy city is the fullness of the lamp, and the light that is expressed and shined forth is God. God is glorified in His Son, and the Son is glorified through the built-up church. We are building the church with the riches of Christ to produce the fullness of Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
