JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT<br>AND JUDGMENT UPON DAMASCUS</H2><P>In Jeremiah 49:23-27 we see Jehovah's punishment and judgment upon Damascus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Damascus Typifying the World That Is Close to<br>and Involved with the Kingdom of God</H2><P>Damascus was a part of Syria (2 Sam. 8:5). It was close to Israel and had dealings and wars with Israel (1 Kings 15:18-21; 19:15-16; 2 Kings 16:7-16; 1 Kings 11:23-25; 1 Chron. 18:5-6; 2 Chron. 24:23). Damascus typifies the world that is close to and involved with the kingdom of God. The Bible shows us that sometimes Damascus was one with Israel but at other times made trouble for Israel. Around the church today there is such an aspect of the world. Sometimes it is good to the church and sometimes it bothers the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B.
