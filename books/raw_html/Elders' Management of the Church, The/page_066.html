<P>With some, you have to admit that as soon as the Bible is put in their hand, it becomes transparent. No matter which book, chapter, or paragraph they expound, it is always clear and enlightening. You may study the same passage a thousand times, but the more you study it, the more your head spins. But when they stand up to say a few words, everything becomes clear. The reason is simple: they have the gift of being a teacher. It is useless to be proud. This is a question of gift. Those who are overseeing the house of God should realize that God's house needs all kinds of gifts.</P><P>I always rejoice in my heart and am thankful to the Lord because there are many members in His house and they have many gifts. I cannot do many things the brothers are able to do. I cannot help in many things the brothers are able to help in. I am not able to render supply in many things the brothers are able to render supply in. This is coordination. Dear brothers, the more we understand this matter clearly, the safer our coordination is.</P><P>We should feel it to be a very sweet thing that when our brother preaches the gospel, many are saved. We should feel it to be a very sweet thing that when our brother stands up to say a few words, everyone is enlightened. With all the problems, we should feel it to be a sweet thing that when a few brothers go out to visit and to fellowship, all the problems are solved. I cannot say that it is sweet because I did it, and that it is not sweet when others do it. It is not a question of me doing it or others doing it. The question is whether or not there is such a thing in the church. If there is such a thing, whether it is done by me or by others, it is equally sweet. This is coordination. I should be faithful to contribute my portion. As for others' portions, I should not only honor them, but consider them to be sweet. I can praise the others' portions and will not despise even the smallest portion among them.</P><P>On the Lord's Day morning, I often see some brothers and sisters cleaning the windows and mopping the floors in the meeting hall. They come all the time from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. I feel that this is very sweet. I feel that their service may be sweeter in the eyes of God than what we do as ministers of the Word on the podium. I have seen some older sisters who come to clean almost every week from the beginning of the year to the end. The Lord can testify for me that I have the utmost respect for these sisters. This is a coordination.</P><P>In the church there is the need for manifold gifts. Since elders are the miniature of the church, the elders must also have manifold gifts. Under normal conditions, the gifts you can find in the brothers and sisters should also be found among the elders. The elders are their representatives. Some represent service, some, administration, some, the ministry of the Word, some, the leading in life, and some, teaching. The elders should have the manifold gifts to represent the others and to take the lead. In this way the blessings will be full in the church, and many spiritual riches will be manifested. In this way, the building of the church will be solid, and the coordination, fitting.</P>
