[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE PURSUIT AND LEARNING OF THE TRUTH
[2]  Before we get into the subject matter of this message, I would like to fellowship with you concerning hymns.
[3]  For the upcoming gospel campaign I have written a new hymn entitled, The Mystery of the Universe.
[4]  Among us we need some who not only know the truth but who can also compose and sing hymns.
[5]  To speak for the Lord, we must first know the Lord s word; that is, we must know the truth.
[6]  Both Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 tell us that God s word is not only for us to speak to others but also for us to sing to others Eph 5:19; Col 3:16 .
[7]  Another new hymn for this gospel campaign is The Meaning of Human Life :
[8]  In this message my main purpose is not to teach you to learn the hymns but to fellowship with you a burden regarding your pursuit and learning.
[9]  Those of you who are presently serving full time have the day off on Monday, are working on the campuses on Saturday, and are attending meetings on the Lord s Day.
[10]  Whether we are preaching the gospel, teaching the truth, ministering life, exhorting the believers, or building the church, we need to speak for the Lord.
[11]  I am full of thanksgiving to the Lord for the saints who were in that term of the training because they have a strong desire for the Lord and have been used by the Lord.
[12]  In the United States over one hundred churches with over ten thousand saints have been raised up since the Lord s recovery began there.
[13]  Although the number is small, those who oppose us as well as those who agree with us admit that we are above everyone else regarding the truth.
[14]  Many of you know that we won the lawsuits related to the two books called The God-Men and The Mindbenders.
[15]  I hope you get the opportunity to read it so that you may understand why we initiated the lawsuit.
[16]  During the lawsuit, J. Gordon Melton, a theologian, testified in court on our behalf.
[17]  CHAPTER TWO LEARNING HOW TO SERVE THE SUCCESS OF THE CHANGE OF SYSTEM
[18]  Regarding the changing of the system, the matter that I feel most heavily burdened about within is the weakness of the ministry of the word in the meetings.
[19]  Today you may be still learning how to serve full time, but this does not excuse you from knowing how to meet in the group meetings.
[20]  It is true that in the past I said that if you wanted to learn to serve the Lord full time, you should first start by going to the meeting hall to clean the toilets, wipe the windows, sweep the floors, and arrange the chairs.
[21]  I have been in the Lord s work for more than fifty years.
[22]  Before we changed the system this last time, I considered many times before the Lord how we would accomplish such a change.
[23]  It is actually not that hard to carry out the small groups.
[24]  Those who have been trained by me can testify that what I teach in the training and what we do in actual practice are sometimes different.
[25]  We need to have a proper view of the church life.
[26]  When we arranged the specific services, we pointed out that the students should attend the meetings at the hall that is closest to their school.
[27]  If I was a parent, I probably would not allow my children to go out on the Lord s Day because they already go to school six days out of the week, so it is not so suitable for them to go out on their day off.
[28]  Whatever the Lord has established has great significance and value.
[29]  Regarding the matter of taking care of the small groups, I hope that you would exercise comprehensive care for the entire leading of the new way.
[30]  If for your specific service you are leading the students to break bread, caring for a small group, and having personal contact with others, then you should do only the campus work.
[31]  However, if you still have energy, then you should also serve the saints who meet at the meeting hall in addition to your specific service, faithfully serving in the small group at the meeting hall and helping the small group to go on.
[32]  If I were to leave you here and not care about you, I would be doing you an injustice.
[33]  CHAPTER THREE THE LEARNING IN THE FULL-TIME TRAINING THE TRANSLATION WORK OF
[34]  During the past two to three years, the matter that I have been most concerned with and that has required a great deal of consideration has been the translation work regarding the Chinese New Testament Recovery Version.
[35]  In this message I am going to give you a comprehensive word as a guide for your exercise during your time in the training.
[36]  The Lord s recovery is surely of the Lord.
[37]  This means that we believe in the Lord, follow Him, serve Him, and bear the testimony of the church for Him altogether according to the pure revelation of the holy Scriptures.
[38]  In the past we examined the characteristics of various Christian denominations, such as how much they accepted the Bible, how they practiced the Christian living, and how they set up churches.
[39]  Proverbs 29:18 begins, Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint.
[40]  If we do not have a clear vision, it will be hard for us to pursue progress in our service.
[41]  Even though we are not opening a factory for business, the principle is the same for us who are doing the Lord s work.
[42]  However, if we are ignorant, boastful, closed to the outside world, and do not pursue progress, then the Lord will not have a way among us.
[43]  The third thing that the serving ones in the recovery must do is to pursue progress in life.
[44]  This means that you must first endeavor to know the Spirit, Christ, life, the cross, and resurrection.
[45]  As long as you have the heart to do so, it will not be difficult to practice this matter.
[46]  When I was here holding the training thirty years ago, I once said, If you do not know how to conduct yourself, you will not know how to do things, and if you do not know how to do things, you will not know how to work.
[47]  All these points that I have fellowshipped about are areas in which we need to be trained.
[48]  CHAPTER FOUR THE NEED FOR TRAINING DIRECTION FOR THOSE CONSIDERING JOINING THE FULL-TIME TRAINING
[49]  In Taiwan almost all of the brothers who graduate from college are required to render two years of military service.
[50]  Thus, if they want to join the training upon graduating, they would have to simultaneously remain in school for another year.
[51]  For those of you who are in this situation, this is a practical matter that you must thoroughly consider before the Lord.
[52]  Since the present training in the church is a special training, once you miss this opportunity, you may not have such an opportunity again.
[53]  Once you set your schedule, even when you relax, you will not be fully relaxed because you will know what step to take next, and you will naturally be ready.
[54]  Perhaps the Lord will give you the feeling that your service should be short-term, in which case you should give two or three years to the Lord, or perhaps the Lord will lead you to serve long-term.
[55]  Although we do not offer any such benefits, I hope that the young saints would receive the Lord s leading to voluntarily offer up one to two years after graduating from college to receive the training and to be trained in spiritual matters such as studying the truth, pursuing life, and serving in coordination in the church life.
[56]  Therefore, I hope that you would see that although all the truths in the Bible are in our midst, you need to spend time and energy to learn them.
[57]  I feel that the co-workers are not aggressive enough and that they should be trained.
[58]  THE LORD S SERVING ONES THE NEED TO BE STRICT IN THE FULL-TIME TRAINING
[59]  The reason the Lord s work in Taiwan has been frustrated and has not been spreading is that for the past twenty years the churches here have been living a life of ease and comfort.
[60]  When I left Taiwan in 1961, there was a great number of saints meeting in the church in Taipei.
[61]  Of course, this does not mean that we despise people of low quality, because it is possible for someone who is a small potato to be gained by the Lord and to become a V.I.P. Nevertheless, we still hope that many capable, promising, and reputable people would be brought into the church.
[62]  However, you may have learned the truth and grown in life, but if the standard of your conduct and work is low and if your character is still loose, then your service in the church will surely be ineffective.
[63]  If you study the footnotes in the New Testament Recovery Version, you will discover that those footnotes were not composed in a loose way.
[64]  AND LEARNING IN LIFE DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF OUR CHARACTER TRAINING
[65]  It is good that in the recovery we have truth and life.
[66]  We have these items, but we have not entered into them to a very high degree.
[67]  Therefore, I hope that in this training you would be faithful to build up your character.
[68]  You should not be loose in the way you conduct yourself, in the way you do things.
[69]  Instead, you must be diligent, you must learn, and you must make progress.
[70]  The most important matter in this training is that in your pursuit of life you would endeavor to change your character to a character that is strict and not loose in any way.
[71]  IN COOPERATION WITH THE LORD KNOWING THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE REVELATIONS AND TEACHINGS IN THE SCRIPTURES
[72]  During the past sixty years, the trainings that we have held have been focused on four matters truth, life, the gospel, and either service or the church, which are two aspects of one thing.
[73]  Matthew 16:18 says, Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it, and 18:17 says, And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector.
[74]  If you do not read the twenty-seven books of the New Testament carefully, and if you have no desire to progress or advance in your study of the Bible, then you will have no clue as to the meaning of the Bible and will not realize what it says.
[75]  READING THE WORD AND ENTERING INTO IT REQUIRING US TO BE CAREFUL, TO BE SKILLFUL,
[76]  I have given you these examples to show you that reading the Bible is not a simple matter.
[77]  Since our training is based on the four aspects of the revelation in the New Testament truth, life, the gospel, and service or the church I hope that you all would exert an effort to read the life-study messages and footnotes according to the sequence of the New Testament.
[78]  If you do this, you will be powerful in preaching the gospel.
[79]  Those who know that you are serving full time may think that you are a Bible expert, so if you are unable to immediately answer their questions and have to go back to study the Bible in order to do so, they will be disheartened, and you will not have as much impact with them.
[80]  However, if you are able to quote the Scriptures and give a brief explanation, they will be interested in listening to you, and it will be easy for you to gain them.
[81]  Our cooperation with the Lord involves a basic principle in the Scriptures, which is that God created man with a free will, allowing man to have the freedom of choice.
[82]  Although I do not think that you are absolutely victorious, I believe that the majority of you have overcome the world and sin and have chosen the tree of life.
[83]  Therefore, you love God, you do not love the world, you forsake sin, and you do not dream about being rich.
[84]  I do not mind taking the trouble to exhort you again and again to pay attention to your character because I know that you will serve the Lord and give yourself to the Lord.
[85]  I hope that you would all exercise your will and determine to cooperate with the Lord to deal with your character so that you may become useful vessels in the Lord s hand.
[86]  Our outward weapon is the Holy Bible, the Lord s word, which is in our hands.
[87]  This is why Paul told us to receive...the sword of the Spirit, which...is the word of God Eph 6:17 , and reminded us, And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit 5:18 .
[88]  In order to serve the Lord, we must be equipped with the truth in the Scriptures and must also pursue the filling of the Spirit.
[89]  Therefore, when you go out to preach the truths in the Bible, once people see that you have a Bible in your hand, they will respect you, and when you begin to expound the truth to them, they will gladly receive it.
[90]  Hence, when you speak the truth concerning the filling of the Spirit, first you have to tell people that there are two aspects of the Spirit s filling.
[91]  This is good, but you also have to find some time in your busy schedule to kneel down before the Lord by yourself and to thoroughly pray and confess.
[92]  Once you have done this, you should simply believe that you have been filled in your spirit with the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.
[93]  In the same way, the more you remove the defilement of sin and the filthiness that is within you, the more the Holy Spirit will be able to fill you.
[94]  A. B. Simpson wrote a hymn that says, I am breathing out my sorrow, / Breathing out my sin; / I am breathing, breathing, breathing, / All Thy fulness in Hymns, #255 . Through continuous confession we breathe out our filthiness until all of our uncleanness is gone, and as we breathe out, we also breathe in. As we breathe out our sins, we breathe in God Himself.
[95]  When you speak to people concerning the filling of the Spirit, they may say, We also talk about the filling of the Spirit and may ask you, Do you speak in tongues?
[96]  CARING FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE THE INWARD AND OUTWARD FILLING
[97]  We are foolish if we study the truths in the Bible without using the life-study messages and the New Testament Recovery Version.
[98]  If we want to study the inward and outward filling of the Holy Spirit, it is even more necessary for us to use the life-study messages and the footnotes in the New Testament Recovery Version.
[99]  By serving the Lord full time, you will have time to study the truth so that when you teach others, you will be able to do so properly.
[100]  Today s Christian theological seminaries teach theology but do not touch the deep truths of the Bible.
[101]  They touch only the superficial things related to the Bible, such as the number of books and authors of the Bible, how many years it took for the Bible to be written, and where each book was written.
[102]  Regardless of whether you have been saved many years or you have only recently been saved, most of you probably do not know that the truths in the Lord s recovery are the cream of all the truths in the Bible.
[103]  I dare not say that we have dug thoroughly, but I can say that we have opened up the treasure stores, the mines, of the truths in the Bible and have put them before you.
[104]  In addition to studying the truth, you also need to pursue life, and in pursuing life, you should carefully read two books The Knowledge of Life and The Experience of Life.
[105]  The introduction to The Knowledge of Life and the preface to The Experience of Life clearly point out that although many saints have pursued life over the past two thousand years, no one has been able to clearly explain the various stages of spiritual life and the points one should know to progress along the path of life.
[106]  FOR THE LORD S SERVICE NOT BEING SLOTHFUL IN DILIGENCE
[107]  First Timothy 4:12 says, Let no one despise your youth.
[108]  Not only are young people often despised because of their youth, but even older people are despised when they act like children.
[109]  I hope that this would not cause you to consider yourself fortunate to be in the Lord s work and to say within yourself, I am going to join this profession, because once I am in, no one will have control over me.
[110]  It is true that no one will control you, but if you have this kind of intention, you will be finished and will be useless in the Lord s hand.
[111]  Although this sounds encouraging, I am concerned that when you young people enter into the Lord s work, you will become one thousand hot potatoes if your character is not trained properly.
[112]  In 2 Timothy 2 Paul used six kinds of people to depict a person who serves the Lord.
[113]  Verses 3 and 4 say that we who serve the Lord as good soldiers of Christ Jesus should not entangle ourselves with the affairs of this life.
[114]  I hope that you would concentrate all of your effort on this matter of building up your character in your living, your walk, your conduct, your speaking, and your attitude whether at home, abroad, at work, or in the church, so that you may be very useful in the Lord s hand.
[115]  By the Lord s mercy, I can tell you that when I was laboring for the Lord in Taiwan, I used the best toilets and bathtubs for the meeting halls and workers homes, but for my own home I used very simple furnishings.
[116]  CHAPTER TEN THREE MATTERS REQUIRING THE ATTENTION OF THE LORD S SERVING ONES THE FUNDAMENTAL MATTERS
[117]  If we would examine our experiences according to the Bible, we would realize that all of us who serve the Lord need to continually pay attention to three fundamental matters.
[118]  This does not mean that there are only three matters that we must pay attention to but that these three matters are the most fundamental.
[119]  The first matter is building up our character, the second matter is being equipped with the truth, and the third matter is being filled with the Holy Spirit.
[120]  The Holy Spirit Being the Ultimate Consummation of the Triune God
[121]  In the Divine Trinity, the Father is the source, the Son is the course, the expression, and the Spirit is the flow, the reaching.
[122]  When we receive the Spirit, we receive the Triune God.
[123]  The error of tritheism is that it asserts that when Jesus Christ came, He left the heavenly Father on the throne, and after He resurrected, ascended, and sat down at the right hand of God, He sent the Holy Spirit as His representative to enter into man.
[124]  Genesis 1 reveals that prior to God s restoration of the heavens and the earth, the Spirit of God brooded upon the surface of the waters v. 2 . This Spirit was the Triune God but not the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, the all-inclusive Spirit, or the processed Triune God.
[125]  God has already created the heavens and the earth, become flesh, and passed through human living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.
[126]  Moreover, Ephesians 1:13 says, In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.
[127]  Third, on the positive side, we must obey the Holy Spirit.
[128]  Obedience is the way and the requirement for us to enjoy the Holy Spirit.
[129]  For this reason, I hope that all of you young people would take the lead to pay attention to the filling of the Holy Spirit and pursue to be filled with the Holy Spirit every day.
[130]  Do not say that you cannot do these things, because it is not you who can but the Lord Jesus, the Spirit, who can.
[131]  We do not want to quench the Spirit or to grieve the Holy Spirit but to obey the Spirit and to walk according to the spirit so that we may be full of the Spirit in our daily life.
[132]  In reading the Bible you need to learn to find the main points and the general thought.
[133]  When you read the Bible, you must learn to hit the mark.
[134]  For example, when you eat chicken, you should eat its meat and not pay attention to its feathers, skin, and bones.
[135]  You greatly miss the mark, however, if you do not see the matter of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ v. 19 . Without the Spirit, how can you live Christ? Without the Spirit, how can Christ be magnified in you? The key, the life-pulse, to live Christ and to magnify Him is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[136]  Let us take Galatians 1 as another example of how to read the Bible.
[137]  In the beginning of Galatians, Paul says, Who Christ gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father v. 4 . What Paul means in this verse is that Christ died for our sins to accomplish redemption that He might rescue us not out of sin, as is commonly thought, but out of the evil age.
[138]  You have to know that regardless of how true it is that the Spirit has an essential aspect and an economical aspect, if you are not filled with Him, He cannot be the Spirit in you essentially nor the Spirit upon you economically.
[139]  We have focused very much on the Spirit since the beginning of the Lord s recovery among us.
[140]  We have not focused on a simple Spirit but on the consummated Spirit.
[141]  Our co-workers have been taught a great deal and have been going out to work, but they lack the revelation of the Holy Spirit, and they do not emphasize the Holy Spirit.
[142]  Many of us do not see the meaning of the expression to reveal His Son in me, and many also do not grasp the significance of the phrase the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[143]  When you trainees are learning to serve the Lord, you must pursue to be filled with the Holy Spirit from the outset.
[144]  Just as you cannot graduate from breathing after having breathed for one day, so also you cannot graduate from being filled with the Holy Spirit after having been filled once.
[145]  Hence, you not only need to lead people to receive the baptism in water so that they may be buried and terminated, but you also need to help them to receive the baptism in the Spirit so that they may be made alive.
[146]  Thus, when you go to the campuses and communities today, and when you go to the villages in the future, you have to cast out demons by the Holy Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God.
[147]  Once you apply the Lord s precious blood, you are covered, and once you employ the Lord s name, the demon is cast out.
[148]  Today when you go out to preach the gospel, you have to be filled with the Holy Spirit, then you have to cast out demons and heal diseases.
[149]  If you do not pursue the infilling of the Holy Spirit, I am afraid that when you go out to baptize people, everyone whom you baptize will become dead.
[150]  Prayer: Lord, cause us to touch the key point and the central line so that we may be here solidly pursuing the filling of the Holy Spirit and exercising to be filled with the Holy Spirit, so that we may have the Word and the Spirit, so that we may bring people to be put to death and to receive life, and so that our gospel may be full of power.
[151]  The Chinese hymnal lists the following headings under this category As the Spirit of Reality, As the Indwelling Spirit, As the Spirit of Jesus Christ, As the Comforter, As the Spirit of Gifts, As the Spirit of Life, As the Living Water, As the Fire, As the Breath, As the Wind, As the Ointment the Anointing , The Filling, The Baptism, The Two Aspects the Spirit of Life and the Spirit of Power , and By the Cross.
[152]  For us to experience the Spirit, the New Testament points to our human spirit.
[153]  The Bible uses three items to symbolize the Spirit breath, wind, and fire.
[154]  The two main symbols of the Spirit are breath and wind.
[155]  If you want to go to the moon, you have to bring air with you.
[156]  In John 3 the Lord Jesus also used the word pneuma with two meanings the word Spirit in the phrase born of the Spirit in verse 6 and the word wind in the clause the wind blows where it wills in verse 8 are both pneuma in Greek.
[157]  For example, you will only sense my love if I do in fact love you, you will only feel pain if I hit you, and you will only feel stuffiness if there is no air in the room.
[158]  Thus, you should not merely speak about some spiritual terms, such as the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit; neither should you simply analyze whether the Spirit is in us essentially or upon us economically; instead, you should pursue to be filled with the Spirit.
[159]  The burden of this message is to cover some practical matters in your living so that as young people pursuing to serve the Lord, you may receive some practical training and learning in three main categories eating, clothing, and sleeping and exercise.
[160]  I am going to teach you something practical about food, clothing, and being inactive and active.
[161]  If you are inactive when you should be active, or if you are active when you should be inactive, you will have great problems and much trouble.
[162]  But now that you are working for the Lord and going out to contact people, you should pay attention to the way that you dress, including the style of your clothing, the type of your clothing, and the color of your shoes and socks.
