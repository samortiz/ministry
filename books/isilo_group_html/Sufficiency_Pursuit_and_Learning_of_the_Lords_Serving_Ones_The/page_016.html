<p>In the past after a person responded to the gospel, we would speak to him concerning baptism, but there was a lack of spiritual pursuit. The brothers who would do the baptizing need to pursue the Lord concerning baptism. They should seek how to bring the new believers into the experience of dying together with the Lord. This requires the leading brothers and those responsible for baptizing to pray together and pursue the Lord. Then the brief word that they speak to the new ones before the baptisms will be weighty.</p>
<p>We have not had such a practice. Rather, we give the new ones a message in the baptismal meeting. For example, we read Romans 6:3-5: &ldquo;Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death...For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection.&rdquo; We speak to those who are being baptized concerning being baptized into the Lord&rsquo;s death, being buried, and being raised up together with the Lord. We also say that after they are buried in the water, they will come out of the water in resurrection. Then we baptize them one by one. This kind of ritual may be scriptural, but it lacks spiritual reality. The responsible brothers and those who baptize must have some reality. If they are in the reality, their service will bring the new ones into reality.</p>
<p>Although our services are established and are properly carried out, they lack something spiritual. I hope that the serving ones will receive a burden concerning our lack of spiritual pursuit. The services have become routine, and they lack spiritual reality; therefore there is neither vitality nor power. As co-workers, we must rise up to deal with this situation. We should not think that we are incapable of doing certain things, nor should we be self-abased and buried by an inferiority complex. We need to overcome in this matter. Even if we are incapable, we can still pursue the Lord. We need a fresh love and a genuine pursuit of the Lord. If we gain something in our spiritual pursuit, we should not become stagnant or stop. We must be those who are running the race, forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, because there is no limit in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURSUING WITH SPIRITUAL COMPANIONS</h2>
<p>In addition to our personal pursuit we should pursue with our companions. We often fall into a situation that we cannot handle by ourselves. For this reason, we need spiritual companions. The situation that is emerging among us indicates that we are individualistic and do not have companions. Hence, we must look for companions to pursue with. Second Timothy 2:22 says, &ldquo;Pursue...with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo; This is the way that we must take. Very few co-workers are willing to pursue the Lord with two or three others. In other words, few co-workers have companions; most pursue on their own. We cannot escape the fact that we need companions. Two or three should come together a few times per week to pursue the Lord together. There is a need for a fresh atmosphere of spiritual pursuit among us.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy the co-workers need to have a fresh pursuing. No matter how many messages we have heard or how many lessons we have learned, we must realize that Christ and His Body are the way we are taking. Hence, we must rise up and pursue the Lord in a fresh way. This is the key. Everything we do depends on this. Perhaps some of us have a weak will or do not have a proper character. Whatever our problem may be, there is a remedy, which is to have a fresh, living, deep, and serious pursuit of the Lord. Not everyone&rsquo;s function has been manifested, but if we have companions, everyone will have a deep pursuit of the Lord.</p>
<p>Galatians 6:7 says, &ldquo;Whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.&rdquo; Second Corinthians 9:6 says, &ldquo;He who sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap.&rdquo; This is a principle. The amount of effort we spend determines the benefit we reap. We should not think that the co-workers who are intelligent or who have a strong will have an advantage. What matters is the effort we put into pursuing the Lord. An intelligent brother who has a strong will should not think that he can be enlightened quickly. Even if he has an advantage, it is temporary, because haste makes waste. The faster we are able to enter into something, the faster we will withdraw from it. The fact that we have gained something should not stop us from going on. That is too shallow.</p>
<p>A musician once said that if he skipped one day of practice, only he would notice it. If he skipped two days of practice, his family would notice it. If he skipped three days of practice, his friends would notice it, and if he skipped one week of practice, he would not be able to perform. This shows that the extent of our influence on others depends on our pursuit of the Lord.</p>
<p>The serving ones who regard themselves as incapable do not need to feel inferior or discouraged. Such feelings are meaningless. We need to understand that we are unable and incapable, but there is one thing that we can do: we can pursue the Lord, be drawn by Him, and have a fresh love for Him. This is precious in the sight of God. If we do not have love, He can stir up our love. We can pray because we have a pursuing heart, not because we know the right words or have the right tone. This pursuing has no end and will always be fresh. This is what Paul says in Philippians 3:12 and 13: he forgot the things which were behind and stretched forward to the things which were ahead so that he could lay hold of the Lord. This can be compared to the words of the lover in Song of Songs 1:2 and 4: &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!... / Draw me; we will run after you.&rdquo; Our service is not a matter of gift, knowledge, or ability. It is entirely a matter of our pursuit. If we are such persons, we will always be effective, no matter what the situation is. Then our service and work will not be merely a shell or an outward form. There will be reality, content, vitality, and power within our service. Moreover, our service and work will be fresh. This kind of pursuit needs to be raised up among us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Sufficiency, Pursuit, and Learning of the Lord's Serving Ones &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
