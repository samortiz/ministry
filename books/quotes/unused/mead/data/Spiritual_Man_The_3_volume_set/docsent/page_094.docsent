   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Holy Spirit will let such a one realize that all his work and life are merely centered on and motivated by his "self," and that he does not allow the Lord to be Lord over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the good deeds he has done are done according to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many among them may be simply for his own glory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the works he does are done not by the way of seeking God's will, not by being willing to submit to God, follow God's leading, and trust in God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He does nothing except what is according to his own will, having his own way in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, all his outward prayer and seeking God's will are merely hypocritical.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although he applies the gift given to him by God, he only single-mindedly thinks and boasts of the gift he received, and he sets aside the Lord who gave the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although he has many gifts, he simply uses these gifts and never cares for the will of the Lord who gave him the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although he zealously seeks the words of the Lord, he is not willing to wait for God's time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His asking the Holy Spirit to reveal to him and to make him understand is merely to seek for knowledge so as to satisfy the desire of his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although he seeks God's presence, wanting to feel the Lord's love and closeness, this is not for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He simply wants to make himself happy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not because he loves the Lord, but it is because he loves that kind of feeling, for that feeling makes him feel refreshed, happy, and as having the glory of "the third heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All his living and work are only centered on himself, hoping to make himself happy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is after a revelation of the Holy Spirit that the believer realizes how abominable his own life is and understands the former foolishness of upholding his own soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of revelation does not come suddenly but gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It does not happen once for all, but occurs again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Holy Spirit shines on a believer with light for the first time, he repents in the light and is willing to put the soul-life to death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But since man's heart is very wicked, after a little while, perhaps just a few days, the heart of self-confidence, self-love, and self-amusement in the believer returns again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, this kind of revelation comes frequently so that the believer may be willing to renounce his soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the most pitiful situation is that there is hardly anyone who would automatically submit to the Lord and have the sight of the Lord in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is always after the Holy Spirit has allowed the believer to fall numerous times and experience many defeats that he becomes willing to renounce his soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But even if he is willing, how incomplete the willingness is, and how easily the willingness is liable to change!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Believers should abandon foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should accept God's viewpoint and consider our life as truly unable to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should have a heart without fear to let the Holy Spirit expose all the pitiful places of our soul-life one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should by faith trust God's appraisal of our life and be willing to wait for the Holy Spirit to reveal our life to us through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only by this will He be able to lead us on the pathway of deliverance from our soul-life.</S>
