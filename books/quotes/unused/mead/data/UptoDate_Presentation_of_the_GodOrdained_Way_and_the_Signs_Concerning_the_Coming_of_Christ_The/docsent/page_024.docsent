   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we trace the history in the Old Testament, we see that God raised up Gentile powers to chastise Israel because of Israel's rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, God raised up Chaldea, also known as Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 606 B.C. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, led a great army to destroy the holy city, Jerusalem, and the holy temple, and he brought all the children of Israel as captives to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, because Nebuchadnezzar was too cruel toward the children of Israel, seventy years after Israel's captivity, God raised up the empire of Medo-Persia.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From the book of Isaiah we can see that Cyrus, the king of Persia, was God's beloved, and he even became a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 539 B.C. Cyrus defeated Babylon and, under God's inspiration, released the children of Israel that they might go back to rebuild the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is recorded in the book of Ezra Then, after another four kings, King Artaxerxes gave the order for the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is recorded in the book of Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, for a period of time Persia was doing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At approximately 330 B.C., Alexander rose to power in Macedonia, north of Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When he was in his thirties he formed the Grecian Empire, and within a short time he conquered the land east of the Mediterranean all the way to the Indian Ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus he defeated Persia, symbolized by the ram.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When he invaded Jerusalem, the high priest Jaddua went to meet him and showed him the portion in Daniel concerning the he-goat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After reading it, Alexander had great appreciation for it, so he began to treat the Jews with leniency.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He had strength like that of a goat and was brutal and high-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>History records that when he returned to Macedonia, he wore a crown with a he-goat's horn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After Pember came Robert Govett, who wrote concerning the biblical prophecies with the greatest accuracy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later, his student D.M. Panton published a magazine entitled Dawn, in which he released a number of truths concerning prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He gave financial assistance to M.E. Barber, enabling her to come to mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>M.E. Barber originally came with a British mission to Foochow, China to do missionary work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later, because of some false accusations, she was called back to England.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the storm calmed down, she withdrew from the mission and received the burden from the Lord to come back to China.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time the Lord raised up Brother Watchman Nee in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Nee not only learned many precious spiritual lessons from Miss Barber, but also through her recommendation came in contact with the writings of Panton and others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1928 in Shanghai, Brother Nee had a Bible study on the book of Revelation, and he gave me a draft of the notes when I joined the Lord's work in 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then in 1976, in Anaheim, California, I held a training on the Life-study of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today in the Recovery Version of the New Testament, the notes related to the prophecies are extracts obtained through my study of the writings of Darby, Pember, Govett, Panton, and Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These notes are very clear and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, our knowledge concerning the biblical prophecies has a solid foundation; it did not come out of our own imagination, nor is it our original, unique creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, what we see is an advancement that we made by standing on the shoulders of those who were before us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By studying the writings of these Bible scholars, we have concluded that, in the past two hundred years, if those who have expounded the prophecies concerning the Lord's second coming made any mistakes, their mistakes were on two points.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first point is related to the last week of the seventy weeks in Daniel, and the second is related to the coming of Christ and the rapture of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In expounding the prophecies, anyone who neglects the last of the seventy weeks will fall into error.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the past some said that Napoleon was the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, Napoleon was a French king, and in his time the nation of Israel was not yet restored.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the 1930s, Panton said that Mussolini was the Antichrist, and he published the pictures of Nero and Mussolini, pointing out the resemblance between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later, others said that Hitler was Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, Antichrist will be resuscitated after being slain, but Hitler's body was not even intact for burial after his death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Recently, there has been a great change in the Middle East situation, and some have predicted that Iraq's President Hussein will be the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, Hussein is an Arab, but Antichrist will come out of one of the nations around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All these sayings are wrong and are not in accordance with the prophecy concerning the last week.</S>
