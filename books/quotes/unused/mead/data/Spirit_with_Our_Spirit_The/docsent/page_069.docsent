   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the sanctifying Spirit sanctifies us, there is a shaping element to shape us into the image of the glorious Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This shaping makes us the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why we can manifest Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The divine sanctification, from its beginning to its ending, is altogether the fine work of the consummated, compound, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit of Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
