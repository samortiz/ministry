God wants us to be the God-men at the top of the heavenly ladder, but we may not even be on the first rung of the ladder. We are so natural. Therefore, we need to be discipled to see how the Lord lived a divine life by putting His natural life aside. To live a divine life and put off our natural life is divine and mystical.</p><p>Often co-workers or elders may come to me and say that they cannot tolerate a certain person. I never instruct them what to do or how to deal with that kind of person. I simply tell them not to do anything. Their situation indicates that they need to be conformed to the death of Christ even more. Sometimes people come to me with tears, but I tell them that their tears are not meaningful. They simply need to go back and be more conformed to the death of Christ and to live the divine life by denying themselves. Today I am more conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death than I have been in sixty years, but my conformation to His death is still not perfected; it is still going on, and I am still under the Lord&rsquo;s discipling. To some extent I am still not a God-man. Often throughout the day I pray to the Lord, &ldquo;In certain matters, I have not denied myself. My self is still here, and I am too much in myself.&rdquo; I pray this more than once a day. I am under the Lord&rsquo;s discipling. I am a natural man in Adam&rsquo;s race; I am not fully a God-man. I am still a &ldquo;caterpillar in the cocoon&rdquo; and not a &ldquo;butterfly.&rdquo; To be discipled is to be brought from being a &ldquo;caterpillar&rdquo; to becoming a &ldquo;butterfly.&rdquo;</p><p>How could Peter, a Jewish fisherman, become a God-man? Peter had never seen a God-man. It is as if the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Come and follow Me. I will show you a pattern of what a God-man is.&rdquo; Peter watched Him for three and a half years. However, Peter was still like a man of dust with no breath. He did not have the divine life within him until the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Then he became different because the Spirit was breathed into him. He was enlivened, and he lived a God-man life in practicality and actuality, denying himself and living God. This is the way he was discipled.</p><p>We have seen the God-man living, but we have not seen it enough. Peter saw it for three and a half years. Up until the end of the Lord&rsquo;s life in the flesh Peter still had many questions. He may have asked, &ldquo;What is this man?&rdquo; Once he told the Lord that he would not deny Him as others would, but the Lord told him that Satan had asked to have him to sift him as wheat and that he would deny Him three times (Luke 22:31-34). In this way Peter was discipled. He spoke as a natural man. He should have said, &ldquo;Lord, I am no exception. I am the same as all my brothers, and I may be weaker than them. Lord, have mercy upon me and save me.&rdquo; Similarly, we may say that we are able to live in corporate living, but eventually we will find out that we are not. We should have no trust in ourselves.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A Word of Love to the Co-Workers, Elders, Lovers, and Seekers of the Lord &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
