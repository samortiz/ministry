<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICAL WAY TO SUPPORT<br />
THE JOB-DROPPING FULL-TIMERS FOR THE INCREASE<br />
AND SPREAD OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>I have been considering quite much the practical way to carry out this burden. I considered the practice of the China Inland Mission which was founded by Hudson Taylor. He was a real man of God, but just according to the portion he had in his time. We must remember that the Lord is moving on. However, it is worthwhile for us to go back to compare the various practices. Twenty-eight years ago I visited the People&rsquo;s Church in Toronto, established by Mr. Oswald Smith. Apparently, I was trying to have a sight-seeing tour of the country, but my real heart was to see this famous church. They were famous in sending out missionaries. If they had twenty members, they would send one out for missionary work. I looked at their furniture and the church building. Everything was so old, but very clean and well maintained. There had been no fresh painting for years. They saved nearly every cent for sending one out of twenty members as a missionary. It was a great burden for them to carry, but they did it. That impressed me very much; I could never forget that.</p>
<p>In October of 1984 when I was considering the fact that there was nearly no increase or spreading among us, I went back to Taiwan. The church called a large gathering in a basketball stadium, which was filled with about twelve thousand people. The messages I gave were concerning the increase and spread of Christ and the church. My burden was for this. For years we did not have much increase or the spreading. We nearly remained the same. This caused me to reconsider our way. I considered our way and the ways of others, and I came to a conclusion. In any church out of twenty there must be one who drops his business or profession to take the full-time way to preach and to teach. The nineteen others should do their best regularly, even weekly, to put aside a certain amount of their monthly income for the supporting of such a one. For nineteen to support one would be, humanly speaking, very easy. Each one simply saves five percent of their income. This would be sufficient to support the one who drops his job. This ninety-five percent is the equivalent of a full-time job for the one who drops his job. This will not burden the church. It will be easy. There is a proverb which says, &ldquo;If all the people will lift, it is easy to lift up anything.&rdquo; When the meeting hall in Anaheim was built, the brothers, climbing up the stairway, carried a steel beam weighing close to one ton from the yard and put it upon two steel posts. We were not able to use a crane. Simply with so many hands it was easy to lift that heavy beam.</p>
<p>Charge the dear saints that besides their regular giving to the Lord through the church, they should give an additional five percent of their income every month. Do not do it once a year. It is better to separate the amount for each month into four equal portions and put one portion every Lord&rsquo;s Day into the offering box.</p>
<p>Whether or not in your locality there are these job-dropping full-timers, you should still practice this. In your place there may not be such, yet in other places there may be. In one hall in Taipei full of college students a number will go full-time. But in that hall there are nearly no businessmen, no brothers who have a better job. Yet in another hall there are many rich men, making much money. Very few are college graduates, and none of them would think to drop their job. They should practice to save five percent of their income to take care of those in the other halls, in other churches, and even in other countries. If we are in one accord on the whole earth, the church must practice this, encouraging and charging all the saints each month to designate five percent of their income specifically for supporting the job-dropping full-timers throughout the whole earth. Go back to charge the church in your locality to practice this five percent giving for the furtherance of the gospel, the fellowship unto the gospel.</p>
<p>Do not say that you do not have any job-dropping full-timers. All the churches on the earth have to do this. Leave to the Lord how much will be accomplished, but you must practice the five percent giving. Train everyone among us to practice the putting aside of an extra five percent, putting it aside uniquely for the fellowship unto the gospel. I believe that the Lord will bless this. This is for His spreading. How much He desires to spread through us! But for this spreading today, there is the need of financial support. We do not need to have a fund raising movement. We do not need to send someone to convince all the churches to contribute money. We simply need a regular, weekly practice of giving in this way, designated for the fellowship unto the gospel.</p>
<p>Any gifts should be designated with these words: &ldquo;Fellowship unto the Gospel.&rdquo; Every church should have such a separate &ldquo;Fellowship unto the Gospel&rdquo; account. This way is easy, unique, and universal. The saints could give one fourth of five percent of their monthly income each week. However, if there is no urgent need, they may practice giving monthly.</p>
<p>This has to be practiced for the long run. We mean business. We are now taking a new way to carry out the five points which were very much stressed by Brother Nee in his ministry&mdash;the home gatherings, the functioning of all the members, the knowledge and spread of the truth, the growth in life, and the preaching of the gospel in every way. The key point of this way is that every believer is a full-timer. Some drop their job to preach and teach, while some remain on their job to make money. We must encourage some to drop their jobs. We must also encourage some to make money and separate five percent monthly, purposely for the account of the fellowship unto the gospel.</p>
