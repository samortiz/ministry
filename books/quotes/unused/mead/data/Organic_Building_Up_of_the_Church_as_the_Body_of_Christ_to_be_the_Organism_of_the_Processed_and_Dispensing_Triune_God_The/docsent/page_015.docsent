   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the last three chapters, we have seen three intrinsic matters related to the church: the church s intrinsic essence, intrinsic growth, and intrinsic building up.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a very sweet term, but it is difficult to get the proper, accurate, adequate, and equivalent term in the English language.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The problem is that the proper meaning of the term fellowship, along with many other crucial terms in the Bible, has been spoiled by the traditional or religious interpretation in Christianity.</S>
