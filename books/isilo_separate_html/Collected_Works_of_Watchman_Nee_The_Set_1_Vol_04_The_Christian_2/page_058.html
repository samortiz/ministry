The following are the proofs: (1) "He who believes has eternal life" (John 6:47). Once we believe, we have it, and what we have is eternal life. Since it is eternal life, there is no possibility for one to perish halfway. (2) What the Lord Jesus accomplished on the cross was "an eternal redemption" (Heb. 9:12). Hence, every sinner who trusts in Him receives the efficaciousness of this eternal redemption. As such, the efficaciousness of the blood of the Lord Jesus is eternal with those who believe in Him. (3) The prayer of the Lord Jesus as the high priest is the preserving power for the believers to be saved to the uttermost. "Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them" (Heb. 7:25). If a believer should perish, it would mean that the Lord Jesus' prayer had lost its power. All those who think this way are blaspheming Him! (4) Once a sinner believes in the Lord Jesus, he receives the Holy Spirit and is joined to the Lord in life, becoming a member of the Body of Christ. If a believer could still perish, the Body of the Lord Jesus would become crippled. "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 8:1). (5) The believers are God's gifts to the Lord Jesus (John 10:29). If believers could perish, then what the Father gives to the Son would be something that is not eternal. This is unimaginable. If God's grace to the world is without repentance, how can He withdraw what He has given to His own beloved Son? (6) Since salvation is not received through works (Eph. 2:1, 8-9), it cannot be lost through works. (7) If believers could perish, all the New Testament Scriptures that assert the Lord's preserving power would become absurd. (8) When a sinner believes in the Lord Jesus to be his Savior, he is begotten of God and has become God's child (John 1:12-13). Since he is begotten, he cannot be unbegotten again. Once he has become a child, no matter how much he sins, he will always be a child. Since what he has received is eternal life, such a relationship can never be severed. (9) Those who are saved by God in this age have been predestinated by God before the foundation of the world. If we admit that the matter of salvation is under God's sovereign hand, it is impossible for a person predestinated by God to salvation to be lost again. "And those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified" (Rom. 8:30). God predestinated in the past, and He will glorify in the future. Now He is calling and justifying. The believers are guaranteed to be saved into eternal glory. (10) Look again at the promise of the Lord Jesus, where this question is considered to be settled: "My sheep...shall by no means perish forever" (John 10:27-28). Once a person has become the Lord's sheep, he will by no means perish forever. This is spoken by the Lord Himself. The reason that one cannot perish forever is (a) "No one shall snatch them out of My hand" (John 10:28), and (b) "No one can snatch them out of My Father's hand" (John 10:29). From these points we can see that the question of salvation for every believer is settled and fully secured. Praise the Lord!</P><P>(2) After a believer is saved, if he sins and transgresses by accident, he should come immediately before God to confess his sins. God will forgive his sins based on the work of the cross. We should differentiate between the condition of forgiveness for the sinners and for the believers. The sinners are forgiven through believing; the saints are forgiven through confessing. First John 1:9 says: "If we [the Christians] confess our sins [the unique condition], He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." A sinner cannot be forgiven by mere confessing, whereas a saint cannot be forgiven by mere believing. When a saint sins, and when he comes to God to confess his sins, based on the work of the Lord Jesus, he will immediately be forgiven. In the future at the judgment seat, this sin will no longer condemn him. However, here is a problem. It is true that there are many believers who have confessed their wrongdoings and have asked God for forgiveness. Yet there are still many who die with their sins unconfessed and never repented of. Shall these ones also be eternally saved and not come under God's judgment? Sin is sin. God must judge sin as sin and punish sin as sin. If a believer has not confessed his sins, he will not be able to have the effectiveness of the cross of the Lord applied to those particular sins. As a result, he will have to bear his own sins. God judges and punishes sin, whether it is in the sinner or in the believer.</P><P>A saved Christian will be punished. For this, there are the following proofs: (1) "For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit...to renew themselves again...It is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned" (Heb. 6:4, 6, 8). Such a one is surely saved and has surely believed. Yet he will still experience the punishment of burning. (2) "For when we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries" (Heb. 10:26-27). The words "there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins" indicate that there was a sacrifice for sins before. Hence, this proves that such a person is saved. However, because such a one has sinned willfully, he will suffer the fervor of fire which is about to consume the adversaries. When a believer sins with the sinners, he will be punished with the sinners. (3) "If one does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned" (John 15:6). There is still the danger for those who have already become a branch to be cast out, to become dry, and to be cast into the fire. (4) "Whoever says to his brother...Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire" (Matt. 5:22). Since both are brothers, both are saved ones. Yet the one who sins by reviling the other shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire. (5) "Every one therefore who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father who is in the heavens; but whoever shall deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in the heavens" (Matt. 10:32-33). The "every one" here is the "you" in verse 31, who are the disciples. It is possible for those who are already disciples of the Lord to be denied by Him. (6) "My friends, Do not fear those who kill the body and afterward have nothing more that they can do. But I will show you whom you should fear: fear Him who, after killing, has authority to cast into Gehenna; yes, I tell you, fear this One" (Luke 12:4-5). The Lord's friends are the saved believers. Yet, among them some will be cast into Gehenna. (7) "Many will say to Me in that day [the day of the judgment seat], Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power? And then I will declare to them: I never knew you [lit., I never justified you]. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness" (Matt. 7:22-23). Those who hear the Lord's word but do not obey and who work according to their own will, though they will not perish, they will hear the Lord's severe words to them. (8) "And cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth" (Matt. 25:30). Those slaves who have received the gift of the Holy Spirit have become members in the Body of Christ. Yet, through their digging of the earth and hiding of their talent, they misjudged the Lord and were cast midway into the outer darkness. (9) "But if that slave says in his heart, My master is delaying his coming, and begins to beat the male servants and the female servants and to eat and to drink and become drunk, the master of that slave...will cut him asunder, and will appoint his portion with the unbelievers. And that slave who knew his master's will and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes; but he who did not know, yet did things worthy of stripes, will receive few lashes. But to every one to whom much has been given, much will be required from him; and to whom much has been committed, they will ask of him all the more" (Luke 12:45-48). The slaves to whom the Lord has "given" and committed something are the saved ones. Yet through their disobedience to God's will, they will be cut in two by the Lord. (10) "He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death" (Rev. 2:11). Those who do not overcome will be hurt of the second death, which is the hurt of hell. From these points we can see that if a saved Christian sins and does not confess his sin, he will not experience the effectiveness of the cross, but will suffer serious punishments. God is love; yet He is also righteous.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> </body></html>
