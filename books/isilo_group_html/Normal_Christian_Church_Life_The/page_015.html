Here was a group of new believers, mere babes in Christ, and their fathers in the faith forsook them in their infancy. Did they argue, &#8220;Why should the apostles be afraid of persecution and leave us to face the opposition alone?&#8221; Did they plead with the apostles to remain awhile and care for their spiritual welfare? Did they reason, &#8220;If you leave us now we shall be as sheep without a shepherd. If both of you cannot stay, surely one at least can remain behind and look after us. The persecution is so intense, we shall never get through without your help.&#8221; How amazing the Scripture record is: &#8220;And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit&#8221; (v. 52).<p>There was no mourning among the disciples when the apostles left, but great gladness. The disciples were glad, for they knew the Lord; and they might well rejoice, because the apostles&#8217; departure meant an opportunity for others to hear the gospel. What was loss to them was gain to Iconium. Those believers were not like the believers of today, hoping for a settled pastor to instruct them, solve their problems, and shelter them from trouble. And those apostles were not like the apostles of today; they were pioneers, not settlers. They did not wait till believers were mature before they left them. They dared to leave them in mere infancy, for they believed in the power of the life of God within them.<p>But those disciples were not only filled with joy; they were filled with the Holy Spirit. The apostles might go, but the Spirit remained. Had the apostles remained to pastor them, it would have mattered little whether they were filled with the Spirit or not. If they had had a pastor to throw light on all their problems, they would have felt little need of the Spirit&#8217;s instruction; and they would have felt little need of His power if they had had one in their midst who was bearing all responsibility for the spiritual side of the work while they attended to the secular. In Scripture there is not the slightest hint that apostles should settle down to pastor those they have led to the Lord. There are pastors in Scripture, but they are simply brethren raised up of God from among the local saints to care for their fellow believers. One of the reasons why so many present-day converts are not filled with the Spirit is that the apostles settle down to shepherd them and take upon themselves the responsibility that belongs to the Holy Spirit.<p>Praise God that the apostles moved on to Iconium, for &#8220;a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed&#8221; (14:1). Before long &#8220;the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews and some with the apostles&#8221; (v. 4). The saved were obviously a great multitude, since their coming out from the unsaved so vitally affected the place as to cause a division in the city. Only a short time after the apostles left Antioch in Pisidia, there was a church established in Iconium; and here, as in the previous place, opposition was intense. The apostles might well have argued that to leave a great multitude of mere babes in Christ exposed to fierce persecution was heartless, and bad policy besides. But the apostles were true to their apostolic calling, and off they went &#8220;to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe&#8221; (v. 6). And what did they do when they came to Lystra? As elsewhere, so here, &#8220;they announced the gospel&#8221; (v. 7), and as elsewhere, so here, there was opposition and persecution (v. 19). It is difficult to estimate the number of believers at Lystra, but judging by the remark that the disciples surrounded Paul (v. 20), there must have been at least half a dozen, and there may have been scores or even hundreds. So now there is a church in Lystra!<p>Does Paul stay to shepherd them awhile, or at least to tend them till the fierceness of the opposition has subsided? No! &#8220;On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe&#8221; (v. 20). And there again the glad tidings are proclaimed and many disciples are made (v. 21). So another church is formed! And with the founding of a church in Derbe the first missionary tour of the apostles closes.<p>Looking back over these two chapters, we note that a fundamental principle governs the movements of the apostles. They travel from place to place, according to the leading of the Spirit, preaching the gospel and founding churches. Nowhere do we find them settling down to shepherd and instruct the converts, or to bear any local responsibility in the churches they have founded. In days of peace the apostles were on the move, and in days of persecution likewise. &#8220;Go!&#8221; was the word of the Lord, and &#8220;Go!&#8221; was the watchword of the apostles. The outstanding trait of a sent one is that he is always on the move.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Normal Christian Church Life &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
