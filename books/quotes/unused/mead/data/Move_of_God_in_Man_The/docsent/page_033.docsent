   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is another verse in the Bible, however, which says that God forsook Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 27:46 says, "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can we reconcile this verse with the other verses in the Scripture which show that Christ's crucifixion was God's crucifixion?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the very juncture when the Lord Jesus was going to give up His spirit, He cried, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, God never left the Son, but on the other hand, the Son cried out that God had forsaken Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to answer this question, we need to see the essential and economical aspects of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the history of theology, the students of the Bible have seen two aspects of the Divine Trinity: the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The essential Trinity refers to the very intrinsic essence of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In essence the three of the Trinity are one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The First dwells in the Second, the Second dwells in the Third, and the Third dwells in the First and the Second.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The three coinhere, dwell in each other, essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are one and cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But economically speaking, that is, according to God's economy, God's plan, and God's accomplishing of His purpose, the three are distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the three were not distinct, how could the First forsake the Second?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Another picture of the economical Trinity can be seen at the Lord's baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the time of His baptism, the Father was in the heavens, the Son was in the water, and the Spirit was in the air like a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Son in the water on the earth heard the Father in the heavens speaking Matt 3:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this case the three of the Godhead are not only distinct; They are in three different locations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to have a complete view of the Divine Trinity, we need to see His economical and essential aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 10:30 the Lord said, "I and the Father are one."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In John 14:10-11 the Son told the disciples, "I am in the Father and the Father is in Me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Are They separated?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No. They are one essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when They act to carry out Their economy, to finish Their plan, to accomplish Their purpose, quite often They are distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the Son's baptism the Father was distinct from the Son, and the Son was distinct from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Gospels also show us that the Son prayed to the Father, and when He prayed, He lifted up His eyes to heaven John 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we see that the Father and the Son are distinct economically.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Essentially speaking, the crucifixion of Christ was God's crucifixion, but at the juncture when Christ gave up His spirit, God forsook Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God was there essentially, but He forsook Him economically.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to realize that the study of the Divine Trinity is an endless matter.</S>
