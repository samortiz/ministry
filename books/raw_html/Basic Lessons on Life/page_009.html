<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Human Spirit Being Able<br>to Contact God and to Be One with Him</H2><P>Because our human spirit is close to God and there is a transmission between God the Spirit and our human spirit, our human spirit is able to contact God and to be one with God. John 4:24, which says that God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit, proves that our spirit is able to contact God. Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit bears witness with our spirit. This verse uses the preposition with. That means God's Spirit is one with our spirit. This little word with is very precious, indicating that now our spirit is one with God's Spirit. We need to stress these points again and again, especially with the new ones. The new ones who have come into the church life in the last two years need this kind of help.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. WITH A MIND TO UNDERSTAND GOD</H2><P>Man was made not only with a spirit but also with a mind to understand God (Luke 24:45; Rom. 12:2). To contact God, to receive God, and to contain God is one thing, but to understand God is another thing. We have a spirit to receive God but we also have a soul, a psuche. In referring to people, the Bible calls them souls (Exo. 1:5; Acts 2:41). Every person is a soul. We are a psychological being, a soul, with the faculty of understanding. God created man with a mind, a part of the soul, so that man could understand God. The understanding is the function of the mind. Luke 24:45 says that the Lord opened the mind of the disciples to understand the Scriptures. This is a very good verse proving that we need to understand God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. WITH AN EMOTION TO LOVE GOD</H2><P>Man was also created with an emotion to love God (Matt. 22:37). The Bible shows that in our psychological being, besides the mind as the understanding organ, there is also the emotion as the loving organ. Matthew 22:37 says that we should love the Lord our God with all our heart and all our mind. The mind is also a part of the heart but it is separately mentioned in this verse. Since the mind is separately mentioned here, surely this indicates that the heart in this verse must refer to the loving function of the heart, that is, the emotion. After we receive God, we have to understand Him. After we understand Him, surely we have to appreciate Him, like Him, love Him, and treasure Him. Thus, an emotion, the loving function of our heart, was also prepared for us by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. WITH A WILL TO CHOOSE GOD</H2><P>Man was created with a will to choose God. Without his will, man would have no choice, no decision, no direction, and no goal. Thus, God created a strong choosing organ for man. In our psychological being, our will is the strongest part. Even after the fall of man, God still somewhat preserved the human will for His purpose. When we believe in the Lord Jesus, this is a strong determination on our part by the exercise of our will. Martin Luther is an example of a person whose will was very strong, so he had great faith. To have strong faith always depends upon a very strong will.</P>
