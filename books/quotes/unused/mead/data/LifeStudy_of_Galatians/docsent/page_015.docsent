   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CALLED BY GOD THROUGH HIS GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1:15 Paul also says that God called him through His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul was called to be an apostle through the grace of Christ, not through the law that came by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This calling took place at the time of his conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We also can testify that we have been called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, God s calling of us began with His setting us apart from our mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we spend time to review our past, we shall see that God s calling of us began with our conception in the womb.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God arranged the time and place of our birth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then He called us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How grateful I am to the Lord that He caused me to be conceived in the womb of one who was in Christianity, although she was not saved at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way God caused me to be born into Christianity, beginning His calling of me by setting me apart from my mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then one day, in 1925, God s calling was accomplished in a full way when I believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>None of us should have any doubt about being called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, let us worship Him and thank Him for His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything related to us, such as our family and education, is according to God s sovereignty and related to His calling of us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>HAVING THE SON OF GOD REVEALED IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1:15 and 16 Paul says that God was pleased to reveal His Son in him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Son of God was unveiled to Paul and shown to him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that he received a vision of the living Person of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since Paul is a pattern of the believers and the Son of God was revealed in him, we also should have Christ revealed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Son of God is revealed in us, something divine is added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Selection and calling do not cause anything to be added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the revelation of the Son of God in us causes divinity to be added to our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God Himself is added into our being to become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He who has the Son has life 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, to have the Son of God revealed in us means to have God added to us to become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>NOT CONFERRING WITH FLESH AND BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the Son of God was revealed in Paul, he did not confer with flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that he did not confer with man, who is made up of flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This confirms the fact that Paul did not receive the gospel from man 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After we believed in the Lord Jesus, many of us immediately conferred with others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we recall our experience, we shall realize that much of this was of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As soon as I was saved, I turned to various people for help.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, I was only frustrated by them and cooled down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some of you may have spoken to certain preachers or ministers, only to find that you were discouraged by your contact with them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When young believers contacted me thirty years ago, I had a great deal to say.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But it is much different today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now when others contact me, I simply tell them to pray and to seek the Lord, to bring everything to Him for His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not want to be the flesh and blood with which others confer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should neither confer with flesh and blood, nor should we be the flesh and blood with whom others confer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us leave others and their situation to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>V. NOT GOING UP TO JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>TO THOSE WHO WERE APOSTLES BEFORE HIM</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul opens verse 17 with the words, Neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all have made mistakes in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have gone to a place we consider today s Jerusalem seeking to confer with certain leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To go to some Jerusalem to those who were apostles before us is something of tradition and of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Actually, it is to confer with flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some of the leading ones may be concerned that such a word will cause the saints not to seek the proper fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, they may think that this will ruin the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But would it not be wonderful for all the saints to be trained not to confer with flesh and blood?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How good it would be if we all brought ourselves with our needs and problems directly to the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we would be today s apostles, we should follow Paul s pattern in not going up to Jerusalem to confer with others.</S>
