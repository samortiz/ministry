   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE GOD-REDEEMER-</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:3-4, 22, 36-38, 44-45, 50-54; 2 Cor 3:6b, 17-18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen the seven steps that God has taken in Christ to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The most mysterious step is the sixth, the indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the most strategic step in accomplishing God s project.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s intention is to work Himself into us that we may have Him as our life, our person, and our content.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then, as His Body, we will be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To accomplish this, God first of all became incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He mingled Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then, as a man in the flesh, He was put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Satan s thought was to put Him to death, but Satan did not realize that by the cross all the negative things in the universe were terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sin, self, the old man, the soulish life, the human fallen nature, the world, Satan, the demons, and all negative things were ended on the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the Lord was crucified and buried, He rested on the Sabbath day John 19:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He had finished everything on the cross and declared, It is finished John 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then He rested in the grave to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But on the first day of the next week John 20:1 He arose from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His death was a termination to the old creation, and His resurrection was the germination to the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then, by His ascension, He was inaugurated into His position of Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was fully authorized to be the Savior Acts 5:31 , the King of kings, the Lord of lords, and the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was officially put into such a position.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After ten days, He descended as the Spirit to put all of God s chosen people into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was the baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was accomplished once and for all on the day of Pentecost Acts 2 for the Jews and at the house of Cornelius Acts 10 for the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We were all baptized then and made members of His Body 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now the Lord dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has to indwell us in order to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, transformation is not a once for all matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is something that takes a life time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every day the indwelling Christ is transforming us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His indwelling means His transforming.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The purpose of the indwelling is to work Christ into our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need many messages to develop all the things related to the matter of the indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After His transforming work, the Lord will come back, and that will be the advent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time He will transfigure our body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have a spirit, a soul, and a body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our spirit is the organ by which we contact and receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our soul is our very being, and our bodies are formed to contain our being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we believe in the Lord, He comes into our spirit to regenerate our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By this He starts His indwelling within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then by His indwelling He spreads from our spirit to transform our being, which is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the working of Christ into our being in order to transform every part of our soul Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the Lord will return to transfigure our body into His glorious form Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At that time all three parts of our entire being will be exactly the same as He is 1 John 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we will express Him in a corporate way for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE MISSING OF THE INDWELLING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Most Christians know something of the incarnation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They also know something of the death, resurrection, ascension, and second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many are confused about the baptism of Christ, but we cannot go into this matter at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We would suggest that you obtain a copy of the booklet, The Baptism in the Holy Spirit from the Living Stream Ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some Christians are clear about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But very, very few Christians know something in an experiential way of the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The indwelling of Christ is the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even some so-called deeper life Christians have never realized much of the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if we do not realize and experience the indwelling of Christ, there is no way to enter into the deeper life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The deeper life is not speaking in tongues or some kind of manifestation of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It should be the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ comes into our spirit, and by His indwelling He is working every day to saturate every part of our being with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the deeper life, and this is the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is indeed sad that today the most strategic matters of Christian experience are fully missed by most Christians.</S>
