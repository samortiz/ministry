   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Legs</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eating the legs of the lamb is a reminder to us that we need to eat Christ in His walk on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eating the legs strengthens us to walk out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Leaving Egypt required strong legs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The children of Israel did not pursue a direct route.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They curved around before reaching the shores of the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then, when they looked behind, they found the Egyptians in hot pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On either side of them were mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Any way of escape seemed completely cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How they needed the wisdom from eating the head of the lamb and the walking strength from eating its legs!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was the source of their strength for walking on dry land through the Red Sea, with its waters a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Inward Parts</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The last part of the lamb the children of Israel were told to eat was its inward parts translated purtenance .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The inward parts of Christ are His emotion, mind, will, and heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to learn to read the four Gospels with a view to eating Christ in His wisdom, walk, and inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By eating Him in this way, He will be to us not only wisdom and strength to escape the snare of the world but also the patience, the long-suffering, and the strong will to sustain us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Unleavened Bread</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lamb was not the only food eaten at the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unleavened bread was one of the accompaniments.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Corinthians 5:8 says, "Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eating Christ as the unleavened bread keeps away all the sinful things, making us also unleavened, with nothing about us unclean in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Bitter Herbs</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"With bitter herbs shall they eat it" Exo 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was the other accompaniment to the lamb, all together making a well-rounded meal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The effect of eating Christ as the bitter herbs is the bitter sense you have whenever you touch something sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you go to a movie, or criticize your mother-in-law, or even think negatively about her, you will sense the bitter herbs working within you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe that by now we are all clear that the way to get out of the coffin and out of Egypt is by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This the provision of the Passover makes apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even the manner of eating the Passover shows how closely it was related to their imminent departure.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord's passover" 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was not a leisurely, relaxing meal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They were on the alert, one hand grasping their staff and the other the pieces of roast lamb to be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus they partook of the Passover, ready at a moment's notice to make their exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>CELEBRATING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once the children of Israel were out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, they praised the Lord by singing and even dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances" Exo 15:1, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How was this glorious triumph accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By the blood there was a complete redemption, and by the eating of the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs there was a perfect exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus have we too been redeemed from God's condemnation and released from Satan's tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hallelujah for what the eating accomplishes!</S>
