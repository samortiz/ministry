   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the meeting is over, you should stay with them to lead them to pray and to talk with them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You should always bring them before the Lord, lead them to pray and receive Him, and then help them record their names.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When recording their names, you need to make sure the street address and the house number are correct.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the past many report slips had wrong house numbers, so a great deal of effort was wasted when we tried to visit them later.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If possible, add a question such as, "When are you most free?'' or "When is the most convenient time for you?''</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you record their names, you should write them down quickly so that the new ones will not be annoyed by your slow writing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the report slips are completed, you have to turn them in to the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Afterward, other brothers can visit them to share more with them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Imparting the Need, the Knowledge,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>and the Decisiveness into People</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people receive the Lord because they have a need, but they do not have the knowledge of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Others have the knowledge of the gospel, but they do not have a need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Still others feel that they have a need and also the knowledge, but they cannot make the decision at that very moment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All these are matters that you need to work on.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To those who do not have a need, you have to impart the need.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To those who do not have the knowledge, you have to impart the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To those who lack decisiveness, you have to impart decisiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Telling Them about Baptism</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After you have brought them to the point where they are quite clear, you need to immediately tell them about baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have to visit them once, twice, or three times; how many times, we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you get to the point that they can be baptized, you should then turn them over to the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before the Meeting Starts</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Another matter presents a very difficult problem when attending a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before the meeting starts, we see five or ten rows of people just sitting there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some might have come one hour early.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are two places in which the passage of time is particularly long: one is hell and the other is the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a person goes to hell, he feels that the time there is very long.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When an unsaved person comes to a church meeting, he also feels that the time there is very long.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is not saved and he feels that the time is long.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He may come quite a while before the preaching of the gospel starts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he leaves, he does not feel right, and if he just sits there, he feels like he is in a fog.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This hour of waiting is very unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes I do have a deep feeling concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I saw some who brought new ones to the meeting and had them sit there row by row, waiting for some period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some had to wait for half an hour, some an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you looked at their faces, they were just like those whom the Lord Jesus saw, who were "cast away like sheep not having a shepherd'' Matt 9:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What do you expect them to do?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you ask them to go home and come back again, there is not enough time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you have them sit there and wait, they have nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, before the meeting starts, you also need to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Never allow the unbelievers to sit together by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From the very beginning you should always seat two or four of them next to one believer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The ones who do this work must be equipped with full armor by having tracts, printed gospel messages, and Bibles ready for the literate to read, and they have to talk to those who cannot read well or are illiterate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In any case all the brothers and sisters should be there taking care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you let them sit there without anything to do, they will become cold even if they were like hot water at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, you have to learn to sit among them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All Becoming Priests</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is no way for this work to be done without everyone serving.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You need to show the brothers and sisters that everyone is a priest; hence, everyone should have things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If this is the case, immediately you will see that all the gospel meetings in every place will be quite prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the church preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must pay special attention to this word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is the church that is preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the brothers and sisters are working; they all are priests and they all have come to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If this is not the case, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>So do not boast that you have the local church in such and such a place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Where is the church today?</S>
