<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. By Taking Christ as the Lamb of God<br>Who Takes Away the Sin of the World</H2><P>To receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ, we must take Him as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (1:29, 36). Christ's being the Lamb of God is one of the deep items in the Gospel of John. The Lamb of God, no doubt, is Jesus, yet He is certainly not a lamb with four legs and a tail. Jesus was called the Lamb of God because in the eyes of God He was the sacrifice, the offering, for the sin of the world. The world here is a composition of the people of the world. The people who constitute the world are sinful, and the world as the composition of these people also is sinful. According to Isaiah 53:7, Christ was led like a lamb to the slaughter. All the people who dealt with Him at the time of His crucifixion led Him like a lamb to the cross, the place of slaughter. On the cross God collected all our sins and put the totality of sin upon Him. Thus, in the eyes of God, He became the Lamb of God. Through His death He took away the sin of the world. When we believe into Christ as the Lamb of God, we gain Christ. This is the basic way to take Christ and to enjoy Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. By Following Christ as Messiah<br>(God's Anointed One)</H2><P>To receive, experience, and enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, we must follow Christ as Messiah (John 1:37, 40-41, 43-45). The word Messiah in Hebrew is the equivalent of the word Christ in Greek. Christ means "the anointed One," and the anointed One is also the appointed One. We must follow the One who has been appointed and anointed by God to be the Executor of God's economy. We need to realize that the very Jesus whom we are following is the Messiah, God's elected One, His chosen One, the One anointed and appointed by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. By Being Born Anew of the Spirit</H2><P>To receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ, we need to be born anew of the Spirit (John 3:3, 5-6). John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." This verse indicates that to be born again is altogether a matter of the two spirits, God the Spirit and our spirit. We were born again not in our physical body but in our spirit, not of blood or flesh but of the Spirit of God. Our human spirit was born of God's Spirit. To be born again is a very subjective way for us to gain Christ for our enjoyment.</P><P>The entire Gospel of John is on the enjoyment of Christ by the Spirit. Without the Spirit we do not have the way to enjoy Christ. Receiving, experiencing, and enjoying Christ are absolutely related to our spirit and the Spirit of God. Before being born again, the Spirit and our spirit were separated and far apart. But through regeneration, the two spirits have been brought together as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Through this one spirit we have the way to receive, enjoy, and experience Christ.</P>
