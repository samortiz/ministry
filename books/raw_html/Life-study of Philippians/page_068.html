	<h2 class="head1">WALKING BY THE BASIC PRINCIPLE</h2><p>In verse 16 the Greek word for <i>walk</i> is <i>stoicheo,</i> which means to walk orderly. It is derived from <i>steicho,</i> which means to range in regular line, to march in military rank, to keep step, to conform to virtue and piety, as used in Romans 4:12; Galatians 5:25; 6:16. It is different from the word <i>walk</i> in Philippians 3:17 and 18, which means to live, to deport oneself, to be occupied with, to walk about, as used in Romans 6:4; 8:4; 13:13; 1 Corinthians 3:3; Galatians 5:16; and Ephesians 4:1, 17. By this word the apostle charges us to walk and order our lives by the same rule, in the same line, in the same path, in the same footsteps, whereunto we have attained, at the state to which we have attained. Whatever state we have attained to in our spiritual life, we all must walk by the same rule, in the same path, as the apostle did; that is, to pursue Christ toward the goal that we may gain Him to the fullest extent as the prize of God&rsquo;s calling from above.</p><p>The Greek word <i>stoicheo</i> is a verbal form of the noun which means &ldquo;element.&rdquo; We do not have an English equivalent for this word. In English we can use <i>element</i> as a noun, but not as a verb. One version adopts the rendering &ldquo;observe the elements.&rdquo; This conveys much of the original meaning; however, I do not care to use the word <i>observe</i> here. Perhaps the Greek should be rendered &ldquo;walk according to the elementary principles,&rdquo; since the meaning is that the elementary principles become our walk. Among the ancient Greeks, there were, as there are today, societies or organizations which followed certain basic principles. There are also basic principles, basic elements, involved in being a Christian. These elements should become a Christian&rsquo;s walk. This was Paul&rsquo;s concept in using this particular word for <i>walk</i> in 3:16.</p><p>We have pointed out that this word is derived from a word which means to range in regular line or march in military rank. Paul uses this term in Romans 4:12, where he speaks of &ldquo;those who walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham.&rdquo; To walk in the steps of Abraham&rsquo;s faith is to conform to his faith, to conform ourselves to certain virtue or piety. This Greek word is very rich in meaning.</p><h2 class="head1">GAINED BY CHRIST TO GAIN CHRIST</h2><p>Paul&rsquo;s main thought in 3:16 is that, as Christians, the most important principle of our Christian life should be to pursue Christ. Pursuing Christ, therefore, should be the major principle according to which we walk. Paul has already indicated this in verse 12 by saying that he pursues in order to lay hold of that for which he has also been laid hold of by Christ Jesus. According to this verse, the principle of our conversion and salvation is that we have been gained by Christ in order to gain Him. This principle must become a basic and governing element in our Christian walk.</p><p>Unfortunately, many of today&rsquo;s Christians do not follow this governing principle. Instead of pursuing God&rsquo;s unique goal, they seek other things. For example, those in the Pentecostal movement or charismatic movement may seek power or spiritual gifts. They may pursue speaking in tongues, healing, or manifestations of other gifts. Those who have such pursuits are not following the basic principle of the Christian life. This principle is to pursue Christ that we may gain Him.</p><p>Christ has gained us not that we may gain gifts, but that we may gain Him. In one of his best hymns, A. B. Simpson says:</p><p class="hbody">Once it was the blessing,<br />Now it is the Lord...<br />Once His gift I wanted,<br />Now, the Giver own;<br />Once I sought for healing,<br />Now Himself alone.<br />(<i>Hymns,</i> #513)</p><p>As this hymn indicates, the governing principle of the Christian life is not gifts or healing&mdash;it is Christ Himself. Realizing this, A. B. Simpson also put out a tract on this theme entitled &ldquo;Himself.&rdquo;</p>
