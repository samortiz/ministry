<h2 class="head1">WHAT TO DO AFTER THE GOSPEL MEETING</h2><h2 class="head2">Taking Down Their Names</h2><p>The end of the message is not the end of the story; there are still many things to do. The most important thing is to collect the names of all the gospel friends. These are our leads for future visitation. Other items need to be put back in order. The pens have to be gathered together in bags and placed in one place. The seats and the hall must be cleaned and properly rearranged.</p><h2 class="head2">Visitation</h2><p>After a man has heard the gospel, someone needs to visit him. The work of visitation should be done as soon as possible. The sooner we visit, the better the result. Appointment of visitation can be done in the districts. It is best to finish the arrangement by Sunday (i.e., the same day that the gospel is preached) and to visit them that same afternoon. On Monday evening the brothers and sisters can come together for fellowship. There are two kinds of visitations: one in which all the brothers and sisters participate, and a special kind of visitation that should be done by specific people assigned by the church.</p><h2 class="head1">GOSPEL TEAMS</h2><p>Not only must we invite people to come to the meeting hall to hear the gospel; we must organize gospel teams to bring the gospel to others. Indoor gospel preaching is for drawing people. Outdoor gospel teams are for bringing the gospel to people. The Lord commanded the disciples to "go therefore and disciple all the nations" (Matt. 28:19). The church in Hong Kong should organize gospel teams to go out to preach the gospel. This is not only good for exercising the gospel spirit; it will bring many to salvation who otherwise cannot come to us. In Taiwan a person about to board a train saw men running after the gospel teams. He was curious, and he ran with them. In the end he was saved. Seventy percent of the saved ones in Taipei are college students. Many are out-of-town students who have come to Taipei for their education. When we send the gospel teams to the streets, we can gain those who are away from home. If we only preach the gospel indoors, the number of people saved will be very limited.</p><p>In order to organize gospel teams, we need manpower and money. We need to have trumpets, accordions, drums, banners, armbands, and T-shirts for these teams. We also need some to play the instruments, beat the drums, and shout the slogans. Our gospel teams in Taipei are big in number. We have an inner circle of ushers and an outer circle of ushers. The inner circle of ushers is responsible for sitting down and talking to the friends. The outer circle of ushers is responsible for attracting people to come to listen. Some preach the gospel on the street corners. They kneel down with people and help them to pray and repent. This brings some to tears.</p><p>Outdoor gospel preaching can build up our gospel spirit. In Nanking, one brother was a carpenter. One day he put on a gospel T-shirt. On the front was the word sin, and on the back was the word death. He passed out tracts on the street and exhorted men to believe in the Lord. Others considered him odd, but he led people to kneel down and pray on the spot. He brought many to salvation this way.</p><h2 class="head1">PASSING OUT GOSPEL TRACTS</h2><p>In Hong Kong we should be passing out gospel tracts, putting up gospel banners, and making gospel billboards everywhere. If possible, we should install gospel neon signs. Today the businessmen put up advertisements everywhere. Their goal is to make money. If we Christians do not put up gospel advertisements, it is to our shame. The merchants advertise in order to make money. We advertise for the gospel in order to gain men's souls, that others may receive the benefit of the gospel freely (1 Cor. 9:23). History tells us that the newspaper was first used by Christians. But today Christians have abandoned it. This is a pity. I hope that some will receive a burden from the Lord to give themselves to the service of gospel advertisement.</p>
