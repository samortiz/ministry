<h1 class="title">BEING WATCHFUL AND READY<br />
AND BEING FAITHFUL AND DILIGENT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 24:37-42, 44, 51; 25:1-30</h1>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE WORD OF GRACE<br />
AND THE WORD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>
<p>All Christians love Scripture verses such as John 3:16, which says, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life&rdquo;; Matthew 1:21, which says, &ldquo;You shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins&rdquo;; and 11:28, which says, &ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; They also love the nine blessings in Matthew 5. However, not many Christians appreciate the word in Matthew 24 and 25.</p>
<p>Matthew 24 and 25 speak of slaves and virgins. Regardless of whether we are brothers or sisters, we are virgins as well as slaves before God. Just as we acknowledge that believing in the Lord and being saved are important, we must also acknowledge that the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 24 and 25 is important. Just as we love the words &ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest,&rdquo; we should also remember the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 24 and 25 concerning the Lord settling accounts with us when He returns.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EVIL SLAVE AND THE FOOLISH VIRGINS<br />
BEING TRUE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Matthew 24:51 says that the Lord will cut asunder the evil slave. The Brethren taught that only false believers will be cut asunder. They maintained that the Lord Jesus would not cut asunder a believer who was redeemed with His blood. Therefore, they said that the five foolish virgins and the evil and slothful slave in chapter 25 are false believers. This teaching gave rise to many disputes.</p>
<p>In John 10:28-29 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father...is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; Based on these verses, the Brethren taught that once we are saved, our salvation is eternally secure; therefore, they argued that genuine believers could not be cut asunder or shut outside the door. However, those who know the Bible know that the Lord would not set a false believer over His household and that a false believer cannot go forth to meet the Bridegroom with a lighted lamp. Hence, we should not say that the foolish virgins are false believers. A father with several children would never say that the clever ones are his real children, but the foolish ones are false children. In the same principle, we should not say that someone is a false slave simply because he is evil and slothful.</p>
<p>In Matthew 13:24-30 the Lord said that the enemy sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and that the tares and the wheat are growing together. The tares are false believers, and the Lord is waiting until the end of the age to weed out the tares, bind them into bundles, and burn them. In chapter 25, however, the virgins die and then are resurrected. The virgins are resurrected believers who are raptured to the Lord&rsquo;s judgment seat to render an account to the Lord. A false believer would not be raptured to the Lord&rsquo;s judgment seat to give an account to the Lord. Therefore, the prudent virgins are true believers, and the foolish virgins are also true believers. The good and faithful slaves are true believers, and the evil and slothful slaves are also true believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO BE CUT ASUNDER MEANING TO BE CUT OFF<br />
FROM OUR FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 24 and 25, we will either receive a reward from the Lord or be cut asunder by Him in the future. The phrase <em>cut asunder</em> means &ldquo;to cut apart.&rdquo; In John 15 the Lord said that He is the true vine, we are the branches, and He will take away any branch that does not bear fruit (vv. 1-2, 5). According to our experience and knowledge of the truth, the Lord cuts off from the vine tree any branch that does not bear fruit. He does not simply cut the branch in two.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 1:21 says, &ldquo;The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.&rdquo; When we were baptized, we entered into an organic union with the Lord. When we fellowship with Him, touch His presence, and enjoy His riches, we are one with Him. Sometimes, however, we are separated from the Lord because we commit sin. Even though the Lord has not cut us off, we feel as if our fellowship with the Lord has been cut off.</p>
<p>As believers our union with the Lord is eternal. However, if we are evil and slothful, the Lord will cut us off from His presence when He returns. Concerning the evil slave the master says that he &ldquo;will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth&rdquo; (Matt. 24:51). Concerning the good and faithful slave the master says, &ldquo;You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (25:21). The master then says concerning the evil and slothful slave, &ldquo;Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth&rdquo; (v. 30). According to chapters 24 and 25, to cut the evil slave asunder means to cast him into the outer darkness. This is to cut him off from the Lord&rsquo;s presence and cast him into the outer darkness.</p>
<p>Our union with the Lord is realized through our enjoyment and fellowship. To be cut off means that we lose our fellowship with the Lord and our enjoyment of the Lord. This is a punishment, but it is not eternal perdition. A person may say to his children that whoever receives good grades will receive a reward at the end of the semester, and whoever fails will be punished by being restricted to his room. When the semester is over, the child who receives an A receives a reward, but the child who fails is restricted to his room. Whether he is in his room for half a day or for one hour, while he is in the room, he is cut off from his father&rsquo;s presence. His being shut in his room is a kind of cutting off. It temporarily cuts the child off from his relationship with his father. In the same principle, for the sake of God&rsquo;s righteous ways, for His government, and for our benefit, we will be cut off from the Lord if we are slothful.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Crucial Matters for the Increase and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
