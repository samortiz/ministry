<h2 class="head2">The Man-child Being Strong to War against Satan<br />
for the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>Matthew 22 says, &ldquo;Many are called but few are chosen&rdquo; (v. 14). There are many believers throughout the ages, but only a minority of them are the man-child. Furthermore, the book of Revelation shows that Satan&rsquo;s attention is not directed toward the woman but toward the man-child, whom he seeks to devour. This is the real situation today. Although Satan afflicts the church and deals with the church, his darts are always aimed at the strong, overcoming ones&mdash;the man-child&mdash;in the church. Whoever is strong in the church becomes a target of criticism, opposition, and even attack. Revelation 12:5-7 even speaks of there being war in heaven when the man-child is caught up to God and to His throne. The man-child will war for the kingdom of God and cast down Satan and his angels (vv. 7-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cause of the Man-child&rsquo;s Victory over Satan</h2>
<p>Revelation 12:11 says, &ldquo;They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death.&rdquo; <em>They</em> in this verse refers to the man-child, the brothers who overcame Satan. Verse 10 speaks of Satan accusing the brothers before our God day and night. The brothers, however, overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, because of the word of their testimony, and because they did not love their soul-life even unto death. We can overcome Satan because the blood of the Lamb has redeemed us, because of the word of our testimony, and because we do not love our soul-life, our self, even unto death. Concerning negative things, the man-child will cast down God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, from heaven. Concerning positive things, the man-child will bring in the kingdom of God. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ.&rdquo; The man-child casts down Satan and brings in the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Man-child Being the Bride in Revelation 19</h2>
<p>The man-child in chapter 12 of Revelation becomes the bride in chapter 19. The overcoming believers who constitute the man-child will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb (vv. 7-9). Not every saved person will attend this marriage dinner. This dinner, which lasts one thousand years, is only for the overcomers. All those who are saved will be in the New Jerusalem in eternity future, but not everyone will be part of the bride. Nor will everyone be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. We must be today&rsquo;s man-child, the overcomers, to be part of the bride in that day and to enjoy the marriage dinner of the Lamb. In the coming millennial kingdom the overcomers will eat and rejoice together with Christ, enjoy His presence and joy, and enter into the full enjoyment of Him for one thousand years.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Becoming the Man-child to Defeat the Enemy,<br />
Bring In the Kingdom, and Accomplish God&rsquo;s Purpose</h2>
<p>From Genesis to the end of Revelation God has a purpose, which must be accomplished through man. In this matter the first man, Adam, failed. Then the Lord Jesus became the second man to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose. Through His death and resurrection, the one new man was produced, which is the church as the third man. This new man should have been able to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose, but the church failed. Therefore, God came in to call out overcomers from the church. These overcomers are the man-child. Only the man-child, composed of overcoming saints, can defeat and cast down God&rsquo;s enemy, bring Christ back, bring in the kingdom of the Lord, and accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Wherever the overcomers go, Satan is cast down and Christ is brought in. Hence, the kingdom of God, in which Satan is defeated and Christ is expressed, is with the overcomers. These overcomers are the man-child, the fourth man in the Bible.</p>
