   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After man was made by God, God saw what He had made and used the words very good to describe it Gen 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But this very good man became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most people think that if Adam had not fallen, he and we would not have needed to be regenerated, but this is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if man had never fallen, he would still have needed to be reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The God-created man needed to be reborn of God, not just to have God's breath of life, but to have God's life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man needed regeneration even if man had never fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God in His economy planned it this way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Old Testament tells us that Saul was anointed by God and got another heart 1 Sam 10:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A new heart is obviously something new, but another heart may still be the old heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Saul did not have something new.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God created an old man, and this old man should have a transformation, a change from the old to the new.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The old man was human; the new man is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all have to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we are wonderful persons because we have been regenerated with God's divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are now both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God was incarnated, He could say, "I am a God-man."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now that we have been regenerated, we can say, "I am a man-God."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The only difference is this: He had the divine life first.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then He received the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We had the human life first.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we received the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, God has two lives with two natures, and we are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ was born to give us a second birth, that is, to make us God in His life and nature, but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God was made a man, and we men are being made God, but without the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is a two-way traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He comes with divinity to enter into humanity, and we go with humanity to enter into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the significance of regeneration according to the blueprint, the plan, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By His mercy God has really shown us His plan, His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The main line we have seen in God's plan is that God intended to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is His hobby, His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What does God want?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God wants to get a man for Him to be one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason why He loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So first, He created a man, and this creation of man can be considered as a begetting of man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Four thousand years later, He came to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was not separate from man, but He became a man in union with man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God came to be a man to give us a second birth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God can do everything, but if He had not become a man, He could not regenerate man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He must have the qualification of being God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He became a man in His incarnation to put on humanity, and this part of Him, the human part, was not divine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>While He was on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, He was part divine and part human.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In His incarnation He put on man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then He took the second step to die and resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In resurrection He "sonized" His human part, making this human part divine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Obviously, we were born human.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then God as the prototype came into us as the divine One.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now it will take our whole life for Him to transform our humanity into something divine.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This transformation is the process of "sonizing" us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In one sense, we are now the sons of God because we have been begotten of God with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But in our attitude, actions, and behavior we may appear as the sons of beggars.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This shows that in another sense, we do not appear to be the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should say, "I am a son of God in life and nature, but not yet fully in constitution and appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am being transformed day by day."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we are under God's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To transform us is to sonize us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is God's work in us every day.</S>
