<h2 class="head1">JESUS CHRIST&mdash;THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>Jesus Christ is the mingling of God with man. When He was on this earth, He was both man and God&mdash;He was the God-man. Even today, He is both a genuine man and the very God. God cannot be separated from Him. Once tea is mingled with water, wherever the water is, the tea is also. Just as tea is mingled with water, so also God is mingled with humanity in Christ. Wherever Christ is, God is as well. Stephen&rsquo;s word in Acts 7 proves that even after His ascension into heaven, the Lord Jesus is not only God but also a man: &ldquo;Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God&rdquo; (v. 56). There is a man in the heavens who is the embodiment of God. Before Christ was born in Bethlehem, God and man were separate. At the incarnation, however, God and man were joined as one in Christ. God is no longer merely God&mdash;He in Christ is mingled with man. It is here that the belief of Christians differs from the Jewish belief. According to the Jews, God is merely God <em>(Elohim);</em> Christians believe that this God is not only God but also God incarnated to be a man. Like the Jews, we believe that God is the Creator and the Lord. But unlike them, we believe that Jesus Christ is the Lord. The Lord God and the Lord Jesus are not two Lords but one. Christ Jesus the Lord is the Creator God incarnated to be mingled with man. The Lord Jesus Christ is a man who, on the day of His ascension, was exalted to heaven and established by God to be the Lord. Acts 2:36 says, &ldquo;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified.&rdquo; If Christ were merely God, there would be no need in the Bible for such a verse. However, since Christ is a mingling of God and man, He in His humanity needed to be made the Lord and Christ.</p>
<p>In speaking of Christ being a mingling of God with man, we are not implying that a third nature was produced. Incarnation brought divinity into humanity and made them one entity, but neither divinity nor humanity was changed in nature. No; divinity remains divinity, and humanity remains humanity. This is illustrated by the mingling of oil with fine flour in the meal offering. The oil and the flour are mingled together to form one entity with two natures. However, each nature remains distinct and complete. The oil does not lose its nature, and the flour does not change its nature. Nevertheless, the oil and the flour are mingled together to produce one entity. This entity is not a third nature, something that is neither oil nor flour. Rather, it is a complete entity with two natures, the nature of oil and the nature of flour. This is an illustration of incarnation bringing divinity into humanity, making them one, and causing them to live as one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ was the first mingling of God with man, and everyone who has been reborn and regenerated is a reproduction of Christ as a mingling of God with man. Christians are simply the mingling of God with man. A thorough realization of this vital point will solve all the problems in the Christian life, for every part of the Christian life is in reality a part of the mingling of God with man.</p>
<p>It is crucial to realize that Adam in his pre-fallen state was not a mingling of God with man. After Adam was formed of the dust of the earth, he was only a creature of God&mdash;he was not the mingling of God with man. However, if Adam and Eve had eaten of the tree of life, which was the manifestation of God, they would have been mingled with God. After God created man, God presented Himself in the form of the tree of life to be partaken of by man. However, Satan came in, frustrated man from eating of the tree of life, and seduced him to take the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead. As a result, the tree of life was closed to man by God with cherubim and a flaming sword (Gen. 3:24). This means that the God who is life to man was closed off from man by His glory, holiness, and righteousness. Unless the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness were met, the way for man to touch God as life would remain closed. The separation between God and fallen man is typified also by the veil that separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies in the temple (2 Chron. 3:14). Christ&rsquo;s death met all the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness, and as a result, the veil in the temple was rent, and the way to contact God as life was opened (Matt. 27:51; Heb. 10:19-20). Because He opened the living way, we can boldly come forward in the blood of Jesus to contact God as our life directly.</p>
<p>The God with whom we are mingled is the Triune God Himself&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is the fountain, the Son is the spring, and the Holy Spirit is the stream (Psa. 36:9; John 4:14; 7:37; 2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 22:1). Not only is God flowing out for us to drink of Him as the Spirit; He also created a spirit within us (Zech. 12:1). Consequently, when God as the Spirit flows into us, He flows into our spirit and mingles with our spirit as one spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 testifies of this mingling: &ldquo;But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo;</p>
