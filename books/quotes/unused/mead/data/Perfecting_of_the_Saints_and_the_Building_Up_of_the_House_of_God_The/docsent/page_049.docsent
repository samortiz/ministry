   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Inviting Our Friends, Relatives, and Neighbors</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After a person is saved, he should make a list of his friends, relatives, and acquaintances who are not saved and have not heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He should then pray for them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should all do this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without exception, we should preach the gospel to all our friends, relatives, and neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the church preaches the gospel, the saints have an excellent opportunity to lead their friends and relatives to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the reason that we should make a list of our friends and relatives and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At an appropriate time we should also invite our friends, relatives, and neighbors to a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can use an invitation card printed by the church or a gospel tract.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should even invite our gospel friends for a meal before the gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Otherwise, our friends might not attend the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if we invite them to our home for a meal, we can take them to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They will not be able to make any excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is worthwhile to spend time and money on our gospel friends.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do this, the Holy Spirit will be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to exert some effort for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SERVICE IN A GOSPEL MEETING Learning to Be an Usher</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the gospel meeting some saints should serve as ushers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When people enter the meeting hall, the first ones whom they see are the ushers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A person needs the right demeanor in every situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a wedding we should be joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>People who look miserable and sad in a wedding are an insult to those who are getting married.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes the ushering brothers and sisters are expressionless.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They lack the face of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This hinders people from seeing the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we spend enough time in prayer, we will have the face of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before we serve as an usher, we should pray and deal with the Lord so that we are filled with the spirit of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then there will be no need for others to teach us how to usher.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will smile, greet people, and escort them to their seats in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In everything we do, people will sense the flavor of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not something that we can imitate or be taught.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can have the flavor of the gospel only by being filled with the spirit of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once we are filled with the spirit of the gospel, our face will become the face of the gospel, our greeting will become the greeting of the gospel, and our ushering will be according to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This makes people feel pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They will sense a special flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This flavor cannot be found in a wedding or a party.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This special flavor is the Holy Spirit and is also the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every saint who ushers should have this flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, they often appear cold and stern, as if they are in a court of law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ushers have to pray until their inward being is melted by the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then they will treasure every person who comes to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the sales clerks in the shops on Heng-Yang Street in Taipei warmly welcome the customers who enter their store.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This encourages people to buy things from them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some customers who only planned to buy one thing end up buying more because of the salespeople.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The ushers should also be like this in a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The ushers should make people feel that they must believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The people who see an usher with a gospel face are touched and moved inwardly, before they even hear the gospel or sing a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Their heart is softened.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When people see a cold and stern face, however, they feel cold within and do not want to hear the gospel or sing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>An usher can wound the heart of a new one and hinder him from receiving the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is not a joke.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the ushers need to learn to have a spirit of the gospel through thorough prayer so that they can be proper ushers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Learning to Sit with Our Gospel Friends</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Another service in the gospel meeting is to sit with our gospel friends.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are believers and serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we come to a gospel meeting, we should sit with our gospel friends, not with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is best for every gospel friend to have a saint sitting beside them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The saints should always sit with the gospel friends.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should look for new faces in the meeting and converse with them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps the new ones have heard the gospel many times, or maybe this is their first time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whatever their situation, we can always render some assistance.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not appropriate for the saints to sit together in a gospel meeting, apart from the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to care for the gospel friends.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to learn and be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At the beginning of the gospel meeting, we always sing a few songs.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should help the gospel friends to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we sing, the gospel friend will also sing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not be overzealous or hasty, nor should we be indifferent to the new ones when we sing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This will cause them not to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This will also force the brother leading the singing to ask everyone to sing loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have to learn to be flexible and exercise our spirit when we sit with a gospel friend.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should sing when it is time to sing and be attentive to their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If he sings softly, we should sing softly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If he sings too softly, we should encourage him to sing a little louder.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If he does not sing clearly, we can help him by singing clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This requires much experience.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should not think that this is a light and trivial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I heard of a story thirty years ago about the American evangelist, D. L. Moody, that has helped me preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Once he was speaking with a woman concerning salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As he began to reach a crucial point in his preaching of the gospel, it began to rain.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Shortly thereafter, a sister walked into the room where he was and loudly closed her umbrella.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This noise distracted the woman, and she did not receive the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Mr. Moody said, From that time until now, I have not been able to lead her to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This can also be compared to preparing a Chinese breakfast pastry.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The best pastry is crisp, puffy, full of air, and very thin.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A person who is preparing these pastries must not be interrupted; otherwise, the pastry will be ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Preaching the gospel does not require that we shout.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is a matter of touching people s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Spirit is gentle and cannot be rushed.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When we invite a friend to hear the gospel, we should be gentle with him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Whether we usher or sit with the gospel friends, we have to be sensitive to their future.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Some saints are too zealous and anxious during the singing and prayer time.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They ask the gospel friends to close their eyes or bow their head when it is time to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We should not force our gospel friends to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we want to bow our head and pray, it should not matter whether others bow their head or close their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should be general and not force our friends to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They will be influenced by our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should give them the freedom to follow their own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I once saw a brother repeatedly pat the shoulder of a gospel friend and say that he should bow his head, but it will not do any good for him to bow his head if his spirit is closed.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Our behavior may even annoy him and cause him to not come to another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We should be careful when we sit next to a gospel friend.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We must learn to be sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We also need to consider how we listen to the message in a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Our behavior can distract and disturb the ones sitting next to us.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Sometimes even a cough can distract them.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It can cause people to lose their concentration, and they will be unable to follow the message at a crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Some saints suddenly yawn or sneeze at a key moment in the message.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When a gospel friend is listening attentively and the Holy Spirit is moving and operating within him, the person next to the gospel friend can suddenly stretch his legs or move his chair.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This can frustrate the gospel friend from believing.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Such seemingly small things can make a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Hence, we must be alert when we sit next to a gospel friend.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>While we listen to the message, we should be praying for our gospel friends.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Human beings have a social nature.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If one person laughs, others are affected by the laughter, and if a person cries, others are affected.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If we listen attentively in a gospel meeting, the one next to us will be affected, and if we are touched by the message, he will also be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This is a marvelous phenomenon.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>One time in a meeting the brother sitting in front of me began to shake violently.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Consequently, everyone sitting around him was affected and could not concentrate; I also could not concentrate or write down the words which were being spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Even if some in the meeting were touched by the message, the violent shaking caused them to lose their concentration.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Hence, we should learn how to conduct ourselves in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The brothers who speak from the podium know that those who are listening can affect their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>A brother or sister who is consistently looking around can disrupt the speaker and cause him to lose his train of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>This is inexplicable, but it happens.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We need to learn from this.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>When we listen to a gospel message, we need to be keen to sense the feeling of the gospel friends to see if they are touched by the message or if they may have a question that causes them to reject the message.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We need to learn to observe.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Our observation will help us to speak with them in order to know their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Suppose a gospel friend is subdued by God, and it is clear that he has no problem with the existence of God or the matter of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If this is his situation, we should not waste time on these matters; rather, we should lead him to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>This is the reason that we need to accompany our gospel friends and sit next to them in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>We need to learn this practical lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>At the end of a gospel meeting, sometimes the speaker asks the gospel friends to respond by standing up, raising their hand, or bowing their head to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Some saints think that it does not matter whether the gospel friends respond.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>They consider that this should depend on the Holy Spirit only.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>They assume that if the Holy Spirit operates, the gospel friends will respond, but if the Holy Spirit is not working, they will not respond.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>They think that they cannot influence their gospel friends response.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>This is not a proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>However, there are also brothers and sisters who are too zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>If a gospel friend is unwilling to stand, they push him to stand up.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>It may be that he was willing to stand up with a little encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>However, if he is pushed too much, he will become offended and not stand up.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>We need to be sensitive to the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>The willingness of a gospel friend to stand up and respond has much to do with the saint sitting next to him.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>If we are proper, the gospel friend often will listen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Toward the end of 1941 I preached the gospel in a meeting, and a middle-aged woman was in the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Her husband was saved and had even begun a meeting in that town.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Many of his colleagues and their wives were also saved, but his wife loved the pleasures of the world and enjoyed going to movies, playing mah-jongg, and having parties.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>She was not happy that her husband was saved and no longer lived according to his old manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Consequently, she was unwilling to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>When the brother invited some brothers to his home for a meal, she even served cold leftovers.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>This brother and his wife lived in a dormitory provided by the Chinese Customs Office.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>His colleagues, who also lived in the same dormitory, invited and urged the wife to attend a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>In the meeting all the saints were praying for her and saw the working of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>She listened to the message, and when it was time to respond, she could not sit still on her seat.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Her youngest daughter, who accompanied her to the meeting, helped her respond.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>She said to her mother, Mom, I will stand up for you.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Eventually the mother stood up.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>This example demonstrates the usefulness of sitting with gospel friends.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>Not long after the wife was saved, she invited some saints to her home for a hot meal.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>Their household received much grace.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>This shows that in a gospel meeting we must learn to observe the reactions of the people whom we sit next to and respond appropriately.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Everything we do should be spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>If, at the appropriate time, we need to nod our head and help someone to stand up, we need to do it with grace.</S>
