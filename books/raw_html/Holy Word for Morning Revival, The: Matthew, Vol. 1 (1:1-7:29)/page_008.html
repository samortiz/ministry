<p class="bold">WEEK 1 — PROPHECY</p><h2 class="uhead1">Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The King’s antecedents and status (1:1—2:23)	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>His genealogy and office—called Christ (1:1-17)</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class="uhead1">Crucial Points</h2><p>The Bible is God’s speaking. In the Old Testament, God spoke by the prophets, and in the New Testament, He spoke in the Son, in the person of the Son (Heb. 1:1-2). With this wonderful person there are many aspects. Matthew testifies that He is the King. Mark tells us that He is the Servant of God. Luke presents Him as the only proper and normal man to be the Savior of mankind, and John unveils Him as the Son of God, the very God Himself, who is life to God’s people.</p><p>Among the four Gospels only two, Matthew and Luke, have genealogies. Matthew tells us that Jesus is the proper descendant of the royal family, that He is the legal heir of the royal throne. Luke presents Jesus as a proper, normal man, which also requires a genealogy.</p><p>When we come to the genealogy of Jesus in Matthew we need to realize who Jesus is. This genealogy calls Him the son of David and the son of Abraham. Jesus is the mingling of God with man, the mingling of divinity with humanity. This is the generation of Jesus. In this generation we have the mingling of the divine Being with so many human beings.</p><p>The kingdom, of which Christ is the King, is composed of Abraham’s descendants, including both his descendants in the flesh and those in faith. Hence, the genealogy of Christ in Matthew begins with Abraham, the father of the called race, not with Adam, the father of the created race. The genealogy of Christ includes all kinds of people: good ones, bad ones, called ones, fallen ones, and recovered ones. From the lives of all these persons, we can discover certain principles that govern our association with Christ. No matter what we are or where we came from, we can be included in the generation of Christ if we fulfill the principles.</p><p>In Christ we need, first, the life of Abraham. We need to forget what we are, live by Christ, and trust in Him. Second, in Christ, we have no need of Ishmael, our doing; we need Isaac, His doing. Further, we do not need the supplanting, striving, natural Jacob, but the transformed Israel, realizing that it is absolutely due to the Lord’s mercy that we have been selected to be associated with Christ. We continue with Boaz. He redeemed Ruth as well as the birthright for her. Daily, we should take care of others’ birthright and enjoyment of Christ, not only our own. Next is Ruth. As Ruth, if we have a heart that seeks after God and God’s people, then we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ. Following Ruth, through Jesse we see that Christ must be our source and our issue. Proceeding to Jesse’s son, David, we see that living in resurrection will often require us to be the end of one situation and the beginning of another. Finally, Solomon was the issue of man’s transgression and repentance plus God’s forgiveness. The church is always built up by this kind of person.</p><p>All the generations were directed toward Christ and brought forth Christ. Christ is the forty-second generation. Forty-two signifies rest and satisfaction after trials. Without Christ, there are just forty-one generations; there is no goal, no consummation, and no conclusion. Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations, fulfilling their prophecies, solving their problems, and meeting their needs. He is everything to us. Hallelujah, Christ has come!</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p>
