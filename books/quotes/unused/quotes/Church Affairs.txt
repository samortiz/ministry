In the Bible the work of the deacons is altogether for service; besides service they have no other responsibility
In Protestant Christianity the Episcopal Church likes to use this English word ministry; the Methodist Church likes to use the word service
All the saints are deacons, but only those who are reliable and who have spiritual weight can be set up as deacons formally
Some brothers or sisters are especially gifted in doing things, and you would often like to set them up to be deacons
Especially in selecting deacons do not look only for those who do things diligently but also for those who have the proper ways to do things
By all means you should consider whether or not a person indeed has spiritual understanding in the Lord and has value on the spiritual side
Otherwise, worldly means, worldly ways, and worldly skills in doing things will often be brought into the church
Even though things may be handled very smoothly, for the church to be changed into a society by this one will cause a serious problem
The office of the elder is for the purpose of taking care of the church, that is, for administrating the church
The elders belong to the side of the office of the church and are altogether for executing, administrating, and overseeing the whole church
Because he is a minister of the word before God being apt to teach and an elder of the church at the same time he is worthy of double honor
In addition, they need God-given abilities and gifts so that they can take care of the affairs of the church and administrate them
Of course, it is best for him to have both aspects: to know the spiritual things and also to be able to handle practical affairs
Only one who has a way in spiritual things and who can also manage his household can be an elder and administrate the church of God
After you have three, five, seven, or eight such people, you still have to examine them in the aspect of managing practical affairs
He had very little understanding in spiritual things, if any, and he was even more lacking in spiritual experience
He himself had never confessed his sins or wept to such an extent, so naturally he considered it funny when he saw someone weeping one day
To weep for your sins is an elementary matter in spiritual life, but this brother did not understand this at all
Such a one feels that all the spiritual things are strange and laughable and cannot comprehend one spiritual thing at all
As to the requirements for an elder, the first relates to spiritual things, to spiritual understanding, and to spiritual experience
If he goes to work in a hospital, at the most you can ask him to handle practical affairs, but you cannot ask him to be the chief physician
When you make a selection, pay attention to the spiritual aspect first, and then pay attention to the practical aspect
Paul charged these two young apostles, Timothy and Titus, to appoint elders in the churches and to guide them in their serving
If you have time to read these Epistles, you will see that Paul charged Timothy and Titus to work together with the elders in the church
Rather, after you have appointed elders in a locality, you need to observe how they go on, and you need to help them
Every time their attitude becomes loose or light, you need to say, 'Brothers, this is a spiritual matter, and this is something before God
In such a case, you should tell them, 'Brothers, among God's children we do not manipulate, nor do we maneuver
Starting in the morning, everyone brought his food and labored together to pray and consider every item of the things in the church
Perhaps we may not have that much time; then at least once a week the leading brothers should meet together for half a day or a few hours
During the first half of the meeting , the elders should close their doors and not care for anything else but the affairs of the church
Sometimes you can also have discussions like those in 1 Corinthians 14 to fellowship the light that you have received
In the Bible there are discussions in order to deal with things, but discussion is for seeking light and not for making decisions
When you go out to work, it would be a big mistake if you could not cause all the brothers to come forth to serve
By no means should you work in a way that only you yourself know how to bear responsibility, yet you are not able to help others do so
Paul did not leave Titus in Crete and Timothy in Ephesus and tell them to return after they established elders
Always put yourself in the midst of the responsible brothers and help them to the extent that they can bear responsibility
After the affairs are taken care of, go and inform the deacons that certain matters need to be taken care of this week
Certain matters are to be announced to the saints, and certain matters should be assigned to the brothers for them to carry out
In handling the affairs of the church, you must be able to manage first and know how to watch and oversee second
Charge them to shut themselves inside during this period for two or three hours before God and not receive any brother nor talk about anyone
During this time, if the brothers and sisters want to look for the elders of the church, they will be able to find them
In that meeting you should show the responsible brothers how to deal with affairs and what scriptural basis you have to deal in such a way
You should give yourself to a number of people, and they in turn should give themselves to all the brothers and sisters
You need to show the elders that no matter how hard they try, they are too few to be able to handle the affairs of the church properly
After the brothers have taken care of many situations before God, the second half of the meeting is the time to receive the saints
Answer: You can ask the few brothers whom you feel are promising and let them first learn to bear responsibility
After a period of time, perhaps two or three months, you can place them in the office of the eldership or of a deacon
To make a change with a deacon is still a relatively easy matter, but to make a change with an elder is not easy at all
The issue is spiritual; therefore, you need to be very careful before God, and lead these brothers into this realm
To some brothers we may say, 'You can be a responsible brother,' and to some others we may say, 'You can be a deacon'
If a person is humble, it would not do much damage, but once human feeling comes in, it is a very difficult situation
Today if a brother comes from T'ai-yuan and attends this meeting, it is a very great privilege we extend to him
When you go to visit the second time, you should be clear whether or not that brother can bear the responsibility
To take care of the church is more serious than Moses going up to the mountain to receive two tablets of stone
Only when it is strong do you have the way to make the churches in the surrounding area strong and bring them into the presence of the Lord
When you come into this meeting, you should say, 'We are handling things before God and should not have a loose attitude'
Unnecessary words should be reduced, for if they abound, two or three hours will slip away and all your time will be gone
If you have a feeling or something to say, you should bring it up in the meeting of the overseers when all the brothers are together
If someone does not speak in the meeting of the overseers, yet goes out and speaks to others, he is a person with a double tongue
You must rebuke him sharply, saying, 'Brother, this is not the way a Christian behaves, nor is it becoming to a saint
As to how this matter was decided and handled in the meeting of the overseers, it is better that these words be buried in the grave
With more time your sense should become keener and keener, and you will be able to know what will happen and what will not happen
You should learn to bear the breastplate every day, and then you will discover something concerning God's people every day
If the gospel meeting has become weak, we need to concentrate all our strength there, and the saints need to do likewise
They will know that this day or this half a day is the time the responsible brothers go before God to take care of things
When the door of this little study was shut, all the sons knew that their father had gone before God to deal with things
We should also let all the saints know that the day the responsible brothers deal with things before God is a designated day
When we come to this meeting, it is not a matter of how well we know each other, for this is the time we truly go before God
When our condition is right and the brothers come together, it will be a simple matter without much difficulty
We may let those who come to learn from out of town go back after two or three months and do their work properly
With this principle in view, let us see how we can lead all the brothers and sisters to be priests in a local church
In the beginning in Foochow and also in Shanghai, we arranged a few matters which were to be done by all the local brothers and sisters
There is the care for the brothers and sisters who have moved away and for those who have moved from other places
In other words, those who are evangelists should preach the gospel, and those who are not evangelists should do the work of an evangelist
If God has given you the gift to be an evangelist, then you should concentrate on preaching the gospel to bring people into the church
If you are not established by God as an evangelist, the Lord's word is that all of God's children should do the work of an evangelist
In other words, concerning the work of preaching the gospel, he who can do it should do it, and he who cannot do it should also do it
For this we have to encourage all the brothers and sisters to spend time going out to do the work of preaching the gospel
We should never allow them to be lazy and forget about sinners and should never allow just a few to do the work of preaching the gospel
It should be made known to all the brothers and sisters that everyone is a priest and that everyone should serve God
They should keep bringing him until he has been led to know the Lord, has received the Lord, and has been baptized
You need to ask the responsible brothers to make arrangements for a few brothers and sisters to help care for them
He said that once a British preacher went to Japan and was preaching in a very large public area on a day when many people were there
You need to sit next to these new ones, perhaps two or four of them, to listen with them, even though you did not bring them
Those who have not brought anyone should also learn to take care of the people that others have brought to the meeting
As the gospel is being preached while you are sitting next to people, according to your feeling the time may or may not be ripe
If the person is ripe, you need to encourage him to believe; if he is not ripe, you still need to encourage him to believe
You should always bring them before the Lord, lead them to pray and receive Him, and then help them record their names
In the past many report slips had wrong house numbers, so a great deal of effort was wasted when we tried to visit them later
When you record their names, you should write them down quickly so that the new ones will not be annoyed by your slow writing
Still others feel that they have a need and also the knowledge, but they cannot make the decision at that very moment
After you have brought them to the point where they are quite clear, you need to immediately tell them about baptism
When you get to the point that they can be baptized, you should then turn them over to the responsible brothers
There are two places in which the passage of time is particularly long: one is hell and the other is the church meeting
If you looked at their faces, they were just like those whom the Lord Jesus saw, who were 'cast away like sheep not having a shepherd'
If you let them sit there without anything to do, they will become cold even if they were like hot water at the beginning
If this is the case, immediately you will see that all the gospel meetings in every place will be quite prevailing
In the whole body the only member without a function is the appendix, and you should not consider that it refers to you by coincidence
Today we must see that serving means that the whole church serves and preaching the gospel means that the whole church preaches the gospel
We should always determine the number of brothers and sisters in the church based upon the number of serving ones
After a person has believed is baptized and becomes a new believer we should bring him to our prearranged meeting for edifying new believers
Those who take care of the new believers must make sure that the new believers are practicing the lessons presented every week
If you do not believe it, just ask them to raise questions after your speaking and see what kind of questions they have
We should not think that the new believers will understand simply because the message was spoken from the podium
You have to make the message up for anyone who has not heard it, and you have to see how it was received by anyone who did hear it
They do not have it simply by hearing the sound or by counting the number of times per second my voice vibrates in the air
Concerning this matter, the brothers responsible for the care of the new believers need to labor in a careful way
Another aspect we need to pay attention to is that all the new believers can immediately take care of the unbelievers
A brother who has been saved for a number of years should coordinate with them and take care of them by leading them step by step
You have to show the new believers that as they have already believed in the Lord, they are priests before Him
With many problems, it is not a matter of just one visitation, but a matter of caring for them for several weeks or months
You need to learn to work, and you also need to learn to be a master builder who leads other brothers and sisters to work
You have to learn before God how to lead many brothers one by one to give make-up lessons to these new believers
These brothers should go one by one to the homes of the new believers and examine how well they are practicing the lessons
They then need to go and check how their prayer has been and whether or not they have written names in their notebook
The work of preaching the gospel, caring for the gospel, and caring for the new believers requires the mobilization of almost everyone
If there are some who have joyous occasions, these brothers should rejoice with them, help them, and pray with them
Since the time of the apostolic church, the church has always been a church of problems, not a church without problems
You should never consider that a situation in which there are many problems implies an inadequate condition of the church
One church, the church in Smyrna, was not rebuked by the Lord, but Smyrna was a church that suffered martyrdom
You should never think that if the church is peaceful and tranquil, going on steadily, then this is the unique proof of the Lord's blessing
The brothers responsible for caring for problems have to make arrangements to handle all the difficulties in the church
When a brother moves away, we need to investigate who in the meetings was especially close to him and whether anyone corresponds with him
We should specifically mention what the situation is among the brothers in the meetings and their spiritual condition
Every one of these brothers who has moved away will be accounted for, and each one of them will be able to stand firm
They do not need to write down everything, nor do they need to record all the messages given in a particular month
Never consider that since you have already written a letter of recommendation, you have washed your hands of the matter
If you do this, after recommending the person, you will not know whether or not the other side has received him
You will not know where he lives and what his situation is, and you will not know the situation of the church there
If these messages can go out continually, we can at least cause the brothers who have moved away to be quite stable
My thought is that in the future, regarding the brothers who move away, letters of recommendation can never be the final thing
It is most convenient to ask these brothers to guide and take care of those who have come into our midst from other places
The brothers and sisters who have been responsible for their care can go on to take care of other new ones who have come
Perhaps they will eventually stop, but within this period of time the brothers must be in fellowship with them
If these matters can be practiced more, there will not be much problem with the brothers who move from other places
The church in the Bible is a church that preaches the gospel, a church that visits people, and a church that cares for others
We should not consider ourselves to be proper simply because we have done much work and have had many experiences in the past
Because we have seen clearly, we are putting all of our strength into this so that we may cause everyone to work in this way also
Whenever God's pillar of cloud rose up, the tabernacle was taken down, and the Levites came to carry the things of the tabernacle
Although what the Levites do is not spiritual, what they do is related to God and to spirituality; it is of the world but not in the world
With regard to the practical affairs of the church, the brothers and sisters must be very concerned and very clear
When a person serves God, there is the priestly work on the one hand, and there is the Levitical work on the other hand
On the one hand, you participate in the spiritual service, and on the other hand, you should also take care of the practical affairs
The responsible ones can tell them that there are two sisters among us who can help them do the laundry two hours every week
At the time of the apostles, the widows of the Hellenists were not adequately being cared for, and there were murmurings
Every week they could go to another brother's or sister's house to help for an hour or two, doing some miscellaneous things for them
It befits them as Christians to go to the homes of poor brothers and sisters and do things with their own hands
If you can use only the two-talented ones and cannot use the one-talented ones in every place, you have failed completely
The church is all the one-talented ones coming forth to partake of the church service on the practical side and on the spiritual side
In the Lord's house there is not one servant without a gift; everyone has at least one talent and cannot have less than one talent
We must know the grace of God so thoroughly that when God calls someone His servant, we would never stand up to say that he is not
Our problem today is that we have inherited the priestly system of Roman Catholicism and the pastoral system of Protestantism
If the Lord can really break through in our midst the way we have taken for the past ten twenty or thirty years will be completely reversed
If God has the assurance to call them to be servants, you too should have the assurance to call them to be servants
We need to use all our thought and all our strength so that all the brothers and sisters may rise up and serve
Today we want to spend some time to see the situation concerning the ministers of the word in the local churches
According to our past custom, the churches in every locality have always maintained the Lord's Day message meeting
The Lord's Day morning preaching meeting, however, is something of Catholicism and Protestantism; it is not a meeting of the church
The nations practice this, so if the brothers in our midst do not, it would be very difficult to maintain the meetings in their localities
Before the meetings in Hankow, we saw that it is wrong for a brother who is a worker to always remain in the same place
Today it seems that a worker still needs to live in a particular place in order to maintain the Lord's Day message meeting
If the church wants to be successful as the church and successful as the Body of Christ in a locality, then the entire Body must serve
The service of the entire Body is that all the people, whether five-talented, two-talented, or one-talented, rise up to serve God
You have to gather the new believers and let them know that every Lord's Day is the day on which all of us are busy
If the church does not endeavor until everyone in the church is working and everyone in the church is serving, then there is no church
Everywhere there will be three or five or seven or eight people serving God; you will be able to find the church everywhere
We could eliminate this manner of listening to messages and, instead, have the entire church serve according to God's word in the Bible
The Lord's Day mornings would be for all the priests to serve man, and the Lord's Day evenings would be for all the priests to serve God
If within you are capable and strong enough, you will always push and always work, and you will be able to tear down our entire tradition
Regarding the ministry of the word, for now we will use the following arrangement: We will have fifty-two topics for the regular year
We need to spend an entire year to touch all the main matters in the Word of God and the way to be a Christian
If you are dead before God, these things will become like publicly recited prayers; they will become dead things
If all of you are dead before God, even the living things will become dead, even a book as living as the Gospel of John
Once some have been saved and brought in, you must pay attention before God to give the new believers a clear leading in the word
Some may ask how we should supply the older brothers, and many other brothers and sisters among us, with the word
Every Lord's Day morning we have to preach the gospel and every Thursday we must have the meeting for edifying new believers
The Saturday night meetings have to be very living, not like today's Lord's Day message meeting, which is maintained in a dead way
What will bind them together is everyone testifying, everyone preaching the gospel, and everyone saving people
If we get them accustomed to working, and they move to another locality, they will feel that they cannot do without the opportunity to work
Those who are burdened for the word and those who have a burden before God and are not passive will stand up on Saturday nights to speak
The Saturday night meetings are the same as the other meetings in that the responsible brothers should pray together
It should be the same with the gospel meetings the meetings for edifying new believers the prayer meetings and the breadbreaking meetings
The responsible brothers should always be there half an hour or fifteen minutes early to have some prayer and preparation
Those that enter in should be the ones who have a genuine burden before God, those who are fearful of having a poor meeting
The elders are for serving the church, and even though they are not for the ministry of the word, they should be apt to teach
Every time you come to the Saturday night meeting, there should be at least a few responsible brothers who are not passive
Perhaps a local church or several local churches in the area may join together two or three times to get some special help
In this way you will see that the church will be very balanced in the matter of the supply of the word, and her way will be straight
Today we are not talking about the locality which is the center of the work, but the localities outside the center of the work
Among them there is also the mutual edifying as in 1 Corinthians 14, that is, help rendered mutually by the saints from the word before God
If there is a need for further spiritual supply, we can immediately release many workers to go out and travel from place to place
If we expect to see a five-talented member rise up, we will realize that there are not very many in the church
Whether or not the gospel can get through is not a matter of preaching by the workers, it is a matter of preaching by the church
Many, including the sisters, need to go out, group by group, in twos or threes, so that every locality may be able to stand on its own
If this habit is overturned, it will be impossible to ask the brothers and sisters to just listen to a message on the Lord's Day
If not, we will definitely have to build a 'Solomon's Temple,' because there will not be a place that is large enough to meet in
After a group of believers has been raised up at the end of a year, you have to deal with them concerning their going on
If a place does not have the church, there will be a church there after one or two hundred people have been sent out
In Acts there are two different ways of preaching the gospel: one way is that of Antioch, sending apostles out to preach the gospel
At the same time, if we want to be strong in the matter of preaching the gospel, we need new apostles to rise up
If the Lord's Day message meeting continues to occupy the central position in a local church, there will be no way for the gospel to advance
We must allow two or three brothers to rise up in every local church to preach the gospel on the Lord's Day and continue this work there
Perhaps, we will preach the gospel every Lord's Day morning and have the ministry of the word in the afternoon
My personal feeling is that we do not need to immediately eliminate the message meeting in the locality where the center of the work is
When we read the book of Acts, we must see that at that time there were not as many ministers of the word as we have now
At that time God's children probably paid more attention to preaching the gospel than to listening to messages
Today it seems that the basic factor of being a Christian is listening to messages rather than preaching the gospel
We must carry it out to such an extent that all the brothers and sisters are preaching the gospel before taking care of other matters
If this way can be carried out, the number of those saved in the past will not be comparable to the number that will be saved
At the same time, there will be no need to maintain so many workers in every place, and we will also begin to see churches rising up
It is your own responsibility before God as to how you will turn your way around and how much time it will take
You must take good care of the saints in order to lead them into this way, not quickly dropping one thing and quickly picking up another
If all the brothers and sisters have not yet risen up, you must continue working until they all rise up to work and preach the gospel
Being the church requires that we preach the gospel as the church; being the church requires that we serve as the church
Concerning the mutual edifying in 1 Corinthians 14, if the local brothers are strong, the Saturday night meetings will be strong
Once the Holy Spirit has the freedom, you can expect the Holy Spirit to speak in the church and operate in the church
At the same time, we need two or three brothers to do their best to send gospel material to the meetings of various localities
At the same time, the attitude of the brothers while listening to the message in a gospel preaching meeting has to be right
It is much easier on the gospel preacher if the attitude of all the brothers in the gospel preaching meeting is right
Otherwise, the person who preaches the gospel must be concerned about the sinners and also about the reaction of the brothers
You need to realize that he is not here taking a test on gospel preaching, but he is doing his best to get people saved
Two-thirds of the time of the gospel preaching meeting is always for casting the net, and one-third is for drawing the net
Sometimes a brother may not feel well or may be absent for other reasons; another brother may then speak in his place
Acts 242 says And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles in the breaking of bread and the prayers
Verse 41 speaks of baptism, and verse 42 says that they continued in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles
Please remember that the apostles gave teaching and fellowship immediately after the church had three thousand people saved
If a certain brother speaks and gives help to people, the responsible brothers should encourage him to speak again
There are times when the words you use in the prayer meeting are not the words you use in your personal time of prayer
Sometimes when you are in a prayer meeting, you do not know whether a certain brother is praying for you or for God to hear
Do not let some brothers or sisters make prayer a kind of preaching of the truth nor let them give an intelligence report to God
Those who are caring for the church in various localities must make a decision concerning the topics of prayer in the prayer meeting
If there are five or six items to pray for and a responsible brother stands up to announce them, he should announce one item first
If the burden is gone, while the brothers are still sitting there or kneeling, a responsible brother should announce another item
After five, ten, or twenty minutes, it may seem that the burden is gone again, and that no one has anything more to pray
The responsible brother should then stand up again and say that there are still a third and a fourth item which need prayer
In this meeting we need to see that the first section is always toward the Lord and the second section toward God
The principle of two or three persons in 1 Corinthians 14 is the principle of speaking the word, not the principle of prayer
The brothers must see that during the time for the Father, the Lord's position is not the same as it was in the first section
During the second section it is always the case that the children of God together with the Lord Jesus come before God to worship Him
If there are sisters in the churches in various localities whom the Lord uses and burdens, we will set up a sisters' meeting
Perhaps in every locality we should make arrangements to teach those who are illiterate to read so that they can read the Bible
Perhaps there are brothers and sisters among us who are especially experienced with and burdened for the children
They should come forth and give us some materials that the children in various localities may receive the benefit
If the children's meeting is carried out properly, it will also provide a good opportunity for more people to believe in the Lord
Today we want to come to the sixth matter, that is, the affairs of the service office-the church business office or work office
Concerning the arrangement of practical affairs, however, the Bible tells us only that there was such an arrangement
It is also sufficiently clear how the church is organized and how the church is local and has brothers, deacons, and elders
Within a region there are apostles being sent out by God to work and later returning to their own center of work
In Shanghai there are a little more than one thousand believers, and we still do not know what the actual need of everyone is
It was another problem to find out the needs of these 'each's, and even more of a problem to distribute to their need
There may be brothers among us who misunderstand to the point that they think that practical affairs need no arrangements
The fact that there are arrangements is spoken of in the Bible, but the method of arrangements is not recorded
God does not recognize that the method of the arrangements is important enough to need to be recorded in the Bible
If a person is one who can receive God's grace, he will receive grace even when he is handling practical affairs
Man does not pay attention to the significance of baptism; he argues first about the outward method and circumstance
Frankly speaking, even if you had only one or two thousand people, you would be unable to deal with the situation
We have no desire that the days of the methods for doing things would be even one day longer than the days of blessing
A problem was discovered-only those sixty years old and above should be enrolled-and the matter was thus settled
In the Bible there are arrangements and there is a record book, but the Bible does not emphasize the details related to this record book
We know that there are arrangements in the church on the one hand, and we need to endeavor before God to find the way on the other hand
If the record book were a method instead of a principle, then God would have told us the length and the thickness of it and its format
In the world there are not that many people who can still remember things accurately after many years have passed
In Shanghai it is called the service office because deacons are the ones taking care of affairs there all the time
We do not want to be like many Protestants who pay attention to these titles; we only want to do things according to the principle
If a church is in a large city or the number of brothers and sisters is more than several hundred, it is not easy to find someone
There must be a place and there must be someone available so that when people come you have a way to make arrangements to take care of them
In other words there must be a place for making arrangements and for contacting one another in order to take care of matters
There may be brothers and sisters who have moved; there may be some who are sick and some who have family problems
Both the place and the personnel must be available; then it will be possible for all the affairs to be handled
There should be no need to ask a certain brother for information, for man's memory is not reliable, and man's life is not reliable either
The service office meets the local needs and is able to take good care of the affairs of the brothers and sisters
Bear in mind that what we should do will be according to the principle of Acts 2 through 6, according to the principle of the record book
There is a need for people to be in the office, especially a group of deacons, to learn to take care of others
Of course, it is good for some brothers and sisters to come and help, but it is best to let the deacons bear the responsibility
He only needs to come to the service office, and the deacons can immediately notify the responsible brothers or other brothers
Whenever something happens, they can prepare copies of the information either by mimeograph or by hand and immediately mail them out
As soon as something occurs, the brothers and sisters throughout the whole city could be informed within one or two hours
Whenever they have time in the service office, they should address the envelopes and prepare them for later use
When the number of brothers and sisters increases and the number of baptized ones also increases, there is the need for records
Everyone who serves in the business office should know these answers and be able to reply immediately and render help
Otherwise, the responsible brothers would need to receive people all day long, and they would not have any way to get anything done
In order to take good care of a church, it is not as complicated before God as we think, like Protestantism is
From morning to evening, if anyone comes to ask about something, there should always be someone there to answer
You need to tell the local brothers and sisters to serve not only in other matters but also in the business office
When people come to the door, either you yourself take care of him or find a brother to come right away to preach to him
You need to speak to them, or perhaps ask them to take a seat while you find another person to come to speak to them
Whatever number of people came to hear the gospel, that many new believers are needed to go and visit them and care for them
Through this you will know the present situation of those who are being cared for by the ones whom you have sent
As soon as you check, you will know by whom a certain person is being cared for or why he has not been cared for
The responsible brothers in all the localities need to look up on their cards the names of these people frequently
Everywhere you go, you should ask, 'What is the situation with the five brothers you have just finished visiting'?
The responsible brothers should not merely preach a message once from the podium and then consider the job over
If it were the same as before with only one message preached per week then everyone would be a preacher resting six days and working one day
Brothers, the question is not whether you have done the work, but whether you have done it and have a way to cause others to do it as well
If you mean business before God, you only need to invest an extra hour, and then the church will be built up one day earlier
On the one hand, we need a very good system and we need arrangements, and on the other hand, we need a record book to write everything down
Although there is a business office and a system set up there, if you do not adequately follow up on people to do the work, it is useless
If you are clear about Gods purpose you will bow your head before God and worship Him saying Lord have a way among us so that You can go on!
We need to show the brothers that the service is the whole church serving, with every member of the Body having its function
You also need to put everything into this work, including your material possessions, your strength, and your life
Before God you must see that being a servant of God is not a favor to Him, but His favor to you; otherwise, how could you serve God?
Formerly, it was those who could not earn a living who came to be preachers, but now such ones as you should also come!
Brothers, when you go out this time, you should not exhort people to come and serve God, nor beg them to serve Him
It is not a matter of whether or not man will offer something; it is a matter of whether or not God will accept it
Your way before God needs to be straight, you need to keep your position, and you need to stand on God's ground to speak
If the locality of a church is large and also has many saints, district meetings become a necessary arrangement
We do not believe as the Congregationalists do that each congregation is a unit, for that is not the teaching of the Bible
The gospel preaching meeting as well as the prayer meeting and the new believers' meeting may be carried out in the different districts
All the other meetings may be held separately-the prayer meeting, the bread-breaking meeting, and the new believers' meeting
The responsible ones need to learn to bear responsibility and to take care of the whole spiritual situation in every district
When Peter was put into prison, as you recall from the story of Rhoda, the house of Mark was a place of prayer
On the other hand, we also acknowledge that the Bible does not give us a regulation concerning the arrangement of these matters
In the Bible, God always maintains a principle rather than giving us detailed regulations concerning how outward things should be done
In the Bible we see only the letter of recommendation, but the Bible never tells us how this letter should be written
Concerning the aspect of practical affairs, concerning the Levitical service , the Bible gives us only clues, not regulations
Another thing we have to consider is what we should do with the local church at the regional center of the work
There are two types of local churches: the general local church and the local church at the regional center of the work
In a place like Philippi, for example, you can see that there were elders, deacons, and brothers and sisters in the church
Philippians 1:1 says very clearly, 'To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons'
It is somewhat different if you are in a local church at the center of the work because there is an extra group, the apostles
The apostles administrate the work in a certain area, and they also administrate the affairs of the local church at the center of the work
According to the history of the church and the word of the Bible, we can see that he was an elder in Jerusalem at that time
At the same time, there are workers who are the elders of the local church on the one hand and the apostles in that region on the other hand
You cannot go beyond the sphere of your local church to go to another local church to administrate their affairs
An apostle can deal with the local elders, but an apostle cannot deal directly with the affairs of a local church
The apostles can administrate the work of the region, but they cannot directly handle the local administration
When you work, you can only use spiritual authority to deliver such a one to Satan, but you have no way to remove him
He had to be in Jerusalem taking care of the work in that area, and at the same time, he was also an elder in Jerusalem
If he had not been an elder in Jerusalem, then he would have had no way to directly administrate the affairs of Jerusalem
According to our understanding, after careful study we cannot find any place in the Bible that tells us that Paul was also an elder
In the church in Antioch, Paul and Barnabas had a part only in the ministry of the word, not in the church affairs
Paul and Barnabas, the two apostles in Antioch, were in the ministry; they did not hold any office in the church
It was not that Antioch thought up a method for going out to work but rather that the Holy Spirit initiated another beginning there
If you know God, you must bow your head and worship Him every time you read Acts 13 and 14 because here is a very important matter
If the Holy Spirit had not initiated a beginning at Antioch, we would have to say that God had only one center on the earth
At Antioch the Holy Spirit designated both of them, set them apart, led the church to lay hands on them, and sent them out
Acts 14:4 says, 'But the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews and some with the apostles'
Verse 5 says A hostile attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews with their rulers to treat the apostles outrageously and to stone them
Verse 6 says, 'They became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region'
It was the Holy Spirit who initiated another beginning at Antioch, established another group of apostles, and sent two out to work
Now we know that before God there was not only one center but two centers, not only one region but two regions
For this reason, whenever they went out, they had to return quickly because the responsibility of Jerusalem was upon them
From now on, when brothers among us go out, you must remember that those who are apostles can go, but those who are elders need to return
Because the apostles are there, they may be willing to give a special supply, special messages, or special ministry of the word
The apostles cannot directly interfere with a local church; they cannot deal with the affairs of a local church
In other words, what the apostles want to do must go through the elders; the things which the apostles want to do cannot be done directly
These two, one in Ephesus and one in Crete, traveled in the surrounding areas and appointed elders in various localities
The highest authority in a local church is the elders; however, the authority of the elders is received from the apostles
They thought that though the elders are appointed by the apostles, they did not have to listen to the apostles
When there were brothers who did not respect the elders and problems occurred, the letter of accusation by two or three was sent to Timothy
Spoken words can easily become rumors; but since a letter of accusation is written down, it can become a formal accusation
The direct administration of a local church is not in the hands of the apostles; it is in the hands of the elders
The pattern given to us by this unique instance is the pattern accepted by the church for the past two thousand years
The sign of a church being spiritual depends upon whether it has ways to solve problems and whether those ways are appropriate
Some went to Antioch and told people that the believers in the church should also be circumcised according to the regulations of Moses
Under these circumstances both Paul and Barnabas had to go to Jerusalem, and other brothers in the church in Antioch also went up with them
Verse 4 says, 'And when they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders'
The conference in Jerusalem was a conference of the apostles and elders; it was not a conference of the church
A few believers, who formerly were Pharisees, rose up and said that they wanted the Gentiles to be circumcised and to keep the law
You should give those who oppose and who have different opinions the opportunity to speak by telling them, 'Speak as much as you wish'
God desires that the responsible brothers, the brothers with authority, would be those who can listen to others
The responsible brothers, the brothers with authority, should have the ability to sit and listen to all the opposing words
If a brother cannot listen to the speaking of others to the arguments of the opposers then he is not qualified to be a leader in the church
The apostles and elders allowed the brothers who had opinions and the brothers who wanted to speak to present their views
Although this meeting belonged to the apostles and elders they allowed the brothers to speak and allowed anyone who wanted to come to attend
Why are you now testing God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear'?
Verse 13 is the best part: 'And when they finished speaking, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me'
The history of the church shows us that at that time he was acting somewhat like a chairman, although this may not be the right term for it
For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who proclaim him in the synagogues, he being read every Sabbath
After hearing so much, with the opinions of all the responsible brothers being the same, they made the decision
In the church there is neither the majority listening to the minority nor the minority listening to the majority
In the church there are only the brothers and sisters expressing opinions and the spiritual men making the decisions
As Peter stood to speak, he was like a newborn baby, free from any outside feeling and not at all affected by the spirit of debate
Once you get involved with the debate, you are not qualified to be a leader, nor are you qualified to be one in authority
He further continued by saying, 'And He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith
Why are you now testing God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
We need to pay special attention to the fact that when these two brothers stood up to testify, they had to be very serious before God
Peter, who started first, stood up to speak, and his spirit was not at all affected by the debate of the brothers
When God's authority is absent and God's presence is absent, any kind of conference in the church will not be carried out well
You need to learn to capture the spirit; then you can go forward with all the things falling into place spontaneously
It seems like some have been assigned to lay a foundation, and others have been assigned by God to build upon it
They go to find a place, they make arrangements related to the place, and they determine the position of the building site
There is no need for those who build upon the foundation to seek out a place or to determine where the best site for the building is
Paul did not want to build upon their foundation, because he was a person established by God to be one who laid the foundation
He was bold to make such a statement, and he was indeed a wise master builder who laid a foundation upon which others needed to build
You need to keep in mind that Paul was an apostle and that Barnabas was also an apostle when he went out with Paul
In the record of Acts 3, the Spirit of God placed Peter's name first when describing Peter and John going up together to the temple
Please remember that it was Peter who preached in chapter two, even though the eleven apostles were also standing there
Peter took the lead all the way, even though the other apostles fellowshipped with God, communed before God, and labored together in oneness
When the church in Jerusalem heard this and sent out workers to them, it was again Peter and John who went together
Acts 10, concerning the events at the house of Cornelius, is a portion of the Word with which we are more familiar
Later, we see that Peter took some brothers with him from Joppa, but the names of these brothers were not mentioned in the Bible
After a period of time, Barnabas heard about Saul, and he went to Tarsus to seek for Saul and brought him to Antioch
Please remember that in God's work and in the church of God there can never be a situation in which there is no order
It does not mean that there is a system of organization or committees, in which everyone has the right to speak and vote
It is not God's intention that we listen to the authority that He has established because this person is perfect
If husbands had to be perfect, all of the wives in the whole world would not need to obey their husbands, because no husband is perfect
Later, when they were on the way in verse 7, Sergius Paulus 'called Barnabas and Saul to him and sought to hear the word of God'
Later, they came to Pamphylia and then to another place called Antioch, a place with a similar name, except that it was Pisidian Antioch
The Holy Spirit, however, allowed Paul to step forward to speak a strong word; the Spirit used him to be a minister of the word
Acts 1343 says And when the synagogue gathering had been dismissed many of the Jews and the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas
Verse 12 says, 'And they called Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, since he was the one who took the lead in the discourse'
When they addressed him with a name of their god, they used a name with a higher status because he was the one speaking and taking the lead
Following this, we can see that the crowds originally were sacrificing to both apostles, but the apostles refused to accept such a thing
We hope that brothers and sisters can eventually learn that when two are together there will always be one who obeys
When brothers live together or when brothers fellowship together, spontaneously there is one who is in the forefront among them
The first thing in God's work and in the coordination among workers is to ask God to open our eyes that we may know the authority among us
We need to humble ourselves to see that as soon as a word is spoken, a matter is decided, or an opinion is expressed, we need to obey
A basic need among co-workers is that they be ones to whom we can open up our heart and with whom we can have fellowship
Suppose a brother has a very thick, heavy, solid outer shell; whether he lives alone or with ten people, he remains an individual
Many people, whether they are alone or with ten people, pray, seek God, speak to God, and seek the will of God as individuals
There is absolutely no way for them to bear anyone else's burden because they only think about themselves day and night
We are used to accommodating ourselves, bearing our own responsibilities, and not paying attention to others' affairs
It means that we are still responsible toward God, that we still draw near to the Lord, and that we still seek after Him
When they get to Wenchow, if everyone is an open person and everyone seeks the Lord together with one accord, the power will come
They may call themselves co-workers and live together, but each one is still wrapped tightly in himself and doing his own thing
Toward our brothers, our spirit needs to be open, our thinking needs to be open, and many times even our mouth needs to be open
Many say that they are broken before God; however, if we turn them around and put them before other people, they are not broken in the least
When they go to another place, they will pray with others and will discuss and consider things together with others before God
For ten or twenty years perhaps they have not had any co-workers or learned to bear responsibility with other people before God
Has there been one time when some brother shared a certain matter with you, and you brought this matter to God in prayer?
If we stay in our former condition, we will still be tightly wrapped up in ourselves, and our outer shell will not broken
If only you go to God alone, you do not know the coordination of the Body, and it will be impossible for anyone to entrust any burden to you
The supply from the coordination depends on the supply from the authority and also the supply from the fellowship
Never think that you should take care of everything by yourself and not care about the matters of other brothers and sisters
The Bible clearly shows us that in the coordination of the work, the leading workers are those who send people out
He was very clear before the Lord that he should send Timothy; he was sending Timothy according to his hope in the Lord Jesus
In the church in Corinth some said, 'I am of Cephas'; some said, 'I am of Paul'; and some said, 'I am of Apollos'
We need to learn before God that the authority established by God can control the movements of the young brothers
We do not have time to study them in detail; we will read only the portions concerning the outward way of the work
What we see here is neither discussion nor hope, because we know that Paul was martyred not long after he wrote 2 Timothy
Remember that in Acts Barnabas wanted to take Mark with them, but Paul disagreed because Mark went away when the work was at a crucial time
In the beginning they went together; but when the work was intense, Mark left, Mark got sick, and Mark was not able to work
The amazing thing is that later Barnabas did not have the opportunity to work with Paul, but Mark had such an opportunity
Please remember that the young brothers need to learn what has been entrusted to the older brothers and learn to obey them
After Paul went to Corinth, and after Silas and Timothy came to Corinth from Macedonia, Acts 18:5 says that Paul was constrained by the word
Many consider that an apostle is a person who has no other income or revenue and puts all his time into the work
If this concept is true, then Paul definitely would not be an apostle, because Paul did not drop his job altogether
Many people have not seen thoroughly before God what a worker is and what an apostle is; therefore, they have made this mistake
When the Lord called Matthew as he was working in the tax office, the Lord told him to leave his job and follow Him
For this reason, there is no requirement for the elders to drop their jobs, although the apostles provide an example of dropping their jobs
The Bible shows us that after a person has left his occupation, he is no longer called by the same designation
Luke was a physician, and because the Bible still used that designation, he must have continued his occupation
Matthew was a tax collector, but after he gave up his job as a tax collector, he was no longer called Matthew the tax collector
You can see that if he had completely stopped practicing medicine, the Bible would have called him only Luke, not Luke the physician
Due to making tents, his hands may have been cut in many places, wounded in many parts, and much skin may have been lost
Please remember that in this matter Paul and Peter were the same; Paul also was a person who left his job completely
The man who needs to leave the occupation of tax collecting is the one for whom tax collecting is an occupation
If it was not left behind, one could not be an apostle, because the service of the apostle would be rather difficult for him
There is a great difference between the situation today and the situation in those days in the matter of transportation
We can see how heavy the burden on Paul was at that time, not only for himself, but also for the brothers who were together with him
Alford tells us that in those days, in order to make a tent, you needed to use a certain dye to color the tent material
Because he knew how, Paul made tents with his own hands when Timothy, Titus, Silas, and Luke were with him, to supply their needs
Whether one made tents or practiced medicine, all were for the purpose of being an apostle, not that he might not be an apostle
It would be better at that time to work a little with your own hands so that you could support yourself and also support others
It is not changing from apostleship to the occupation of tentmaking, but supporting our apostleship by the work of tentmaking
If a brother thinks that he cannot do the work well or that he has financial difficulties, he may go to teach or to fish
Peter's fishing meant that he considered the Lord to have died, to be finished, to be terminated, and that everything was hopeless
If he received money, he would be an apostle, and if he did not receive any money, he would still be an apostle
When there was the support from the brothers, he would be an apostle, and when there was no support, he would still be an apostle
Please remember, the principle of tentmaking not only does not distract us, but it makes us single-hearted all the more
We have to bear the work which the Lord has assigned to us and the responsibility which the Lord has given to us
Our purpose before God is not to become rich, but to earn money, to have a little income, and to support the Lord's work
A person may work on a locomotive or on a shipwater and fire are not the same and land and sea are not the samebut he is still a coworker
Many do not pay attention to how strong or how critical the purpose is, but rather to whether or not things are the same
As a rule, the church should be responsible for the entire support of the work and all the needs of the apostles
Co-workers are those who have one heart, one purpose, and one ambition before God and who are serving God to please Him
As long as their purpose is the same, these are all co-workers in the Lord, no matter what jobs their hands are engaged in
There are the normal expenses of the church, such as the wine, the bread, electricity, water, and in some places, rent
In the church God especially stresses that His children should take care of the needy, especially the needy brothers
In every church the brothers and sisters who pass on money must be people with keen feelings; we cannot send insensitive persons
Sooner or later those people may fall into a condition of great poverty before God; definitely God will place some discipline on them
We need to select a brother who is especially gentle, whose feeling is especially keen, one who can sense the situation from just one word
They said, 'Every time that you call us to bear the sedan-chair, we always respond very quickly because we really favor you'
When Paul was working in the region of Macedonia and in Thessalonica, the church in Philippi once and again sent money for his use
When we read the book of Philippians, we know that when Paul was in Macedonia and Thessalonica, all of his money came from Philippi
We need to help the brothers everywhere to see and help them to learn to give money to the brothers who are workers
The money from all the local churches should be sent not only to the individual workers, but also to the work in the entire region
At that time there was not just one church that sent money to Jerusalem; the churches in Galatia sent money as well
Paul exhorted the church in Corinth to gather their money and send it quickly to Jerusalem, just as the churches in Galatia had done
If you keep the income for yourself, a time will come when you will be manifested to be unworthy to lead your co-workers
The elderly brothers in every locality should also learn to give to their co-workers from the offerings they receive
We cannot support a brother who is useful in the work according to his spiritual gift; we have to support him according to his need
We know that the burdens of some brothers are light, those of some brothers are heavy, and those of others are very heavy
The responsible brothers should learn to be aware of how many brothers are in the work in this region and how great their needs are
At the same time, according to the principle, the money which a local church receives should be sent to other localities
In England, whenever a pastor goes to a place to be a pastor or an overseer, he will say, 'I am called to' a certain place
Amazingly, many are called to wealthy places, but no one is called to impoverished places, and everything of the world follows them
There was no mention at all of the need in Antioch or of the need of the work in Antioch; Paul only carried money to Jerusalem
At that time there could have been the misunderstanding that Paul's tentmaking business was prosperous and that he did not need more money
Perhaps one brother will handle decision making in particular, and one brother will mainly take care of the bookkeeping
In such a case we should distribute according to the proportions, and no difficulties with the conscience will arise
Question: In the past there were a few localities which wrote to all the other localities when they needed to build meeting halls
If an individual brother fellowships with certain brothers in other places, that is all right, because that is not something formal
Whenever an apostle goes to a certain place, can we ask him to make an effort to mention that the elders should receive double honor?
When workers go to the local churches, they need to tell the brothers in the local churches to provide material support for the elders
Practically, however, the use of the money in the church is not in the hands of the elders, but in the hands of the deacons
In other words, the use of Jerusalem's money was not in the hands of the twelve apostles, but in the hands of the seven deacons
When arrangements are made for the money, the deacons, not the elders, know the local needs and the needs of the poor
The responsible brothers do not know what the situation is with the brothers in need, but the seven brothers know
It is good if a church can care for the responsible brothers, but the church needs to be aware of their responsibility
The brothers who are deacons may say, 'I know that at this time a certain brother is having a considerable difficulty
It is best to entrust the deacons with this matter so that they can take care of it every week and every month
In the Bible the day of settling accounts is not once a month, unlike the tree of life which yields its fruits every month
In other words, the disbursement of funds is the business of the seven deacons; it is not the business of the twelve apostles
Concerning the elders themselves, the Timothys should indeed always say, 'You should care for the needs of the responsible brothers here
Question In the past when various localities began to have meetings the leading brothers there seemed to be able to bear the responsibility
Answer: In a certain place there may be a group of saints beginning to meet, with some learning to bear the responsibility
Many people, as soon as they stop bearing responsibility, behave like outsiders and do not care for anything anymore
When younger brothers encounter those who are more advanced in the Lord than themselves, they should be able to ask them to step forward
When several brothers go out together or talk together in a room, spontaneously someone will take the lead, and some others will follow
Strictly speaking, the responsible ones in all the places should be considered by the workers who are reliable in the Lord
There may be many brothers who live together with eight or ten other brothers, yet they can still act individualistically
When some workers of God or believers are together, they spontaneously are confronted with the matter of authority
Consequently, when several brothers have the presence of the Holy Spirit, you must believe that God has a mouthpiece among them
It does not mean that when several brothers are together, you need to elect a team leader or a person in charge
You must realize that even when several go out for a walk on the mountain or when you all gather together, someone will be in front of you
Wherever God's children are, regardless of the environment or occasion, there are those in authority and those who should submit
When a person does not submit to authority, he will still act individualistically no matter how many others may be with him
It is not a matter of receiving one authority, nor a matter of receiving ten authorities; it is a matter of receiving authority
The servant who came later obeyed all of my words, but he did not obey the words of the servant who came earlier
Many people's problems have nothing to do with the matter of faith or believing in God, but the matter of fellowship
Perhaps he will then realize that he cannot make it simply as one member, nor can he make it merely by his union with Christ
Many have not yet been brought on this way; they are still walking on the way of individualism, laboring by themselves
One day you will reach a point that even when all these conditions are fulfilled, you still cannot get through
Only a person who has passed through this pathway before God can escape individualism, not doing things individualistically
When God gives them a little light one day, they will see that their problem was actually in the matter of fellowship
Today some brothers may go out with several others, but these brothers can still be completely individualistic
If a man is under authority and lives in fellowship, even if he has one exception, he still does not damage the basic principle
Otherwise, if you have one person, it is called one-person individualism; if you have ten persons, it is called ten-person individualism
Question: According to the Epistles to Timothy, the elders must be appointed by people like Paul, Timothy, or Titus
They shared the same principle, which is that the Holy Spirit has placed the elders as overseers of the whole flock
As each goes down from the mountain, no brother can become loose or casual in appointing elders in other places
Perhaps, among those apostles, they might have all felt that at least these two should bear the local responsibility at the same time
Jerusalem knew the situation in Samaria, and they also saw that the believers in Samaria had not received the Holy Spirit
Suppose while there are a number of sisters eating together, they feel that one among them should go to a certain sister's home
We clearly see that in this certain brother's home, the home of Jason, they were praying, seeking, and considering their future
As a result they said that Paul and Silas should not continue living there and that for them to remain there would be very difficult
You need fellowship because perhaps you have not seen, no one has made a decision, and you yourself do not know what to do
Even if Paul made the decision, it was not through authority but through the fellowship with the house of Jason
In Thessalonica it was very clear: The brothers were together, Paul and Silas were in danger, and the Jews wanted to arrest them
Even though Paul was a brother in the lead, you still have to admit that there was also an element of fellowship
They clearly were not from Jerusalem or Antioch, but they were another group of people who initiated another beginning
We cannot say that in Acts there were only two centers; we can only say that the Holy Spirit only mentioned two centers
What this means is that only what is useful to teaching is recorded, and what is not useful to teaching is not recorded
