<h2 class="head1">THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John, who testified the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, even all that he saw.&rdquo; Verse 9 says, &ldquo;I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.&rdquo; Revelation 19:10b speaks again of the testimony of Jesus saying, &ldquo;I am your fellow slave and a fellow slave of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy.&rdquo; We should never consider that Revelation deals only with prophecies. When it deals with prophecy, it reveals the testimony of Jesus as the spirit of the prophecy. The testimony of Jesus is mainly of two things&mdash;on the positive side, that God is brought into man and man is brought into God, and on the negative side, that all the things that Satan brought in have been terminated on the cross by Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Throughout human history, many biographies have recorded the history of human lives. With every record of a human life there are many things of Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, and the kingdom of darkness. There is only one record of a human life like that of Jesus, especially as recorded in the Gospel of John. In this biography there is the record of the human life of a person who was full of God and in whom was nothing of Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, or the authority of darkness. In the universe and throughout the history of the human race there has never been a life like this one. Everyone else&rsquo;s life is a life with Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, and darkness and with almost nothing of God. By His incarnation Christ brought God into man, and by His death and resurrection He uplifted the human nature and brought it into God, producing a mutual mingling of God with man. Now all the negative things have been dealt with, put away, and terminated, and God is mingled with man. Now God abides in man and man abides in God. This is the testimony of Jesus.</p>
<p>The book of Acts is the continuation of the record in the Gospels. The four Gospels are a record of the life of Jesus, and Acts is the continuation of this life story. In the continuation of the story of this wonderful man, there is the testimony of Jesus. The testimony of Jesus is the church life. The church life is not merely a group of elders, deacons, and believers put together. The church life is the testimony of Jesus, a testimony that God is mingled with man and man is living in God, and that all the negative things&mdash;Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, and the kingdom of darkness&mdash;have been dealt with and put away.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST</h2>
<p>As we have seen, the church is a golden lampstand holding Christ as its very reality, life, and everything, and within Christ as the lamp is God as light. The beginning of this book reveals the local churches as the lampstands holding Christ with God, and at the end of this book there is a universal expression composed of all the redeemed ones as a lampstand holding Christ as the center, as the reality, as the life, and as everything, with God as the light. This is the subject of the book of Revelation. Therefore, this book is the revelation of Jesus Christ (1:1). The revelation of Jesus Christ is not only an objective revelation given by Christ, unveiling certain matters in the future; it is a subjective revelation of Christ, revealing Christ Himself to us. The word<em>revelation</em>refers to the opening of a veil to disclose something hidden behind it. In this universe there was something mysterious, secret, and hidden from human eyes and human understanding. This was Christ. However, after Christ&rsquo;s ascension the veil was opened, and Christ is now revealed to us. That Christ is revealed to us is the meaning of<em>the revelation of Jesus Christ.</em></p>
<p>Revelation is a long book of twenty-two chapters, but in brief, it may be divided into three sections. The first three chapters comprise one section, revealing Christ in the church. The second section, from chapter four through chapter twenty, the main part of this book but not the most important part, reveals to us Christ in God&rsquo;s judgment and kingdom. These seventeen chapters show us that in God&rsquo;s judgment and kingdom Christ is the very center. Thus, even this section is the revelation of Christ. It is not a revelation merely of prophecy, such as the prophecy of the beast with horns. Throughout all these chapters there is the line of the wonderful, glorious Christ who is the very essence, reality, and center of God&rsquo;s judgment and kingdom. The third section, Revelation 21 and 22, reveals Christ in eternity as the very center, centrality, and universality of all things. In eternity Christ will be the centrality and universality of God and of man. Christ is everything. The first section reveals Christ in the church, the second section reveals Christ in God&rsquo;s judgment and in His kingdom, and the last section reveals Christ in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A BOOK OF JUDGMENT BASED UPON LIFE</h2>
<p>Revelation has much to say about the church. We have seen, for example, that Christ is the lamp and the church is the lampstand. The church is the expression of Christ, but this expression must be one hundred percent purified. It must be entirely of pure gold without any mixture or alloy. Gold is purified by fire. Therefore, Revelation is a book of purging and purifying fire. The first vision in this book is a revelation of Christ as the one whose eyes are like a flame of fire and whose feet are like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace (1:14-15). When He looks at people, He burns them in order to purge away everything which does not correspond to the nature of God. This purging and burning is His judgment, and His judgment begins with the church.</p>
<p>In the first of the three sections of this book, there is the judgment of the divine burning in the church, and in the second section there is the judgment of the divine burning in the world. The last section reveals the issue, the result, of the judgment by burning. Anything which does not match the nature of God is purged away by this burning fire and is cast into the lake of fire. After all of the judgments by burning, everything in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem is purified.</p>
<p>The apostle John, who wrote the Gospel of life, also wrote Revelation, a book of judgment. Anything which is not of the divine life will be judged. Whatever is eternal is of life, but whatever is not of life is judged, purged, and burned away. In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus is revealed as the One who is life (1:4; 11:25; 14:6). In Revelation, however, although the Lord is still the One of life, He is also the Judge. He comes in to judge according to His divine life. Anything that is of life will pass the test, but anything that is not of life will be judged, rejected, and burned. This is not a small matter. Therefore, Revelation is a book of judgment based upon life. Christ has come to impart Himself into us as life, and we must live by this life. If we do not, we will have many things which do not correspond to the nature of this life; all these things will be burned.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PARALLEL WITH THE BOOK OF EZEKIEL</h2>
<p>The book of Ezekiel in the Old Testament corresponds to the book of Revelation. The beginning of Ezekiel also presents us with the burning testimony of God (1:4, 13, 27), just as the first three chapters of Revelation portray the testimony of Jesus. After the testimony of burning fire at the start of Ezekiel, there is a long record of burning judgment on the people of Israel and on all the nations. Eventually at the end of that book, there is the building of God, Jerusalem, with twelve gates. Jerusalem as a city with twelve gates (Rev. 21:12) is not a new thought in Revelation. It was mentioned already in Ezekiel 48:31-35.</p>
<p>In addition, at the end of Revelation there is a city with a flow of living water, and in Ezekiel there is the same thing (Rev. 22:1; Ezek. 47:1-12). A flow of living water continually issues out from the temple, the dwelling place of God. Hence, in composition and in spiritual meaning, these two books correspond to one another. The matters we have presented here will help us to see the entire book of Revelation.</p>
