<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING OF THE HOUSE OF JEHOVAH<br />
IN RELATION TO ISRAEL&rsquo;S WELFARE<br />
AND MESSIAH&rsquo;S COMING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hag. 1&mdash;2</h1>
<p>In this message we will cover the book of Haggai, a book that is concerned with the building of the house of Jehovah in relation to Israel&rsquo;s welfare and Messiah&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<p>Haggai 1:1 is the introductory word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Haggai</h2>
<p>The name Haggai in Hebrew means &ldquo;My feast&rdquo; or &ldquo;the feast of Jehovah,&rdquo; signifying that Haggai the prophet, who had been born in captivity in Babylon, expected earnestly to return from the captivity that the feasts of Jehovah might be restored.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Haggai&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Haggai&rsquo;s ministry was 520 B.C., at the time of Zechariah (Ezra 5:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of his ministry was Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of his ministry was the returned Israelites.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of the prophecy of Haggai is Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the returned captives for the building of His house.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of the book of Haggai is that the building of the house of Jehovah is related to the welfare of God&rsquo;s people today and to the coming of the millennial kingdom with its Messiah in the age of restoration. In the Old Testament the house of God, or the temple, was a type first of Christ as the house of God individually, and then of the church, the Body, the enlarged Christ, as God&rsquo;s house corporately. Thus, we should consider that Haggai refers to us, since we are the reality of the type. Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the returned captives signifies His dealing with us in the recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Revelation concerning Christ</h2>
<p>The revelation concerning Christ in the book of Haggai covers two matters.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Christ&rsquo;s Being the Desire of All the Nations</h2>
<p>First, this book reveals Christ in His being the Desire of all the nations (2:7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Christ&rsquo;s Coming as the Messiah<br />
in the Coming Age</h2>
<p>Second, this book reveals Christ in His coming as the Messiah (typified by Zerubbabel the governor) in the coming age (2:23).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Sections</h2>
<p>Haggai has three sections: the introductory word (1:1); Jehovah&rsquo;s rebuke and charge concerning the delay of the building of His house (1:2-15); and the prophecy concerning the house of Jehovah in the millennium and the promise of Messiah in the coming kingdom (2:1-23).</p>
