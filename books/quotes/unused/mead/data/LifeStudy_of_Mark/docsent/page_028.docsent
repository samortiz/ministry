   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Satisfaction</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth incident, recorded in 2:23-28, is that of the Lord s caring for His followers hunger rather than for religion s regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mark 2:23 and 24 say, And it came about that He passed through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way, picking the ears of grain.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And the Pharisees said to Him, Look!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why are they doing on the Sabbath what is not lawful?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we see that the Slave-Savior cared for the hunger of His followers rather than for the regulation of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As those who follow the Savior we are not hungering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, we are filled and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because we are satisfied, we can testify, We don t care to keep the regulations of religion and remain hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Religious regulations always leave us hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But as those who follow the Slave-Savior, we are not hungry any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every day of the week, including the Sabbath, He gives us something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We don t care if others condemn us according to their religious regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Others may care for religious regulations, but we care to be satisfied in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This case, therefore, may be summarized by the word satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Freedom</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word that best summarizes the fifth incident, that of the Slave-Savior s caring for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion 3:1-6 , is the word freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this incident we see that on the Sabbath the Savior restored a man s withered hand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we see that He did not care for the ritual of religion; He cared for the relief of the suffering one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He wanted to release that one, to liberate him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, in this incident we have the matter of freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE ACTUAL HISTORICAL SEQUENCE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us review the five words used to describe these five incidents: forgiveness, enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What a marvelous sequence we have here!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Imagine how different it would be if forgiveness came last instead of first.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the historical sequence recorded in Mark, first we have forgiveness and then enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The forgiveness of our sins by the Lord always issues in enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can testify of this from our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These incidents were not arranged by Mark in order to present a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the contrary, these incidents are presented according to historical fact and sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, they happened in the order in which Mark put them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These five events took place under the Lord s sovereignty according to the actual sequence of the enjoyment of His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first item in this sequence is the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can testify from our experience of the Lord s salvation that when we have the forgiveness of sins we also have enjoyment and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This joy is followed by satisfaction and freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we consider the sequence of these five incidents in the Gospel of Mark, we realize once again that the Bible truly is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Apart from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, no human being could compose such a writing as we have in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not believe that Mark was highly educated or had a thorough knowledge of Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be sure, the Greek in the Gospel of Mark is not as high as that in the Gospel of Luke or in the Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But even though the language in the Gospel of Mark may not be especially polished, the five incidents in this section are arranged in a marvelous sequence, a sequence that corresponds fully with our experience of the Lord s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to this sequence, we have forgiveness, enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we consider Mark s record, we need to worship the Lord that this indeed is part of His holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not merely a composition written by a person with limited education.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No, it is the breath of the sovereign God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the Scripture, including the Gospel of Mark, is God-breathed 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that the narration in Mark 2:1 3:6 is God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a reminder of the sequence here, I recommend that you write in the words forgiveness, enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom next to these sections in your Bible.</S>
