   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear respected Sister X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the beginning of the war, both the south and north parts of the country have been greatly affected.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have been remembering the brothers and sisters living in the war zone day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A while ago I received the Shanghai local newsletter as well as The Open Door from Hankow and realized that the Father has bestowed wonderful grace to preserve us all in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is more than I had expected.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have a little sum of money which we are forwarding to Shanghai.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our only assurance will be when the Prince of Peace appears soon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The work in the few meetings around Ch'iao Tun Men is being taken care of by the two Wang brothers; I am merely their helper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Presently, there is a lack of responsible ones; the number of meetings and attendants has gradually increased.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a pity that the shepherding work has been absent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Dear brothers and sisters, we are often driven by the circumstances around us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although we are far away from each other, we hope that our prayers for one another will be all the more earnest so that we may not commit any errors.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I wish you victory and peace in the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now there are over forty brothers and sisters breaking the bread.</S>
