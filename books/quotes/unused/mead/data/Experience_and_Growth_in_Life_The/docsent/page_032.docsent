   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 10 says, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Paul wrote the Epistle to the Philippians, he had the experiential knowledge of Christ and was experiencing the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While in the Roman prison, he may have been bound in stocks under the threat of execution by being beheaded or thrown to wild beasts in the amphitheater.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In that situation he needed to know the power of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The power of Christ's resurrection is His resurrection life which raised Him from among the dead Eph 1:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the resurrected and resurrecting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This power was in Paul as the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reality of the power of Christ's resurrection is the Spirit Rom 8:11 , and the bountiful supply of the Spirit is the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The nature of Christ's resurrection is the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without the Spirit of Jesus Christ, there is no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today the Spirit is in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The way to experientially know the power of resurrection is to turn to our spirit and remain in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It may not be necessary to pray to remain in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may simply praise, sing hallelujahs, and shout triumphantly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the way to experience the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to experience the power of resurrection, we are brought into suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul experienced the power of resurrection in a Roman prison.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not experience suffering, we cannot know this power.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this sense, the power of resurrection needs a "prison."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Marriage life is an example of this kind of imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a good sense, our marriage does not usher us into a banquet but into a "prison."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The cross of Christ may be compared to a cooking mold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When dough is pushed into shaped molds and cooked, the result is a bread or pastry in the shape of the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are the "dough" that has been put into the "mold" of the cross by the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our marriage life is a part of that mold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In one sense, marriage life is not an enjoying life; it is a suffering life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul said that those who marry will have affliction in the flesh 1 Cor 7:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, marriage has been sovereignly ordained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Unless one has received a special gift from the Lord Matt 19:10-12 , he should not remain unmarried.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our children are also a part of the mold of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have seen many parents suffer because of their children.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To experientially know the power of Christ's resurrection needs us to be put into the mold of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Philippians 3:10 Paul speaks of the fellowship of Christ's sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus calls us to follow Him in His sufferings, bearing the cross Matt 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To bear the cross is to enjoy the fellowship of the sufferings of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BEING CONFORMED TO HIS DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Philippians 3:10 first speaks of knowing Christ as a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can never exhaust telling who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second, it speaks of knowing the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then while we are experientially enjoying the fellowship of His sufferings, we are being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The death of Christ is a mold.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are living in this mold of death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ's death should be the mold of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We will all eventually declare: "I am not only living; I am dying.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I die to everything; I am a dying person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My living is in the mold of Christ's death."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not conformed to the death of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The death of Adam is a terrible thing, but Christ's death is sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While we are living, we die in the mold of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are enjoying knowing Christ experientially; we are enjoying knowing the power of Christ's resurrection; and we are enjoying knowing the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While we are in the enjoyment of this experiential knowledge, we are being conformed to the mold of His death.</S>
