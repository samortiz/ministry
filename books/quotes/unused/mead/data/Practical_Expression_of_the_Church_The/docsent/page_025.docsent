   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPER RECEIVING OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is only by being so liberal and general that we can receive all the saints in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are otherwise, we cannot avoid being sectarian in the matter of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are special in anything and insist upon that, we will probably not receive those who differ from us in certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the Apostle said, "Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What he meant when he referred to "him that is weak in the faith" is illustrated in the following verses: i.e., the matter of eating and the keeping of days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By this we are affirmatively told that we must receive the saints who differ from us in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Any saint who holds a different opinion or concept regarding the things of which we are in favor, we must receive, "for God hath received him."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as he is a saint, as long as he has been received by God, we must receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since God has received him, we have no right to reject him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our receiving must be the same as God's receiving, no less and no more.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's receiving is the basis of our receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our receiving must not be according to our taste, our opinion, or our assertion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It must be in accordance with God's receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It must be based upon God's receiving nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God receives people according to His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as a person receives His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, as his personal Savior, regardless of the concepts he holds regarding all other things, God receives him immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since God receives people in this way, we too must receive people in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our receiving must be in accordance with God's receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If our receiving differs from His, it means that we are wrong: either we are more narrow or more broad than God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This will cause much trouble and damage to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's receiving is based upon Christ's receiving, and Christ's receiving is in accordance with our faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whoever believes in Him, He will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whoever receives Him, He will never reject.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said, "Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out" John 6:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since coming to Him, believing in Him, receiving Him, is the only condition for Christ's receiving, so we must receive people upon the same basis with nothing added.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as anyone believes in Christ our Lord, as long as he receives Him as his personal Savior, we must receive him with nothing else required.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regardless of how he may dissent in so many other things, as long as he is a real believer in the Lord, we have no choice but to receive him, for the Lord has received him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why the Apostle said, "Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must receive whoever Christ has received.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must have such a proper receiving of all the saints that we may keep the proper unity; otherwise, we can never keep ourselves from being sectarian and causing much confusion and damage to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To practice the church life by keeping the proper unity, such a general receiving is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May the Lord have mercy upon us!</S>
