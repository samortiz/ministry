   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Therefore, we do not say that good works are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, we do say that good works are useless as far as salvation is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man cannot be saved by his good works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Neither can he be prevented from salvation by his evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Good works are applicable to the matter of the reward, the matter of the crown, the matter of the glory, and the matter of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Good works are useless regarding the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God cannot allow man to be saved by his work; neither will He allow man to be rewarded by his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God cannot allow man to perish because of his evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God can determine only man's salvation or perdition by whether or not he believes in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Similarly, God cannot determine a man's receiving of His glory by whether or not one believes in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether or not you have His Son in you determines the matter of eternal life or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether or not you have good works before God determines the matter of receiving the reward and the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, God will never save a person because he has merits, and He will never reward one who has no merit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If someone has merits, God will not therefore save such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the other hand, God will never reward anyone who has no merit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man has to come before God totally helpless and meritless in order for God to save him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But after salvation, we have to be faithful, and we have to endeavor to produce good works through His Son Jesus Christ in order to obtain the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please do not think that good works are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are saying that good works are useless towards salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Good works have nothing to do with salvation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Salvation depends on whether or not you would repent of your former position.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It depends on whether you would have regret over your past to believe in His work on the cross and in His resurrection as the proof of your justification.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the crux of all problems.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The matter of work is related to reward.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Work is useful, but only in the matter of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today's problem is that people will not differentiate between salvation and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Bible, there is a clear distinction between salvation and the kingdom and between the gift and the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because people would not differentiate these matters, the question of salvation is mishandled, and the question of reward is also mishandled.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has never placed the matter of reward before the unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God only wants the unsaved ones to obtain salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, after salvation, God places the reward before them so that they will endeavor, pursue, and run after the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Salvation is not the last step of the Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, salvation is its first step.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After we have been saved, we have to run and pursue after the reward before us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The problem is that we think that our salvation is our reward.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The sinners think that to be saved is to obtain the reward, and therefore they rely on their works.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Christians think that the glory is simply grace, and therefore they become foolish in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Please apply work only to reward and grace to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through salvation God separates the saved ones from the unsaved ones; He separates the ones having eternal life from those being condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Similarly, God also separates His children into two groups by His reward.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Just as salvation separates the worldly people, in the same way, reward also separates God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God separates His children into the obedient and disobedient ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With the worldly people, it is a matter of having faith and not having faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With the Christians, it is a matter of being faithful or not being faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With the worldly people, it is a question of being saved or not being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With the Christians, it is a matter of having or not having the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today's problem with God's children is that they magnify salvation too much; all that they see is simply salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They think that only when their work is taken care of can they be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result, they have no more time to pursue after the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If one has not passed through the first gate, he cannot pass through the second.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May God be merciful to us that we would realize that the matter of salvation is solved already.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It cannot be shaken, for it has been accomplished by the Lord Jesus already.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is fully done.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today what we have to strive for is the reward before us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There will be a big differentiation in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some will have glory, and some will not have glory.</S>
