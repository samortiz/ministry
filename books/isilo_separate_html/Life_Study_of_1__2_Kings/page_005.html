THE RECORD OF THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS<br>OF 1 KINGS BEING CONSIDERED A CONCLUSION OF<br>THE HISTORY OF DAVID RECORDED IN 1 AND 2 SAMUEL</H2><P>The record of the first two chapters of 1 Kings could be considered a conclusion of the history of David recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel. This is strong evidence that the historical books in the Old Testament were written in the way of unveiling God's economy, not merely in the way of the history of Israel. This is critical to us who are the students of the holy Scriptures. The entire Bible, although written by more than forty authors in sixty-six books, unveils to us only the unique economy of God, which He made for the accomplishment of His heart's desire, that is, to have Himself expressed and enlarged through Christ in His Divine Trinity. Such an accomplishment of God is more involved with the church in the New Testament than with Israel, God's elect, in the Old Testament and will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. 1 AND 2 KINGS BEING ONE BOOK<br>IN THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES</H2><P>First and 2 Kings were one book in the Hebrew Scriptures, called The Books of the Kings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE WRITERS</H2><P>There is no evidence in these two books to indicate who the writers were. Some of the Jewish and Christian teachers suppose that Jeremiah might have been the writer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE TIME</H2><P>The history covered in these two books encompasses 426 years. The first book covers 118 years, from 1015 to 897 B.C., that is, from the decease of David (2:10) to the reign to Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, king of Israel (22:51). The second book covers 308 years, from 896 to 588 B.C., that is, from the reign of Jehoram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel (3:1-3) to the captivity (25:1-7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII.
