The King can take this pathway, but we in our natural life cannot. Therefore, the Lord must die for us and enter into resurrection for us. Through His death our negative situation is settled, and by His resurrection He is able to be taken in by us and even become us.</p><p>What was Matthew’s main intention in 26:31-75—to unveil the victory of Christ or to expose the defeat of Peter? I believe that his intention was to present both—each in vivid contrast to the other.…In the light of the contrast between Christ’s victory and Peter’s failure, let us now consider verses 31 through 75. [Notice that the Lord warned the disciples in verse 31 that they all would be stumbled because of Him.] The Lord was the Shepherd, and the disciples were the sheep who were to be scattered. However, all the disciples said that they would not deny Him. All of them, especially Peter, had the assurance and the confidence that they would follow the Lord to the end, no matter what the pathway might be.</p><p>In His warning the Lord promised that He would be raised up and go to meet with them in resurrection in Galilee (v. 32). He also predicted that, on the night of His betrayal, Peter would deny Him three times (v. 34).</p><p>After warning the disciples, the Lord went with them to Gethsemane (v. 36). Gethsemane means oil press. At Gethsemane the Lord was pressed so that the oil, the Holy Spirit, could flow out. After taking Peter, James, and John aside, the Lord went to pray alone. When He returned from praying the first time, He found the disciples sleeping (v. 40). The Lord Jesus had told them seriously that His soul was “exceedingly sorrowful, even to death,” and He had asked them to watch with Him (v. 38).…When the Lord came back after praying the third time, the disciples were still sleeping. In verses 36 through 46 we see a contrast between the life that is absolutely able [to be] for the kingdom and the life that is completely unable.…The life we have by our natural birth is completely unable to be for the kingdom.</p><p>In the garden of Gethsemane, the Lord was pressed to be sorrowful and deeply distressed, even unto death. After praying to the Father three times, He took the Father’s will and was prepared to be crucified for the fulfillment of the Father’s will.
