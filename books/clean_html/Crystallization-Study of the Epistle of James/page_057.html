<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Words in the Epistle of James<br>according to His Old Testament Concept</H2><P>The words in the Epistle of James spoken by him that exalt the Mosaic law and charge the New Testament believers to keep it, that confuse God's dispensation of the ages, and that are devoid of Christ, His death, His resurrection, and the Spirit are surely not the words of God, but words spoken by James according to his Old Testament concept concerning the Mosaic law which is in contrast to the grace in God's New Testament economy, and according to his vague vision of the difference between God's Old Testament dispensation and His New Testament dispensation. Yet these words were written by James in his Epistle under the inspiration of God for the divine purpose to expose him in his wrong concept concerning the law and in his vague vision concerning God's dispensation of the ages in order to teach and enlighten all the believers in Christ that they may know that they should not be frustrated by James's defective words from going on further to seek the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the old-creation-terminating death of Christ, and the all-new-creation-germinating resurrection of Christ for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. TWO GOVERNING PRINCIPLES<br>OF THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SCRIPTURE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The First Principle</H2><P>The first principle is that all the Scripture should be interpreted with the Scripture. Every portion, even a single word, of the Scripture should be interpreted with and according to the entire Scripture. If any interpretation of the Epistle of James, as a book in the Scripture, is not interpreted according to the entire Scripture, it becomes a book other than the Scripture.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Second Principle</H2><P>The second principle is that the eternal economy of God is the central line of the entire Scripture. The interpretation of the Scripture should be strictly governed by this central line under its adequate enlightenment. If any interpretation of the Epistle of James is not in harmony with God's economy, it is off. No saint of God who is a genuine seeker of the scriptural truth and who is enlightened with the central line of the Holy Scripture would ever accept such an off-track interpretation that he might not be sidetracked as many have been.</P>
