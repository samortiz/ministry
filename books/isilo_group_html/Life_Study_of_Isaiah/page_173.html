In those verses He is revealed as a child of both the divine and human natures born of a human virgin and as a son in the divine nature given by the Eternal Father. In this message we want to see the revelation of Christ in Isaiah 8:14-15. In these verses Christ is revealed as a sanctuary to the positive ones. He is also seen as a stone to strike against, a rock of stumbling, a trap, and a snare to the negative ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. A SANCTUARY TO THE POSITIVE ONES</H2><P>Christ is a sanctuary to the positive ones (Isa. 8:14a). In order to enter into this revelation, we need to see that the Triune God is our dwelling place. In Psalm 90:1, Moses said, "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations." Our God is our eternal dwelling place. Because He is our dwelling place, we can rest within Him. There is also food and drink within Him. Light, air, a wall for the dweller's protection, and entrances also accompany a proper dwelling place. Our God is such an enterable dwelling place to us with all of these aspects.</P><P>The Old Testament shows that God gained a collective people, the people of Israel. He brought them to Mount Sinai and charged them to build a tabernacle. Eventually, when they entered into the good land, they built the temple to replace the tabernacle. The tabernacle and the temple were not only the dwelling place of God but also the dwelling place of His serving ones, the priests. They lived and served in the temple of God. They were living together with God. God was their "roommate." We have to realize that God is not only our Savior, Redeemer, Master, Lord, and life but also our dwelling place. He is also one of the dwellers, so He is our roommate. The very God in whom we believe is our roommate, with whom we are living every day.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_172.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_174.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 173</div><br></body></html>
