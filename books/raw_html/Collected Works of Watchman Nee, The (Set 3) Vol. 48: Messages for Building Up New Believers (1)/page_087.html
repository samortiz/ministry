<h2 class="head2">Example 3: Hymns, #377</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>If the path I travel<br />Lead me to the cross,<br />If the way Thou choosest<br />Lead to pain and loss,<br />Let the compensation<br />Daily, hourly, be<br />Shadowless communion,<br />Blessed Lord, with Thee.</li><li>If there's less of earth joy,<br />Give, Lord, more of heaven.<br />Let the spirit praise Thee,<br />Though the heart be riven;<br />If sweet earthly ties, Lord,<br />Break at Thy decree,<br />Let the tie that binds us,<br />Closer, sweeter, be.</li><li>Lonely though the pathway,<br />Cheer it with Thy smile;<br />Be Thou my companion<br />Through earth's little while;<br />Selfless may I live, Lord,<br />By Thy grace to be<br />Just a cleansèd channel<br />For Thy life through me.</li></ol><p>This also is a very good hymn. The expressions and wording are very poetic, and the feeling is very deep. Everything about it belongs to a higher realm and is lofty and mature. It is rare for a hymn on fellowship to reach such a standard. There is not a tint of unnaturalness or extreme. It is a genuine expression of a genuine lover of the Lord toward Him. It is perfect submission borne out of perfect consecration. It is the voice of submission that comes from the heart of one who has no resistance toward the Lord.</p><p>"If the path I travel/Lead me to the cross,/If the way Thou choosest/Lead to pain and loss,/Let the compensation /Daily, hourly, be/Shadowless communion,/Blessed Lord, with Thee." This is full of consecration and submission.</p><p>Stanza two is the best stanza in the whole hymn. Here the feeling ascends still higher. "If there's less of earth joy"&mdash;the writer is contemplating&mdash;"Give, Lord, more of heaven." He is praying to God, not for deliverance or for change, but for more fellowship. "Let the spirit praise Thee, /Though the heart be riven." Here is a person who can differentiate between the heart and the spirit. The heart may be broken, but the spirit can praise. The heart may be riven, but the spirit is still fresh before God. He knows the difference between the heart and the spirit. He does not ask for enjoyment of the heart but for compensation of the spirit. He has begun the ascent, but the next line is still higher. The first line says, "If there's less of earth joy," while the fifth line says, "If sweet earthly ties, Lord,/Break..." These two lines are linked by the word earth. This is poetry. "If sweet earthly ties, Lord,/Break at Thy decree,/Let the tie that binds us,/Closer, sweeter, be." He seeks neither compromise nor escape. He asks only for better fellowship. He jumps from the "sweet earthly ties" in the fifth line to "the tie that binds us." This is lovely. The feeling is fine, the words are right, and the structure is wonderful. This is beautiful!</p><p>Since stanza two reaches the climax, stanza three turns into a prayer: "Lonely though the pathway,/Cheer it with Thy smile." "Cheer it with Thy smile"&mdash;this is so spiritual and poetic. "Selfless may I live, Lord,/By Thy grace to be/Just a cleansèd channel/For Thy life through me." This means that he asks for nothing else except that he would be a selfless and holy vessel to carry out God's will. This is the prayerful finale of a consecrated person in suffering. If we read this hymn carefully, we will see that this is truly a fine hymn. We have to come to God to learn these hymns and the spirit of these hymns.</p>
