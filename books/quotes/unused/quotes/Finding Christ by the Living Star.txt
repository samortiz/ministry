Many of us when we were young attended Christian Sunday Schools and in that setting took the Bible as a book of stories
There are other Christians, however, especially the great teachers and speakers, who make the Bible a book of teachings
You see, just in the title of God, the Lord Jesus pointed out the life not the story, not the teaching, but the life
In that chapter regarding the genealogy and conceiving of Christ we do have a story and a certain amount of teaching
In all Christianity, all the preachers, ministers, and pastors tell people that they must find Christ and know Christ by the Bible
Merely to hold the Bible in your hand and read Micah 5:2, saying that Christ will be born in Bethlehem, does not work
The star is the living revelation, the living vision, not the old and dead knowledge of the Scriptures, not the dead knowledge of Micah 5:2
To know Christ today is something living, not according to dead Bible knowledge, but the living, heavenly star
Whenever we say that we are right and others are wrong, be sure the Lord will leave us and go to the wrong ones
Now consider what the wise men did: they saw the heavenly star and they followed it, but they made a great mistake
They received the vision, but they soon turned to their human concept and exercised their natural understanding
Herod called the chief priests and scribes of the people together and asked of them where Christ should be born
You cannot get living guidance in Jerusalem; you cannot receive the heavenly vision in religion; you have to leave
BUT the living, instant guidance, the guidance of this very moment to lead us to the very spot where Jesus is, is indispensable
After you have seen the living Christ, you will always take another way; you will never go the same way as you came
God told His people in His holy writings that Christ would be born in Bethlehem; so all His people received this knowledge
During Mary's pregnancy He was brought to Bethlehem just for a short time, not in an ordinary way, but in a very extraordinary way
Just a short time later, He was brought away from Bethlehem to Egypt, and then from Egypt to settle and grow in Nazareth
You see, Jesus really fulfilled the Scripture by being born in Bethlehem, but we may say that it was in a 'sneaky' way
There not only was the prophecy in the Old Testament but also the sovereignty of God and the sovereignty of God in a sense is rather sneaky
If we have His presence, we will really know when He is in Bethlehem, when He goes away, when He comes back, and where He is raised up
What the Lord has been doing through history, towards the worldly and religious people, is always hidden and 'sneaky'
Once we knew Christ after the flesh and considered Him the little man of Nazareth, but now we know Him no longer in this way
Forget about the outward things, forget about the flesh; try to see the church not after the flesh, but after the spirit
Outwardly speaking, the church is clothed with badger skin there is no beauty, just the toughness and even the wildness
All the main things of the Bible, as a rule, begin in the Old Testament and go right through the New Testament to the end of the Bible
In this book we have Christ as the morning star and those faithful followers of Christ in the churches as the stars
At the beginning of the New Testament the star was outside of religion, but at the end of the New Testament the star is within the church
If you would see the star today, there is no need for you to look to the sky, there is no need for you to do as those wise men
In the Acts and the Epistles the leading ones were called elders or bishops, but in the last book of the Bible they are the stars
It is by the shining in today's darkness that people receive the guidance and are turned from the wrong way to the right way
In every local church there is a star; in every local church there is something shining, leading people to the right way
Today we are not in the age of Matthew 1 and 2, but in the age of the Book of Revelation, in the local churches
We must take heed to the words of the Bible till something as phosphorous rises within us that is, Christ as the daystar
We must take heed to the sure Word until it rises within us as Christ, as the phosphorous, as the day breaking through the darkness
To have the Bible in your hands is one thing; to take heed to the Word until the daystar rises in your heart is another
What we need today is to take the Word into us, to take heed to the living Word until something within rises and shines in our heart
Sometimes when we open our heart and take heed to this sure Word, something within is shining, rising, dawning, breaking through
The situation may be extremely dull, the surrounding full of darkness, but something within is enlightening, shining, filling with glory
If we will just go along continually with this inner, rising star, we will constantly be in the Spirit and be a good follower of Christ
If we have the living Word as the daystar rising within us and we are one with the seven Spirits, eventually we will become the stars
We not only have the star shining within us, but by looking to the star and following in the Spirit we become the stars
The Lord said unto Abraham, 'I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore'
Read Revelation chapters 2 and 3 again and you will realize that eventually all in the local churches should be the stars
Many times when you go to a believer or great teacher, you sense that they are so lacking in clarity and transparency
That person may have all the knowledge of the Bible, but the more he talks with you, the more you feel imprisoned
Sometimes however perhaps not frequently you come to a little brother and when he speaks with you he simply says Hallelujah praise the Lord!
Another brother, however, may answer that he simply does not know the answer, but while he is speaking, you sense that he is crystal clear
No word can express it, but while you are with him, you begin to be clear, and you know what to do about your marriage
Though we know little of the teachings though we cannot give people so many instructions yet when they come to us they will be enlightened
They themselves are wandering: they have no ground, they have no standing, they have no certain way to go on with the Lord
If we follow the wandering stars, eventually our portion will be the same as theirs the blackness of darkness forever
Anyone who keeps us from the genuine local church and from meeting on the ground of unity with the Lord's people is a wandering star
The true stars are those who turn many to righteousness, those who do not lead people astray, but turn them to the right way
The Lord be merciful to us that we may always be kept in the right way to meet the Lord, to worship Him, and to offer our love to Him
