   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Galatians 2:20 says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This shows us how a Christian should live.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He should live by not doing anything by himself, but by allowing Christ to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, let Aaron speak and Moses be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some people are not eloquent, yet they need to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What do they do?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They ask you to speak for them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But while you are speaking, they are not satisfied; they interrupt with a word or two.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This makes it very difficult for you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If Moses' mouth could not speak, he should take Aaron's mouth as his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank the Lord that this is God's way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God did not change Moses' mouth; rather, He gave him a new mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God does not change a person's mouth; He gives him another mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God does not change a foolish man into a wise man; rather, He causes Christ to become wisdom to the foolish man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, this is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has not changed foolish men into wise; rather, He has made Christ our wisdom; Christ has become wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose a matter needs great wisdom to handle and settle it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may try this way and that way in vain; your little mind may be exhausted, yet you still cannot come up with a solution.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then you say, "Lord, I am foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If it is left up to me to do, I will surely not be able to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I can only look to You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You do it for me."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After you have trusted in the Lord this way, the Lord may direct you to do something, say something, or take some action, and you may not even be aware of the great wisdom involved in doing these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But after you have done them, one day you will say, "What I did that day was not something that I could have done by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What I said that day was not something that I could have said by myself."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that you have not changed at all; it was the Lord who became your wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is Christ becoming wisdom to you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Originally, we had to handle things by ourselves, yet we could not handle them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So we allowed Christ to be our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to remember that Christ's wisdom does not become our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In addition, Christ is not giving us wisdom so that we can become wise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, Christ in us is becoming wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Wisdom belongs to the Lord and not to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is our wisdom; He is becoming our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, if we know what it means for Christ to "become," we can live a proper life before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have previously said that Christ becoming our wisdom means three things: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What do these things mean?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us first consider righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will speak on the other two.</S>
