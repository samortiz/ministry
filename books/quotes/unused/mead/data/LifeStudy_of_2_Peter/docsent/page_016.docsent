   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND PETER MESSAGE SIX THE DIVINE PROVISION 6 Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 1:5-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider 1:5-11.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This section of 2 Peter is concerned with development by the growth in life unto the rich entrance into the eternal kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>DEVELOPING THE SEED OF FAITH Virtue</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 5 says, And for this very reason also, adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith virtue, and in virtue knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word rendered adding literally means bringing in besides.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Besides, along with, the precious and exceedingly great promises given to us by God, we should bring in all diligence to cooperate with the enabling of the dynamic divine nature for the carrying out of God s promises.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 5 Peter urges us to supply bountifully in our faith virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What the divine power has given us in 1:3 and 4 is developed in verses 5 through 7.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To supply virtue in faith is to develop virtue in the exercise of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The same principle applies to all the other items.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word supply here actually means develop.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Peter is telling us to develop what we already have.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have faith, and now in our faith we need to develop virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The faith Peter mentions in 1:5 is the like precious faith allotted to us by God 1:1 as the common portion of the New Testament blessing of life for the initiation of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This faith needs to be exercised that the virtue of the divine life may be developed in the following steps to reach its maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Faith in 2 Peter 1 may be compared to a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On other occasions I have pointed out that in chapter one of 1 Peter the seed is the word with Christ in it as life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now in 2 Peter 1 this seed becomes our faith, which, no doubt, is the like precious faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This precious faith is one with Christ as the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After a seed has been sown in the soil, it needs to be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The principle is the same with the development of the seed of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our faith we need to develop virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Literally, the Greek word for virtue means excellency.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It denotes the energy of the divine life issuing in vigorous action.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If faith is regarded as the seed, virtue may be considered a root that comes out of this seed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1:5 Peter also tells us to supply in virtue knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Virtue, the vigorous action, needs the bountiful supply of the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2, 3, 8 regarding the all things related to the divine life and godliness and the partaking of the divine nature vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>3-4 for our enjoyment in the following development.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The knowledge which we should develop in our virtue includes the knowledge of God and of our Savior, the knowledge of God s economy, the knowledge of what faith is, and the knowledge of the divine power, glory, virtue, nature, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, this is the knowledge of all things related to life and godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must have this knowledge developed in our virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not adequate to have virtue without knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe that knowledge also is a primary root that develops out of the seed of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With virtue and knowledge we have the growth of the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Self-control</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 6 Peter continues, And in knowledge self-control, and in self-control endurance, and in endurance godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Self-control, or temperance, is the exercise of control and restraint over the self in its passions, desires, and habits.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This needs to be supplied and developed in knowledge for the proper growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once we have acquired knowledge, it is easy for us to become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this reason, we need to develop in our knowledge self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Self-control implies restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a tree grows, the roots spread out, but the trunk grows upward in a rather restricted manner.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is an illustration of the fact that along with the development of virtue and knowledge, we need the restriction that comes with self-control.</S>
