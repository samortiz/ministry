<h2 class="head1">THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The River of Water of Life</h2>
<p>The final chapter of the Scriptures, Revelation 22, begins, &ldquo;And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street&rdquo; (v. 1). The two&mdash;God and the Lamb&mdash;are on one throne, indicating that God is in the Lamb. This is similar to 21:23, which tells us that God as the light is in the Lamb as the lamp. For eternity God is in Christ. Outside of Christ, we cannot meet God. If we want to find God, we must find Him in Christ. God dwells in Christ, who is His very embodiment. God as the light is in Christ as the lamp, and the one throne is the throne of God and of the Lamb.</p>
<p>Out of this throne comes a river of water of life. Whereas the throne is a matter of authority, the flowing river is a matter of fellowship. The fellowship of life is simply the flow of the Holy Spirit. The throne at the peak of the city and in the center of it represents the divine authority, and from this throne flows a river as the fellowship of the entire city. It is by this flowing that the entire city enjoys the divine fellowship and communication, and in this fellowship there is the divine authority. Authority always goes together with fellowship.</p>
<p>By reading the Old Testament together with the New Testament, we can see that God&rsquo;s building always needs the kingship and the priesthood. In order to build up God&rsquo;s habitation, we need the kingship for authority and the priesthood for fellowship. In Zechariah 6:12-13 the Lord Jesus is the One who builds up God&rsquo;s temple with two statuses, as the King for authority and as the Priest for fellowship. In order to build up a local church in a proper way we need the headship, kingship, authority, and throne of God, and we also need His priesthood as the real fellowship. This is signified by the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Tree of Life</h2>
<h2 class="head3">One Throne, One River, One Street,<br />
and One Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Verse 2 says, &ldquo;And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; The New English Bible translates the latter phrase of verse 2 as &ldquo;the leaves of the trees.&rdquo; This is a thoroughly wrong translation. In the New Jerusalem everything is unique. There is one throne, one river, one street, and one tree of life. The editors of The New English Bible may have wondered how one tree could be on this side and on that side of the river. In the middle of the spiraling street there is the river of water of life, and the tree of life in the middle of it grows and spreads to the two banks of the river.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Walking under the Lord&rsquo;s Headship<br />
by the Inner Flow</h2>
<p>A street is a place where we walk and move. Our daily walk and move must be according to the divine flow. If we do not have the flow, we do not have the Lord&rsquo;s leading; that is, we are not on the Lord&rsquo;s way. Whatever we do and wherever we go must be according to the flow within us. If we choose a certain shirt at the department store, the flow within us may stop. If so, we should not buy that shirt. We may have no way, no &ldquo;street,&rdquo; to buy that shirt. On the contrary, if there is a flow, there is a way. We may say that we have the Lord&rsquo;s leading to do something, but do we have the flow? If the flow stops, what we are doing is not the Lord&rsquo;s way. If what we do is on the Lord&rsquo;s way, there must be a flow within us. Sometimes even when ministering in certain places, I have had no way to speak. Because there was no flow, I had to stop.</p>
<p>The inner flowing comes out of the throne of God. In order for us to have the flow, God in Christ must be enthroned within us, and we must be under His authority. If we rebel against God and are not under His authority, we will not have the flow. If we enthrone Christ, honor and respect Him on the throne, and submit to His authority in everything, right away we will have the flow within. The inner flow is the way we follow, and the inner flow comes from submitting to the throne. Many times we are rebellious within. All sins come from rebellion; rebellion is the root of all sins, and rebellion comes from the self. Even in small matters we may not submit to the Lord. We put the Lord aside and place ourselves on the throne. Because of this, the flow within us stops. However, if we repent, enthrone Christ, submit to Him, and take His authority and headship, the flow within us will be recovered.</p>
