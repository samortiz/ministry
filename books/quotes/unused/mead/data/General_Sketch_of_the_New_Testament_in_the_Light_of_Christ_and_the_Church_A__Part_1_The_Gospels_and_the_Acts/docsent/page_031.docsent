   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE CRUCIAL TRANSITION FROM THE GOSPELS TO THE ACTS Scripture Reading: John 20:22; 1 Pet 1:3; Acts 1:5; 2:1-4; 11:15-16; 2:36; Psa 2:6; 1 Cor 12:13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the end of the four Gospels and the beginning of Acts, there is a crucial transition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also must pass through the same kind of transition, not merely in the knowledge of these matters but even more in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have seen, the four Gospels show us a picture of the Lord Jesus living, walking, working, and acting on the earth by the divine life and in the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Acts, there are thousands of persons as His Body, the church, who live, walk, work, and act in the same life and by the same Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The persons have changed, but the life and the Spirit are still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The change is not one of life; it is one of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the crucial transition from the Gospels to the Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE IMPARTATION OF LIFE THROUGH THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This change in persons was accomplished by the Lord's resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Resurrection is a matter of life, whereas ascension is a matter of authority and power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because many Christians today are not clear about the Lord's resurrection and His ascension, we need to speak something further concerning these two points.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we saw in previous chapters, by His death and resurrection, the Lord imparted Himself into us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Christ was resurrected from the dead, we were raised up together with Him, that is, resurrected with Him Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, 1 Peter 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before His resurrection, Christ and we were separate, but by His resurrection Christ came into us to be our life and our very nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John 12:24 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus as the one grain of wheat became many grains through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For a grain of wheat to fall into the earth signifies death, and for it to grow up out of the earth signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, the grain of wheat grows up not merely by itself but with many other grains.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many grains are raised up and brought into life by the growth of the one grain, which signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We were raised up with Christ by His resurrection and in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may ask how we could have been raised with Christ before we were even born.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not argue with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It also tells us that we died with Christ on the cross long before our birth Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With God there is no consideration of time; He considers everything from eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have seen, 1 Peter 1:3 says that we have been regenerated by the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second Peter 1:4 goes on to say, "Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By His resurrection, Christ imparted Himself into us not only as our life but with His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way we partake of the divine nature.</S>
