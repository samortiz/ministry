One Young Bull<br>for a Satisfying Fragrance to Jehovah</H2><P>For the sin of ignorance, the assembly of Israel was to "offer one young bull for a burnt offering, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah" (v. 24a). This burnt offering signifies Christ in His freshness to satisfy God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. With Its Meal Offering and Its Drink Offering</H2><P>The burnt offering for the sin of ignorance was to be offered with its meal offering and its drink offering (v. 24b). As we have pointed out, the meal offering signifies Christ in His humanity to be the food of God and man, and the drink offering signifies Christ pouring out Himself to satisfy God. Such an offering is needed for the ignorant sin of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. One Male Goat for a Sin Offering</H2><P>The offering for the sin of ignorance also required one male goat for a sin offering (v. 24c). The sin offering signifies the Christ who was made sin for us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. To Make Propitiation for All the Assembly<br>of Israel, So That They Would Be Forgiven</H2><P>"The priest shall make propitiation for all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and they shall be forgiven" (v. 25a). In the foregoing message, we saw that Moses prayed that the children of Israel would be forgiven. God's forgiveness is based on Christ's redemption for propitiation, without which God has no ground to forgive man. Thus, if the people were to be forgiven, something had to be offered to God for their propitiation. If we, taking Christ's redemptive death as our standing, ask God to forgive us, He must do it based on His righteousness, not on His mercy (1 John 1:9). This is according to God's governmental administration. Our learning of things such as this can keep us from committing further sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. For a Person Sinning through Ignorance</H2><P>In Numbers 15:27 through 29 we have a word concerning a person sinning through ignorance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. A Female Goat a Year Old for a Sin Offering</H2><P>"If one person sins through ignorance, he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering" (v. 27). This goat signifies Christ, who knew no sin, being made sin for us by God (2 Cor. 5:21). This matter, which is according to God's righteousness and His governmental administration, is deep and mysterious.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_083.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_085.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Numbers &nbsp; pg 84</div><br></body></html>
