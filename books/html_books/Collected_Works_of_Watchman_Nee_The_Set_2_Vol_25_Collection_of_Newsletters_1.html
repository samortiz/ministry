Its origin is explained in his open letter to all the brothers and sisters in the first issue of the magazine. Twelve issues were published over a period of two and a half years, with the last issue being published in July 1935. We have placed Issue Nos. 1 through 9 in Volume 25 and Issue Nos. 10 through 12 in Volume 26 of The Collected Works.</P><h1 class="series">COLLECTION OF NEWSLETTERS</h1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ISSUE NO. 1</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>November 1933</H2><P CLASS=INDENT1>(This letter by Watchman Nee to the brothers and sisters meeting in various places explains the reason for publishing Collection of Newsletters. Hence, this portion of Issue No. 1 is entitled, "The Origin.")</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORIGIN</H2><P>To the brothers who call on the Lord out of a pure heart:</P><P>The Lord is gracious to us, and for this we thank Him. In this end time He has given us light and enabled us to know that it is His pleasure to manifest through us in this world the characteristics which befit His church in order that He might obtain something for Himself. We also thank Him for bending our hearts and producing in us the willingness to obey Him and please Him. Except for this, we are incapable of generating even one good thought.</P><P>In the past few years we have been enabled to see that in order to please Him and manifest the characteristics of the church, we must not meet divisively; but rather, we must meet in His name. (This is a very small matter, but we still thank the Lord for it.) Hence, there are many brothers meeting in the name of the Lord in different localities. (We know of over a hundred of these places.) This is surely a joyful and comforting matter. However, although the assemblies in the Bible all had their own local administration, they still maintained fellowship with each other. There are many assemblies now; yet some of them do not even know that other local assemblies exist. This being the case, they surely could not be aware of what is happening in other places. This cannot be considered as fellowship.</P><P>We believe God's will is that we should be local in administration and yet at the same time be open to correction from others. Local administration enables us to bear our own responsibility, while fellowship enables us to receive help and corrections from others. This is why in 1 Thessalonians there are such words as "imitators" and "pattern" (1:6-7; 2:14). Unless we are open to correction from others, we may be wrong without realizing it, and others may advance while we do not know how to follow.</P><P>Many brothers have written letters to individuals among us giving news of their respective localities. Also brothers have written asking us for information about certain localities. We feel that such intercommunicating of news is both fitting and urgent, but we have lacked adequate time to write such letters.</P><P>When we published the first issue of Notes on Scriptural Messages, we intended to include news from various localities. Later, however, we realized that the majority of the readers of Notes on Scriptural Messages were not walking with us, and for this reason we felt that publishing the news in that paper would inevitably give rise to misunderstanding. For this reason we discontinued that practice. However, the need for intercommunication of news has by no means disappeared. Rather, it has been increasing daily.</P><P>After receiving a little light from God to see the Body of Christ, we feel deeply that for an individual to act alone is regrettable and that for an assembly to move independently is terrible. If we are accurate in our perception, the greatest shortage among today's believers is that they do not know what the Body life is. It seems that they have been detached from the others who are faithfully following the Lord. The individualism of believers today is almost universally prevalent, and the work of the cross, the life of resurrection, and the power of the Holy Spirit are being used almost exclusively for the development of individual holiness, for individual spirituality, and to help achieve individual victory. To be an individual is truly important, but to be only an individual and not to know how to be a brother among the brothers or a sister among the sisters is simply another form of the most hateful "self." How we wish that from now on the children of God would learn to forget about the self and to be the servants and slaves of the brothers.</P><P>To this end we desire to issue a little publication entitled Collection of Newsletters. It is not our intention to make this publication available to all believers, but rather it is for those who meet with us and walk with us in every locality. We will not send it to those who do not stand on the position of the church as required by the Lord.</P><P>The contents of this publication will be exclusively news and prayer requests from the various localities. The source of the news will be mainly from correspondence we have received. One source will be mail which we have received directly from the brothers, and another source will be letters which were written to a third party and then forwarded to us.</P><P>Concerning the nature of this publication, we need to give a word of explanation. We know that the common practice is to publish news so that men might (1) obtain the glory and (2) use the news as a basis for advertisement to make material gain. Because of this, there will no doubt be some spiritual brothers among us who, desiring to avoid this kind of thing, would rather not have their news published. We must remember, however, that the fellowship of the brothers is important. Your move and the activities of the assembly in your place are the concern of all the brothers. You should not deprive your brothers of the encouragement which they might receive from you and the privilege of making supplications for your work simply because you prefer your activities to remain hidden. No doubt, on your part you are humble, but what about the brothers who will not receive your help? The Body life is a life of caring for the brothers. It is, no doubt, wrong to seek prominence in the religious world, but to purposely hide yourself among the brothers (not the outsiders) is not being humble but shrinking back. To do such a thing does not mean that you are free from self-consideration; on the contrary, it means that you are always looking at yourself. This is not spiritual living, but an activity purposely performed by the flesh. May God deliver us, on the one hand, from the evils of today's religious world and, on the other hand, from excessive self-consciousness of the soul and from "deliberate humility." Please keep in mind the examples in the Bible. On the one hand, the Bible says the following: "Your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world" (Rom. 1:8); "For from you the word of the Lord has sounded out; not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but in every place, your faith toward God has gone out" (1 Thes. 1:8); and "We have heard of your faith..." (Col. 1:4). But, on the other hand, it also says, "And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared the things that God had done with them and that He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles" (Acts 14:27), and "They declared the things that God had done with them" (Acts 15:4).</P><P>What is needed today are not spiritual giants who cultivate themselves seclusively and who are self-conceited, but we need brothers who care for others and know how to be members together with others. We do not need hiding brothers; we need helpful brothers.</P><P>It is altogether a matter of your intention. May we, on the one hand, not purposely try to shrink back, and, on the other hand, not intentionally try to show off. Let us not seek glory from men, but in all things let us seek to glorify God and to build up the brothers.</P><P>Please pay your attention to the following points:</P><P>(1) Please do your best to send us news regarding the situation of the work, difficulties encountered, results accomplished, requests for prayers, and other information.</P><P>(2) In principle, all reports should be accurate, clear, and edifying. There is no limitation as to length and style.</P><P>(3) If some individuals should send you letters mentioning news of the assembly in a certain locality, please forward the letters to us in order that the brothers in different localities might know more about the Lord's work.</P><P>(4) We would also like to publish announcements regarding the assemblies and the work.</P><P>(5) The responsible brothers in each locality are cautioned against passing on this publication to those who do not meet with us. It is better not to give this publication to any but those who are walking with us.</P><P>(6) All mail should be addressed to the Editor, Collection of Newsletters, P.O. Box 323, Shanghai.</P><P>We now put this matter in the hand of God and before the brothers. May this be acceptable to you as it is to God. May the grace of God be with your spirit. Peace be with you.</P><P>Your brother,<br>a bondslave of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING<br>IN CHEFOO, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>Dear Brother Watchman in the Lord:</P><P>The second day after you left Chefoo, the young Brother Lee came to my home in the evening and wanted to bring you to Brother Lee of the Shin-feng Company to console the latter. Because you had left the day before, he began to talk with me. Later, we felt that my home was too hot, and we decided to go to the seaside and talk while we cooled ourselves off. On the way to the seaside, he suddenly brought up the subject of baptism, the Lord's table, and denominations. When I heard this, I was overjoyed. I had never discussed these matters with him and had intended to go to him after you had left to discuss these matters with him in detail. After we sat down by the sea, I spoke to him about these questions based on the teaching of the Bible. By the time we finished, it was about ten o'clock. I was ready to go home, but he requested that I go into the sea to baptize him. (He was sprinkled as a baby.) When I heard this, I was taken by surprise and declined. Yet he insisted that I do it. After I thought about it over and over, I felt that I should not decline, and I went into the water and baptized him. After we did this, both of us were filled with joy in our hearts. God had led us this way, and through the circumstances above we met each other. Furthermore, we unintentionally ended up by the sea and happened to discuss the matter of baptism.</P><P>Two days later, two colleagues of mine at work, Mr. Tung and Mr. Ding, who had recently believed in the Lord (Mr. Ding being the brother of Brother Ding in the Shin-feng Company in Shanghai) heard about what had happened to Brother Lee. They came to me and asked me to baptize them. That evening I went to the sea and baptized them also. After these two incidents, God brought me in contact, on the street and at home, with other brothers almost every day. As a result of these contacts, on the Lord's Day after you left Chefoo, we began to break bread together. Before this meeting, we had three meetings in which I spoke briefly on the matter of the breaking of bread. The first and second time we broke bread, we had eleven brothers. The third time, we were going to have fourteen, but three of them were busy with their business and could not come. As a result eleven people were again present. The fourth time (the Lord's Day on the twenty-first of this month) we were going to have sixteen brothers, but two of them were not able to attend, and we broke bread with fourteen present. These brothers came out from the Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Chi-shan Church, the China Inland Mission, the Vine-hill Church, the Church of Christ in China, and the Bible Study. Some of them had been baptized before, and some of them had been sprinkled before. Some who had been sprinkled as babies came to be baptized. Some were sprinkled before they believed. When they believed, they wanted to be baptized. Some were neither baptized nor sprinkled before, and they were baptized by us. We have baptized six persons so far. Some of these brothers have asked for their names to be removed from the denominations, and some have severed their relationship with the denominations but have not yet removed their names. Some only come to our bread-breaking meeting, and go to the denominations for the other meetings, and still work in the denominations. Their professions include merchants, professors, preachers, students, workers, and clerks.</P><P>God has begun a work in Chefoo through useless vessels like us. We have witnessed many wonderful coincidences, which have forced us to acknowledge that this is God's own work and leading. Other than a few brothers whom we had arranged to meet ahead of time, most of the other brothers who are presently breaking bread with us came in contact with us accidentally.</P><P>I should have written you earlier, but because I have been very busy lately, I could not fulfill my wish. There are people I have to deal with almost every day. Now there are six meetings a week. I am responsible for all of them. Tuesday evening there is a prayer meeting. Thursday and Saturday evenings there are Bible study meetings. On the Lord's Day morning there is a message for general edification; in the afternoon there is a meeting for Bible study and prayer, and then we go out two by two to preach the gospel and pass out gospel tracts. In the evening, there is the table meeting. I have felt very weak lately and need to rest. The meeting place was not big enough because the sisters want to attend the table meeting and hear the messages. At this juncture my family found a new home with sixteen rooms. We can reserve three rooms for use in the meetings. We truly see God's preparation. These three rooms can hold at least fifty people. The brothers have already gone to prepare chairs. Thank and praise Him!</P><P>When we obey God in this way, it is difficult to avoid  ridicule and criticisms! Some people say we will not last. Some say we are too weak&mdash;without talent or money. But Isaiah 9:7 and 37:32, Nehemiah 4, and 1 Samuel 30:6 have strengthened me quite a bit. Please do not forget us in your prayers. I will write more later. May God bless us.</P><P>Your brother in Christ,<br>Witness Lee<br>August 27, 1932</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM SWATOW, KWANGTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>Dear Brother Luk:</P><P>(Parts omitted.)1 The meetings here have been deeply blessed by the Lord. The table meeting is on the Lord's Day morning at 8:30. There are more than thirty brothers and sisters. In the afternoon we have a gospel meeting at 3:30.  There are two hundred people listening to the message. This building is too small. It is very crowded every week. The brothers and sisters have decided to rent a larger place after our four month rental is up. They plan to prepare four hundred seats. If the Lord is willing, it will happen.</P><P>After nineteen people were baptized on May 8, seven more sisters obeyed the Lord and were baptized in August. I really thank the Lord; He is the One doing a good work in Swatow. Brother Luk, I am really in fear and trembling and do not know how to go on. I do not know many truths about the church. I cannot answer many questions about the church. We really need some teaching from you brothers!</P><P>Brother Nee sent a letter to me during my turn, teaching and exhorting me. It gave me much light. This type of teaching is very precious to me, a little brother from the mountains. Many brothers here know nothing about the truth concerning the church. Although Brother Nee has passed some teachings on to us, they were general and not detailed, so I beg you, brother, for the Lord's sake to take time out of your busy schedule to give me a letter with detailed teachings, so that we do not fall and shame the Lord's name. Brother Nee also wanted me to attend the next conference in Shanghai on the truth of the church. I am very honored that for the Lord's sake the brothers have not rejected one as low as me but are willing to teach and correct me!</P><P>Truly, Brother Luk, the situation of the world being as it is, what have I to be reluctant about in giving it up? The Lord is coming soon. May we faithfully serve Him in one accord according to the gift He has given us. May the Lord bless you all. Amen.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Tze Hang</P><P>October 4, 1933</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETINGS <br>IN CH'ANG-CH'UN, KIRIN PROVINCE, MANCHURIA</H2><P>Mr. Nee:</P><P>I received your letter. The matter of my future has already been resolved. In the latter part of August, the environment in the company did not allow me to continue working there.  At the same time, I was clear in prayer that it was God's will that I should quit my job and serve the Lord "full-time." So on August 25, I gave my resignation to the manager who came to Chefoo from Shanghai. The manager wanted me to wait until the end of September before leaving, so I agreed.</P><P>Thank God, the matter of my responsibilities toward my family has also been resolved. From now on, I do not have to bear any responsibility toward my extended family, and my extended family will not bear any responsibility for me, my wife, and my children.</P><P>The day after I gave my resignation, August 26, I received a letter from Sister Yu Su-chen. She urgently invited me to go work in Ch'ang-ch'un in Manchuria. Since I was clear about God's will, I finished settling the affairs of my company in order to free myself for Ch'ang-ch'un. Some affairs could not be settled immediately. I promised the company I would return to Chefoo at the end of September to take care of them. I left Chefoo on September 5 and arrived in Ch'ang-ch'un on the seventh. I stayed there for eighteen days. The Lord really blessed the work there. As a result, nine brothers and sixteen sisters obeyed the Lord and were baptized. Many had been sprinkled previously in the Ch'ang-ch'un Presbyterian Church. Among these nine brothers, two were elders of the Ch'ang-ch'un Presbyterian Church; one is Mr. T'ien P'in Fang, the manager of Ch'ang-ch'un Ch'ien Yi East Company. He is already more than fifty years old. He held four positions as a board member and one as a director of the board in the Presbyterian Church. Furthermore, he was their treasurer. Now he has resigned from all of these positions! He has also turned over his responsibility as the treasurer! The other one is Mr. An K'o Pai, the elder brother of Sister An. He is in the pharmaceutical business. He has also resigned from his position as elder. Among the obeying sisters, two were female preachers in the Presbyterian Church. There were also a few brothers and sisters who were newly saved and baptized. Before I went to Ch'ang-ch'un, Sister Yu had already done some work among the sisters. At the same time, God prepared these brothers and sisters through the environment. At that time, what they (especially the brothers) needed was the light of the truth. Once they saw the light, they obeyed. The second Lord's Day I was there, we had the table meeting in the Lord's name. We broke bread together with them twice.</P><P>When I was in Ch'ang-ch'un, I received a letter sent from my manager in Shanghai. In the letter, he asked me to continue working until the end of the year. He also promised to come to Chefoo to make new arrangements so that the situation of the company could allow me to continue working. But I am clear that if I go back to work, it will be unbelief and unfaithfulness. Therefore, I have decided to write a letter of refusal when I get back to Chefoo.</P><P>I left Ch'ang-ch'un on September 25 and returned to Chefoo on the twenty-seventh. When I arrived home, your letter was there. After reading it, I deeply sensed God's will in what you said in the last part. He wanted to confirm my personal subjective view with your objective view, so I boldly wrote a letter to my manager refusing his offer.</P><P>After my return to Chefoo, I returned to the company on September 28 to finish the work of transfer to my successor. Now I have made arrangements for almost everything. I can finish the matter in another three or four days.</P><P>Brother Huang Tzu Hou of Nan Su Chou sent me a letter (he is in Tientsin at the present) inviting me to Tientsin to stay for a few days. The Lord willing, I may go there to visit our brother.</P><P>The Gospel Paper has not been published yet! May the Lord bless this matter so that the paper can finally appear and enlighten some people in darkness. The trip I took to Manchuria showed me all the more the desperate need for the gospel!  Where are you now? How is your health? Will there be a conference in Shanghai this year or not? Hoping this finds you at peace!</P><P>Your respectful brother,<br>Witness Lee<br>October 10, 1933</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM <br>TSOU COUNTY, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>Miss Lee:</P><P>God's grace is sufficient for us. So we can only thank and praise concerning all the work and affairs. The temptation and pressure are great, but the grace is even greater. It seems that the Lord has opened a door for us recently. Mr. Yang, the chief guard at the Tsou County Official Prison came of his own accord to invite us into the prison to preach the gospel to the prisoners. We are just about to begin, and we are very much exercised about this endeavor. There are also some who are in one accord with us praying unceasingly for this matter. We are requesting prayer co-workers. If the brothers or sisters there have any teaching or direction from experience in this kind of work, we would be most happy to hear it.</P><P>I am still here in Tsou County and will not leave here for a while. It seems that in following the Lord, the more I learn, the more I am walking against the wind; each step is an effort. I am also very surprised that such a weak and corrupted person as I can still stand here today. This truly is the Lord's grace. May the Lord bless you with peace.</P><P>Sincerely,<br>Sun Shih Pi<br>October 26, 1933</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM TAISHAN, KWANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>To Sister Ruth Lee in the Lord:</P><P>(Parts omitted.) I am still teaching. When I have time, I do the Lord's work. Only three of the brothers in Taishan remember the Lord with us. Among them is Brother T'ang Yen Min. After Brother Lee (Brother Lee Pei Shun) came to Taishan, he read the first volume of The Spiritual Man and learned that denominations were a sin. He immediately left the denomination and his position as a preacher. Now he lives at 28 Kung Ho Market, Second Floor. He has a wife and children, so his daily expenses are great. He is not from a wealthy family. He has always been a professional preacher. Now that he has been called, he lives by faith in God. Thank God, He has given us a brother to bear the responsibility!</P><P>There are more than twenty people who break bread together with us here. There are sisters who are in their sixties and seventies and some who are in their teens. There are some who walk more than ten miles [Translator's note: References to miles in Volumes 25 and 26 refer to the Chinese unit of measurement, which is the approximate equivalent of one-third of a Western mile] on the Lord's Day to come to Kung Ho Market for the meeting. Although the roads in the rural country are very rough, they do not mind. This is the Lord's love! The brothers and sisters in Taishan are all at peace. Please do not worry!</P><P>Brother Lee has left the world to be with the Lord, and there is no better place to be. But we believers in Kwantung province have lost much help. May the brothers and sisters in Shanghai always remember us in prayer, praying and petitioning for us so that many believers in Taishan and Canton would have some raised up to bear the burden in the Lord's name.</P><P>We know a brother, who is twenty this year, called Liang Huei Hung. He is also in one accord with us. He lives in Canton. When Brother Lee was there, he did his best to help this brother. The brother's wife is not in the denominations. Unfortunately, this brother died ten days ago! In the past two months, we have lost two good brothers. We are very grieved. May God the Father preserve us, so that we may serve the Lord faithfully until we are raptured. Amen.

Ho</P><P>and Huang:</P><P>I have not corresponded with you for a long time, and my spirit misses you. I miss you, but even more I remember you when I pray. The brothers and sisters here also want to know how you are. The Present Testimony and Notes on Scriptural Messages have not been sent to us for quite a while. We do not know the reason.</P><P>Recently, we have been blessed by God and are learning to fight in our environment. For this reason, I have retired to live in a quiet straw hut to fellowship alone with God. Oh! How very good this is! Hymns #53, 67, 68, and 176 have become my personal hymns. I know that the trials are past and grace has come. The brothers and sisters here are very obedient to God, but they are immature and lacking in cultivation and watering. Please remember them before God. There are nine brothers and sisters who have been baptized here, and we have had the table meeting for five weeks. May God lead His children to come under His name as obedient children.

I really hope to come to next year's conference and receive the gift of the Father together with you, but I do not know whether or not the Lord will allow me to. A brother came to Peking, and the brothers and sisters here benefited quite a bit. It really was God answering our prayer. The word in Jeremiah 3:15 was fulfilled. I believe that He will continue to give us more grace.

But after believing, I realize that sufferings often come to individuals, misfortunes often come to families, and temptations and persecutions often arise. I do not know whether all these are the discipline of God or the attacks of Satan. What is God's discipline like? What is the work of Satan like? I do not understand yet. Please sir, give me definite and detailed instructions in the Lord. (Parts  omitted.)</P><P>From,<br>Wen Ching Yi</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Answering Letter</H2><P>Brother Ching Yi:</P><P>God's discipline and Satan's attacks do not look much different from the outside. This means that any matter which befalls us does not look much different outwardly. It means that sufferings, hardships, temptations, and attacks which come because of God's discipline are not different outwardly from the sufferings, hardships, temptations, and attacks which come from the attack of Satan. So how can we differentiate them? To differentiate them, we must ask who is behind these sufferings, hardships, temptations, and attacks. From the Bible, we see that God does not give these things directly to people. Satan is the one who gives them directly to people. Thus, when God disciplines people, He takes advantage of the work of Satan. Therefore, in Satan's work we see the discipline of God, and in God's discipline it is not hard to find Satan's work.</P><P>So what should our attitude toward these two matters be? First Peter 5:6-9 and James 4:7 teach us concerning this. These two passages of the Bible tell us to obey God and resist the devil. Please pay attention to the fact that the sequence in both passages is to obey God first and then resist the devil. Therefore, when we uncover any situation, we must never complain. We must not use our fleshly hands to quickly save ourselves from this situation. We should not do this. We should first humble ourselves before God, confessing that we accept this kind of situation because we have sinned. Furthermore, we should ask God to show us why He gave us this kind of situation and what teaching or lessons He wants us to learn from it. After we become clear, we should submit to these lessons. Then we should resist the works of Satan.</P><P>Please remember that we must come to this stage before we resist Satan. But when we have arrived at this stage we must resist Satan. If we do not resist Satan after we have obeyed God, we give ground to Satan. God is the disciplining Father, and the works of Satan are the whipping rod in His hand. If we do not obey God before we resist Satan, we are telling God that we are not willing to change according to His will and that we are trying to break the whipping rod in His hand. On the surface, it appears that we are resisting Satan, but actually we are resisting God. If we have obeyed God and do not resist Satan, it means that we have changed according to God's will, but we are still receiving His whipping. Please remember that the whip in God's hand is with a purpose. The devil wants us to continue to suffer after we have obeyed, so we must resist. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>The slave of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER TO BROTHER LAN CHIH YI</H2><P>Brother Chih Yi:</P><P>I received your letter. Thank you for your words of comfort to me! The slander of outsiders certainly means nothing. The Lord said, "Blessed are you when they reproach...you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you...rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens" (Matt. 5:11-12). However, it is a pity that the outsiders do not understand that our motivation in the Lord is to express the presence of the Lord Himself. They misunderstand us, thinking that we are only trying to draw people out of the denominations. I will answer the three questions you asked me separately with the following:</P><P>(1) The church cannot help a polygamous brother by doing anything more than forgiving him. When the Lord said that He loved mercy and abhorred sacrifices, He was referring to this matter. If the believers sinned in the matter of polygamy before they were saved, the Lord does not pursue the matter. Because no matter what the sin, whatever was committed before our regeneration is under the blood. Of course, the sin of polygamy is under the blood.</P><P>The question that has arisen in the church is whether the concubine he had should be driven out of the house. The Bible gives us some very clear light regarding this matter. Paul told Timothy, "The overseer [the elder] then must be...the husband of one wife...deacons must similarly be..." (1 Tim. 3:2, 8). So we know that among the believers at that time, there were those who were the husband of two wives. For this reason, Paul said that only the husbands of one wife could be elders and deacons. The reason the apostle said this word was to show that if a man had two wives, he could still be a believer, but he could not bear any responsibility in the church.</P><P>Furthermore, the sin of polygamy is different from other sins. There are two kinds of sin. One kind of sin can be restituted, the other cannot. The sin of polygamy cannot be restituted. For example, stolen items can be returned to their owner. But if you have married someone's daughter, you cannot return her. Therefore, if you want to send this woman away, you are telling her to be an adulteress. So it would be better if the husband bowed down under God's government and bore this responsibility.</P><P>In the Old Testament, David married Bathsheba. God did not tell David to separate from Bathsheba. Furthermore, she bore Solomon. Our Lord Jesus came out of her. Exodus 21:7-11 speaks of the position of a concubine. In this passage, the other wife refers to the proper wife, the maidservant is a concubine. The position God gives the concubine is that her food, her clothing, and her duty of marriage shall not be diminished.</P><P>(2) Regarding the question about Acts 19:1-7, we should first see what this passage means when it refers to the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not mentioned here in reference to regeneration or indwelling. Regeneration and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit are not obtained through the laying on of hands of the apostles. From the following portion, which speaks of tongues and prophecies, etc., we see that the Holy Spirit spoken of here refers to the gift of the Holy Spirit. The disciples at Ephesus were already regenerated and already had the Holy Spirit indwelling them. They only lacked the gift of the Holy Spirit. Gift is related to the Body (1 Cor. 12). The baptism of repentance causes us to be related to the Lord Jesus. The baptism into the Lord Jesus causes us to have a part in His Body. Therefore, it was not enough for them to receive the baptism of repentance; they still had to be baptized into the name of the Lord before they could receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>(3) Regarding Revelation 3:5, it is possible to have one's name erased from the book of life. We must differentiate between not being written in the book of life and having one's name erased from the book of life. A person who never gets saved or regenerated does not have his name written in the book of life. A person whose name is erased from the book of life is saved and regenerated, but he is not an overcomer. The former perishes for eternity. The latter does not participate in the kingdom. The last part of Revelation 20 refers to eternity; Revelation 2&mdash;3 refers to the kingdom.

(1 Cor. 12:3).</P><P>We have previously held two conferences of the same nature, one in February of 1928 and one in October of 1931. The conference held in November of last year was of a different nature, and for that reason we consider the upcoming conference to be the third overcomer conference.</P><P>I want all the brothers to understand the nature of this type of conference; no attention will be paid to the less significant matters of the Bible. What we want to see in the Holy Spirit is Christ and Him crucified. Matters such as prophecy, church organization, Scripture exposition, types, baptism, laying on of hands, speaking in tongues, miracles, and a hundred other questions have their proper place. As Christians we should not deny them their proper place. However, these are neither the center of the Scriptures nor the center of the life of the Holy Spirit. God has only one center, which is Christ&mdash;Christ and Him crucified. Our annual conferences of this nature are to bring us back to this center. Therefore, we are reluctant to mention any minor matters in these conferences. Rather, we would emphasize only the central point which God Himself stressed.</P><P>Many people often ask us why The Present Testimony does not print some of the articles similar to those in the previous magazine, The Christian. However, they do not realize that The Present Testimony only delivers the central message of God. Many of the gospel messages, interpretations of prophecy, Bible expositions, and answers to questions are not God's center. It is a pity that many believers treasure our writings on these side issues, but neglect the central message. We are not saying that the other subjects are useless; they do have their place. However, they are not the center. If a person has not laid hold of God's center, all these truths will only be doctrines to him and will not give him any help. Knowing God in His center, and living in the center is victory, holiness, and glory. Everything else follows afterward.</P><P>In our conference this time, as before, we wish to lay stress on the central message. After much prayer I feel the theme which the Lord has given me for this conference is "God's Overcomers." Everything in the conference will focus on this center. Since the dates are now set, I ask all the brothers to pray more for this conference. Unlike the conference in 1928, our conferences in 1931 and 1932 were both lacking in prayer. Consequently, we saw no obvious blessing in those meetings. We should, therefore, ask God for a burden to pray and for a spirit of prayer. We need to pray and pray fervently. Perhaps we even have to fast and pray. However, we must pray in the Holy Spirit! Whether or not God will bless us depends upon our prayer.</P><P>Finally, in this conference, our hope is to meet Christ, to receive light and revelation from heaven, and to be filled with the life that is unknown to ordinary people. We do not intend to pay attention to the many minor, outward matters. "To know Him" (Phil. 3:10)&mdash;this is what we seek.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Watchman Nee<br>December 13, 1933</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A FEW MATTERS CONCERNING THE CONFERENCE</H2><P>Because many friends from distant places do not have friends or family in Shanghai to stay with and our place is not the most spacious, there are many things that are lacking. If there is any lack in our hospitality, I ask you ahead of time to forgive us!</P><P>With regard to the price of meals, we do not set a price, nor do we determine not to accept money. We only ask for voluntary help according to the ability of the brothers and sisters attending the conference and the Lord's leading. In this way, he who has much will have no surplus, and the poor will have no lack.</P><P>Any brother or sister coming to the conference should please pay attention to the following points:</P>	<ol class="decimal">	<li>We hope that whoever is not clear that he is saved or is saved but does not seek the Lord with hunger and thirst will not come. The nature of our conference is not for the unsaved, nor is it for the undesiring.

We have not corresponded with you for a long time; we are really sorry. We received your letter yesterday and were very comforted. We received great light, and we prayed for you. We hope that Collection of Newsletters can be published soon, so that the Lord may be glorified and all the beloved ones can receive the benefit.</P><P>My disposition (Hsi Lin) is to hide myself, so I usually have an attitude of not wanting others to know but only wanting the Lord to know. So you who are as dear to me as a teacher but who treat me like a fellow student do not know how the meetings here (Kuai Huo Lin Street, Ling Tzu) began, what their condition is, and how the work is, etc. Since receiving your letter, I have had a deep feeling of doing a kind of wrong to the extent that the beloved in the Lord cannot pray for us, cannot thank, cannot correct, cannot give all the glory to God. So I take the opportunity of this day in which we have both been exhorted and encouraged to joyfully mention these things, so that those who love us will know.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Origin of Our Meetings</H2><P>We began meeting in this place almost two years ago. It began as the work of the Holy Spirit in us. We felt we had a burden. We felt that in the corrupted denomination (the denomination in Ling Tzu is Baptist), in the human organization, there was no real worship of God, and there was even less freedom for the development of the truth! However, at the time, there were only two people in one accord, myself and Yuan Ling Shu. (At that time Chin Chou was in Chefoo.) Five months before the meetings began, there were four or five in one accord. The way we adopted for our need at that time was not to let man know but only to tell our Father. Offerings were made voluntarily; we never exhorted anyone to give. Thank the Lord; what He had prepared for us was very complete and appropriate for our number. It was a small courtyard and two dilapidated buildings, one for the brothers and one for the sisters. There were two old tables, one for the brothers and one for the sisters, and four short benches. We met principally to worship God and to study the Bible. By human standards, we would have been satisfied with six or seven people! However, within the first half month of meeting, we had seven brothers and sisters in one accord. With everyone in one accord, we seemed to be moved by one Spirit and joyfully met together; this met the need at that time. On the fourth day of the twelfth month of the Chinese calendar in 1931, we had the first meeting in the Lord's name to "worship God." Although the number was small, we were all very joyful and the sound of thanksgiving was among us. "For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst." The Lord was among us; we were joyful and satisfied. Nevertheless, we did not understand anything of the truth. We knew almost nothing of the matter of the church, so it was difficult to avoid errors. But those meeting with us just had a heart to fear and please the Lord. Thank God; He blessed us, for He had prepared His servant ahead of time to gradually give us the light of all His truths (most of it from Notes on Scriptural Messages) to shine among us. The shining became brighter and brighter, until it shone as the sun at noon. In the end we were led to obey Him. In March of that year (1932), four brothers (Yuan Hsi Ling, Yuan Ling Shu, Yuan Hsi Chang, Chu Lo Yuan) and one sister (Chu Ai Jung) left the denominations. Once we did this, the denominations began to oppose, ridicule, and despise us. (When we first met, they thought it was a game and were not offended.) Their propaganda became stronger, and they said we were only a Bible study group. But our joy was the Lord, and we were obeying the Bible. Therefore, we stood firmly on the Bible. At this time, a wind of heresy blew (Pentecostalism), but the Lord had helped us long ago with the topic of the sealing of the Holy Spirit, so we were not affected.</P><P>During this section of the way, I had two wrong concepts: (1) I looked for help from man, but the help of man cannot be relied upon; God caused me to rely only on Him. (2) In the battle with the denominations, I was secretly trying to glorify myself, but God also let me know that this is a very big sin and is very abominable. Thank the Lord! We overcome by relying on the washing and forgiveness of His precious blood.</P><P>In 1933 two brothers (Yuan Chin Chou, Yuan Hsi Ting) and two sisters (Chu En Chao and the mother of Yuan Ling Shu) gradually left the denominations in order to please the Lord and because they hated sects. In March three brothers and one sister were baptized in the Tzu River (behind the dock at Chao Wang Farm). In May a total of nine brothers and sisters were baptized (behind the dock at the Yu family farm) in the Tzu River. The baptizing one was one who had believed and been baptized. But these thirteen people asked the brother to baptize them; the baptizing brother did not take the initiative to ask them to get baptized.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Condition of the Meetings</H2><P>When we first began meeting, to avoid being identified with all the other churches, either great or small (we were only half a mile away from a denomination), we called ourselves the Bible Study Place. But this was slightly in error because our meeting should not be called by some local names or be named after a method. Such a name was not really appropriate. In order to obey the truth, we took down and destroyed the sign that said, "Bible Study Place."</P><P>Previously the Lord's Day morning meeting had a definite person to lead our worship. Because the brothers were mainly immature, we had someone who was temporarily responsible. We no longer do this because we are afraid that it would become our habit to have a meeting in a person's name!</P><P>We used to have a Bible study meeting on the Lord's Day afternoon, but for several months we have changed it to a table meeting. (There are difficulties with meeting in the evening.) The word "to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin" operated within us; therefore, we had no choice but to obey. Thank the Lord! Recently there are two who desire to break bread with us, but because they are not clearly saved, we have not allowed them to join us yet. Now there are twenty people in the meetings regularly, with fourteen who break bread together.</P><P>There used to be only one offering box. Now there are two. One is for the meetings, and one is for the work. Those who have received the grace to be elders collect the offerings for both the meetings and the work, and they work with those who have the grace to be deacons to determine how to spend the money. We do not have to ask or check what they do. We also thank God that in October 1932 at 10 South Kuan a Bible study meeting was started on Tuesday afternoons. Up to this year it has never stopped, no matter how busy the autumn harvest has been. Now there is a meeting near the South Gate in Yuan Ling Shu's house (Yuan Ling Shu is now in Anhwei Su County) for the gospel. In the north of the city at the Tsue family farm and at the South Gate and South Kuan, there are home meetings every evening. South Kuan also has two evenings for prayer meetings (Monday and Saturday). On the Lord's Day, we all meet together in the Lord's name. There are hymns or teachings according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. We worship God freely. We can all prophesy one by one, so that all can learn the truth and be encouraged. It is not in confusion but in quietness with temperance. Hallelujah, praise the Lord! He causes us to obey Him in all these matters, so that we may please Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>With Regard to the Work</H2><P>We used to place much emphasis on the visitation work, but recently we have put equal emphasis on the gospel work. Recently, we have gone to the Yu Family Farm. (This is a small village with a strong denomination. There are many who belong to it. There are two deacons and one clerk. It is eight miles from the city.) Some people there received the truth. The most enlightened ones are Yu Bao Min and his father Hsiou Cheng. Yu is free from prejudice or position, and he is about the same age as Ching Chou. The meeting is in their house. Although Bao Min has not been baptized, he is definitely a believer because he deeply believes the Bible and gladly receives all truth. In this village, there are those who have left the denomination and those who want to leave the denomination because they do not want to make donations or attend the Sunday worship. We have spoken with them and feel that the situation is generally good.</P><P>Ching Chou also visited the Hsueh's home about eight miles to the east of the city. According to flesh, they are relatives, but they are unbelievers. However, his cousins were receptive and learned to pray and give thanks before eating. There was a teacher in the village who was from Li Kuan Village. His name is San Min Tzu. He is twenty-two years old and is an unbaptized believer. He received the truth like Yu Bao Min. Chin Chou was introduced by a cousin to Li Kuan Village (this village is close to the Hsueh's home). He went to his own relative's home and preached the gospel; then he went into San Min Tzu's house. It was a believing home, but they had been forgotten by the denominations. There was also a sister in the Hsueh's home that had been forgotten by the denominations. Then he went to Nieh Hsien Village, which is a place we visit often. Its condition was not very good because not many obeyed the truth. Then he went to Zao Wang Village, and many people received the truth, but unfortunately they received it almost as if it were a kind of philosophy.</P><P>Wang Ts'un Shu, who lives thirty miles to the east at the small rapids, has been reading the Bible by himself for three years. He has never been polluted by the denominations, and very few people have contacted him. He really is like a lily of the valley.</P><P>In the villages of Chu Liang and Tuan Town (these two villages are very close together with many women believers) about thirty-five miles to the east of town are two people, Wei Ch'un Fang and Wang Hou T'ing, who were leaders of the denomination. Because they entered the Pentecostal movement, they were rejected by the denomination. But Messrs. Wei and Wang both received the truth to the uttermost. They came to the city and stayed for two or three days talking with us before they were clearly saved. Thank the Lord for this.</P><P>Three miles south of the city in Nan Ma Fang, Chia Fu Ch'in (twenty-four or twenty-five) and his father, Wen Meng, both desire the truth. Chia Fu Ch'in was baptized when he was a teacher in Kao Mi County, but he does not understand anything. They have contacted us. There are a few people in their village who have also begun to desire the truth.</P><P>Thirty-five miles to the west of the city in Pei Kao Yang, there are a few people who have believed the word for many years but who are just now beginning to understand salvation. There are also the villages of Wu T'ai, Shih Fen Kuan Village, and Mao Chia T'un. Some there have just begun to seek, and some have believed in the Lord for many years but do not understand.</P><P>Nieh Tao Hung is in Mao Wang Village to the west of Kuang Jao. He is now home. We do not know him but have heard Yuan Ling Shu mention his history. A few days ago we sent a letter to him. When we receive something from him, we will tell you more about him. In the area of the work, we feel that the harvest is great, but the workers are few. The sisters are even fewer. We also feel that we should not argue with those who do not believe the Bible. We should treat the older ones in the denominations as if they were our fathers, lest we place a stumbling block before them and deprive ourselves of the authority to preach the gospel to them again. We can now go in and out of the parish of the denomination freely and are welcomed by all the laity (those without any position). We only hope there is more prayer for the meeting and work here so that more people will be raised up to bear the burden, preach salvation, worship God, and remember the Lord. May honor and glory be richly given to the Lamb until eternity. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Questions</H2><P>In the table meetings, some of the sisters who break bread with us carry or bring their children to the meetings. They are often noisy and bother the people in the meeting. We do not know what is an appropriate way to deal with this. We also have a few questions that we do not want to write to you in ink. May the Lord bless us so that in the upcoming meeting, we will have the opportunity to speak with you face to face.</P><P>We especially greet Brothers Chang Kuang Jung, Tu Chung Ch'un, Ho Yue Chiao, Huang Tsai Ching, John Wu, Chou Hsin Yi, and we greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</P><P>Your brothers in the Lord,<br>Yuan Ching Chou<br>Yuan Hsi Ling<br>December 14, 1933</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM DAIREN, MANCHURIA</H2><P>To Brother Hsin Yu in the Lord:</P><P>I have received all your letters, and I am acquainted with the condition of the brothers and sisters there. Truly His will is different from our will. To those who do not obey, it appears that God is really contrary to man in every place. But to those who have already obeyed, we just have to say, "Father, Your will be done." Throughout history, who has blocked God's will? (See Job 4:2-3.)</P><P>I am still much pressed physically. Sometimes I can hardly stand it. But I still want to thank Him even with tears because He still enables me to stand. There has been a change in my environment. Beginning on the twenty-third of this month, I have been transferred to work in the P'u Lan Tien (about one hundred twenty miles from Dairen). Although this is a transfer, I was thinking about going myself anyway, because there is not much of a way for me to do the Lord's work in Dairen. Most people here pursue the comforts of the soul, and not many are willing to obey God and walk the narrow way. I have been in Dairen for exactly two months and have only gained two brothers. They are brothers Chiang Ch'uan Ch'ing and Chang Wen Wei; both are beloved by the Lord. May the Lord protect them so that they can testify for the truth. Whatever happens, the truth of the church in Dairen has already begun. May the Lord bless His own work. Amen.</P><P>I am quite active in this place through His power. I know that Satan is fighting fiercely. I ask the brothers and sisters to please pray for the Lord's work here in their meetings, to resist the devil more. (Parts omitted.) Peace to you. I greet all the brothers.</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Chang Chun Ming<br>November 28, 1933</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM MR. WANG CHING SHENG</H2><P>(This was sent by a Mr. Wang Ching Sheng who works in the Min Ai Hospital in Nan Kuan, Su County, Anhwei Province to his pastor, and a copy was sent to us. We have never seen Mr. Wang. This is his story of obeying the truth.)</P><P>Dear Pastor:</P><P>I was led by the Lord's Spirit to walk in the Lord's way. I was enlightened and did not dare to refuse. If I am a little late, I am afraid it is from sin again. I have decided to leave the system of the denominations, because the system of the denominations is not according to the teachings of the Bible. I cannot return to the denominations to be a lukewarm layman. I want to be a solid believer and walk by following the Lord's light. The Lord is the lamp to my feet and the light to my path. Wherever the Lord leads me, I will go. I cannot follow my own will, because it is God who operates in me both the willing and the working for His good pleasure. I hope you will cross my name off the roster. When we meet, we cannot lose our civility. Our feeling for each other is the same as it always was and always will be. Different people have different views because the gift God has given each one is different. No matter what, we should perfect the saints for the work of the ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ. All the brothers and sisters in the Lord should hold forth the word of life to this perverted generation, which does not obey the truth, but obeys human affections. If we love God, we should be the children of God without blemish. This is what pleases the Father. I hope that you can forgive your little brother. It is not pride, nor is it jealousy, nor is it division. I write this to notify you.

(Parts omitted.)</P><P>By the Lord's grace, we now meet to remember the Lord every Lord's Day afternoon. There are eight sisters altogether. Three sisters have just been raised up to follow the Lord (teachers at Ts'ung Teh Girls' School). We did not invite them to the meeting; they came to meet with us of their own accord. This really shows that the Lord has heard our prayer and worked by leading them to rise up to take the way of obedience. May the Lord fully gain them. Oh, we really feel we are empty and impotent in ourselves; we cannot bring His children to follow Him. We can only pray that He does the work and raises up His children in Ning Po to come and obey Him so that He may be glorified. Even more we hope that the Lord will raise up brothers who can bear the responsibility for the meetings so that we can have the table meeting. Sisters, please pray for this matter also.</P><P>Thank the Lord, my physical strength is much better than before. Although the pain in my abdomen has increased, I can pass through everything by relying on the Lord. I believe that everything will come to pass according to His Word. Oh, by His faithfulness, I have a living hope. May He lead me to learn the lesson He wants me to learn; may I learn it well in order to please Him and so that I may get up again to serve Him with my remaining time. I ask the Lord to bless you with peace.</P><P>Your sister,<br>Yu Hua<br>January 3, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM KWANGCHOW,<br>KWANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>To the beloved sister in the Lord, Sister Lee:</P><P>Thank the Father God for His grace. He leads us day by day. He teaches us to see that the world is temporary, but reality is in Him. He really is our Savior, and He saves us to the uttermost. How has your health been recently? I am sure that your work has been blessed by the Lord.</P><P>Two other sisters and I, one who is a colleague of mine, Miss Lu Ai Chen, and Sister Liu Lien Hsin, have a meeting every Lord's Day evening. Our hearts are completely happy. Thank the Lord that He is with us and leads us Himself. I hope that you also remember us often and ask the Lord to glorify Himself and ask God Himself to do a deep work so that we might completely turn to Him as His most beloved children. May He gain more people. (Parts omitted.) May the Lord bless you.</P><P>Your sister in the Lord,<br>Wei Ch'ing<br>January 7, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM NORTHERN KIANGSU,<br>KIANGSU PROVINCE</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters who faithfully love the Lord:</P><P>When the news came about starting Collection of Newsletters, we few weak ones were both joyful and watchful. We were joyful that we could receive comfort from the news of the brothers in other places. We were watchful that we would not steal the glory from the Lord. Therefore, we want to give the glory to the Lord on the one hand, and on the other hand, we want to let the brothers and sisters know our condition in the region of northern Kiangsu. Today we will list all the places in northern Kiangsu that have meetings in the Lord's name and the names of the responsible brothers in these places. We hope to establish fellowship in the Lord and ask that the Lord strengthen us so that we may completely obey the truth. We also ask the Lord to bless this newsletter that it may give much glory to God. Amen!</P><P>The northern region of Kiangsu province used to be the territory of all the denominations. We were also members of a denomination and saw that the administration in the denominations was not according to the Bible in many points. Doubts often arose in us. Since we went to Shanghai to attend a conference in the middle of February 1928, we were enlightened by the Holy Spirit concerning our previous "doubts." They were answered one by one. After we returned, we were more enlightened by God and knew, for the most part, that sectarianism is contrary to the principles of the Bible, so we boldly and absolutely left the denominations. We started to meet in the Lord's name in Yi Ling. Then we continued in Su Chia Tsui, Ta Ch'iao, and other places. We also gradually established the Lord's table in these places. At that time there were more than one hundred brothers and sisters in the meetings.</P><P>In April 1931, Brothers Wu Wei and Chi Yung T'ung were together in Shanghai and testified in the Lord's Day meeting concerning the condition of the meetings in the Lord's name in northern Kiangsu (it has already been printed in Notes on Scriptural Messages). In October 1931, we attended the second conference in Shanghai bringing ten brothers with us. At that time there were nine places with the Lord's table in northern Kiangsu and more than three hundred people attended the breaking of the bread. In April 1932, we went to Shanghai for a meeting again. At that time northern Kiangsu already had fourteen different table meetings with more than five hundred people breaking bread together.</P><P>Now there are nineteen places with the Lord's table and about six hundred people breaking bread in them. About twenty percent came out of denominations; eighty percent are sinners called by the Lord. This entire situation has been raised up by the Lord Himself. This has been the result of works by the co-worker brothers and sisters and the prayer of the brothers and sisters who love the Lord. It is nothing we few weak, little ones could have done.</P><P>Thank the Lord! He has put us in the last age and made us able to stand for Him to testify for His testimony. May the Lord bless His work more strongly so that His glory and authority will not be hindered. I also hope the brothers and sisters will not forget to pray for us so that the Lord's grace will be manifested more greatly until the end of the age. Amen.</P><P>The slaves of Christ,<br>Wu Wei, Chiu Jih Chien, Chi Yung Feng, Chi Yung T'ung, Ting Yi Yuan<br>January, 1934</P><P>The list of the meetings in the Lord's name in the region of Fu Ning County, northern Kiangsu province:</P><div align="center"><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="75%"><tr><td width="25%"><span class="bd">Meeting Place</span></td><td width="25%"><span class="bd">Responsible Brothers</span></td><td width="25%"><span class="bd">Address</span></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Fu Ning County</td><td valign="top">P'ei Ta Sheng</td><td>Fu Ning Ta Sheng<br>Hospital</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Yi Ling Town,<br>Fu Ning</td><td>Wu Wei,<br>Hsu Shou Huei</td><td>Yi Ling Town,<br>Chiangpei, Kiangsu</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ban Hu,<br>Fu Ning</td><td>Tsou Ts'ai Kao,<br>Ts'ai Yun Hsien</td><td>c/o Wu Wei, Yi Ling,<br>Chiangpei, Kiangsu</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Su Chia Tsui,<br>Fu Ning</td><td>Lee Yung T'ung,<br>Chi Yung Feng,<br>Chiu Jih Chien</td><td>Su Chia Tsui,<br>Chiangpei</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Tung Kou,<br>Fu Ning</td><td>Hu Chih Lan</td><td>Tung Kou, Fu Ning,<br>Chiangpei</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ch'ing Kou,<br>Fu Ning	</td><td valign="top">Yen Jen Ch'in,	<br>Lee Kuo Chang</td><td valign="top">Ch'ing Kou, Fu Ning,<br>Chiangpei</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chen Chia,<br>Yue Tze, Fu Ning</td><td valign="top">Chen Yung K'uan</td><td valign="top">Su Chia Tsui,<br>Chiangpei</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Lien Shui County</td><td valign="top">Ting Chung Shu</td><td valign="top">South Headquarters,<br>Lien Shui Public<br>Security Office</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Yin Han Village,<br>Lien Shui</td><td valign="top">Han Shang Chen</td><td valign="top">see above</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sun Family Bridge,<br>Lien Shui</td><td valign="top">Chi Ju Chun,<br>Sun Yu Kang</td><td valign="top">c/o Ting Chung Shu</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chang Chia,<br>Wa Tze,<br>Lien Shui</td><td valign="top">Chang Jung Yang,<br>Chang Chang<br>Kao Yang,<br>Chang Wei Yang</td><td valign="top">c/o Chi Yung T'ung<br>Su Chia Tsui,<br>Chiangpei</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ta Ch'iao,<br>Huai An</td><td valign="top">Ting Yi Yuan</td><td valign="top">same as above</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chu Chia K'ou,<br>Huai An</td><td valign="top">Niu Mai Chen<br>Chang Tien Keng<br>Kao Hung Ju</td><td valign="top">Chu Chia Kou, c/o<br>Hsia Shao Bing Shop<br>Cheng Kung Bridge<br>down Huai An River</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ke Chia Village,<br>Huai An	</td><td valign="top">Ke Fang Ying,	<br>Ke Hsin San</td><td valign="top">same as above</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ma Bao,<br>Huai An</td><td valign="top">Chia Ying Chung,<br>Hsu Wen Hsiu</td><td valign="top">same as above</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chen An Yu,<br>Huai An</td><td valign="top">Chen Ju Yi</td><td valign="top">Ma Chang Chen Yu,<br>Huai An</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ta Tung Village,<br>Huai An</td><td valign="top">Ma Yun Ju</td><td valign="top">Huai An Chin Kung</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Liu Village,<br>Hsin Hua County</td><td valign="top">Chu Yang Chih</td><td valign="top">Hsin Hua,<br>Liu Village<br>Fu Lai Tea Company</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Tung Tai County</td><td valign="top">Yuan Han Chen</td><td valign="top">Jen Ho Hsiang Hao,<br>Tung Tai</td></tr></table></div><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER TO BROTHER CHIANG SHUN TIEN</H2><P>Brother Shun Tien:</P><P>In the Bible, there is no clear word that places baptism and breaking bread together. Nor does it say that baptism is a condition for taking the table. However, from the Bible, it seems that those who have not been baptized may not take the table. (1) The example in the Bible shows us that on the night the Lord was betrayed, all those who took the table together had been baptized. After Pentecost, all those who took the table had been baptized also. Therefore, from these two examples in the Bible, it seems that one who is not baptized should not partake of the table. (2) According to the meaning of baptism and the table, it requires one to be baptized first and then partake of the table because baptism is to enter into the death, burial, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus. The table meeting manifests the Lord's death by remembering the Lord until He comes again. If a person has not entered into the Lord's death, how can he manifest such death? If a person does not become part of the Lord, how can he remember the Lord? Baptism implies our initial union with the Lord. The table meeting implies our continuing union with Him. Baptism implies our initial entrance into the Lord's death. The table meeting represents our lasting entrance into His death. Baptism causes us to enter into Christ. The table meeting represents our constant abiding in Him. Therefore, we are only baptized once, but the table meeting occurs many times. Baptism represents our entrance, while the table meeting represents our walk. The order in the Bible is to enter the door first and then walk on the way. Thus, we see that we should be baptized first and then take the table.</P><P>Furthermore, we should remember that the believers spoken of in the Bible were all baptized immediately upon genuine faith in the Lord. No one who genuinely believed in the Lord and had His life waited to go through many processes before he was baptized. Furthermore, everyone in the Bible who believed in the Lord was immersed into water. No one went through the ritual of sprinkling, where water was sprinkled from a person's hand onto someone's head, as is practiced today. Therefore, the believers in the Bible were all baptized by immersion. Their believing and baptism were never separated. These two matters occurred within a very short period of time. We can say that once they believed, they were baptized. We know that only those who believe the Lord can come break bread to remember the Lord. Therefore, believers are those who have been baptized. By this we know that all those who partake of the table must be ones who are baptized. In the Bible the two matters of believing and being baptized are not separated in time. Therefore, in their meetings, the question of whether or not the people partaking of the table should be baptized ones never arose. As soon as they believed, they were baptized. Then they partook of the table.</P><P>Nevertheless, if a person truly believes in the Lord but has not been baptized by immersion, if he has only been baptized by the sprinkling ritual, can this person partake of the table? He can. The teaching of the Bible is that those who have not been baptized cannot partake of the table. However some people do not understand that the baptism referred to in the Bible is a baptism by immersion. They think that baptism by sprinkling, which they have received, is the baptism spoken of in the Bible. In the eyes of this kind of believer, they have already been baptized. Although we know the baptism they have received is not the baptism referred to in the Bible and although we know that it does not count before the Lord, it is a question of knowledge and light. We cannot refuse someone because he does not have knowledge. We cannot refuse to allow him to break bread and fellowship with us. The Bible says that we should accept all those whom the Lord has accepted. "Now him who is weak in faith receive,...for God has received him" (Rom. 14:1-3). Although one who has been baptized by sprinkling has not really been baptized, the Lord has received him; He has not rejected him because he has not been baptized by immersion. Since our Lord is willing to receive him and give him life, we certainly should also accept him and fellowship with him. The Lord receives him because he has faith, not because he has been baptized. "Therefore receive one another, as Christ also received you..." (15:7). We should also receive him because he has faith. Christ does not reject him because he has not been baptized by immersion. Our receiving others is based on only one principle: "God has received him." Whomever God has received, we should also receive. We should not look at whether or not he has been baptized by immersion. Therefore, if someone has believed in the Lord, received eternal life and been baptized by sprinkling rather than by immersion as the Bible says, we should receive him. Even if he has not even been baptized by sprinkling (like those of the Quaker denomination and the Salvation Army, etc.) and thinks that he does not need to be baptized, we cannot refuse to fellowship and break bread with him, because God has received this person.</P><P>Finally, the Bible teaches us that: (1) baptism should be by immersion, (2) the table should be taken after baptism, and (3) we should receive people to the table only on the ground that God has received them. Some who have not been baptized, or whose baptism is not according to the baptism by immersion in the Bible, should still be received by us. Our attitude is that anyone who has genuinely believed in the Lord can be baptized immediately. After baptism, they can partake of the table. If a person has not been baptized yet still comes and asks to take the table with us, we should advise him to wait awhile and then take the table with us. If he insists on taking the table immediately, we should allow him to partake of it. With those who have been sprinkled, whose baptism was not according to the Bible, we should allow them to take the table with us, but we should show them in the Bible that baptism by immersion is the baptism that is scriptural. In conclusion, in receiving people, we should only look at whether or not they have life and whether or not they have committed the sin in 1 Corinthians 5. As to other matters that are not according to the Bible, we should exhort the ones who practice them and hope that they will wait. But if they will not wait, we cannot refuse them.</P><P>The slave of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANNOUNCEMENT</H2><P>All the brothers and sisters who fellowship with us and who want this publication should write to us so that we can add them to our mailing list.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ISSUE NO. 3</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>February&mdash;March 1934</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BEGINNING AND HISTORY OF THE MEETINGS<br>IN NAN KANG AND P'U MEN IN P'ING YANG COUNTY<br>OF CHEKIANG PROVINCE AND OF OTHER MEETINGS<br>IN NORTHERN FUKIEN PROVINCE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Six Localities in Nan Kang</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Ch'iao Tun Men</H2><P>Ch'iao Tun Men is an important town between Fukien and Chekiang. (Less than twenty miles to the southwest is Feng Shiu Ling. It borders Tai Shun to the west and Fu Ting to the south.) It is a hub of business and also the most centrally located place among the churches in our three counties.</P><P>In 1928 when Brothers Chang Wu Sheng and Wang T'ien Tso (Brother Wang T'ien Tso passed away on Wu Tai Mountain on December 12 of last year) returned from Shanghai, the Spirit of God enlightened and led them, causing them to walk in a way they had never walked before. At that time there were only a few brothers meeting in a rented house. The Spirit of the Lord did a great work. People came from Wu Tai Mountain and Wan Yao to hear the Word. Many received grace and were saved. Between the fall of that year and the following January, there were two special prayer meetings. Many brothers and sisters who loved the Lord and who were seeking the truth came from P'u Men, Chiang Nan, Tai Sun, Fu Ting, or from other places both near and far in our area. All prayed steadfastly together with one accord and the Lord poured out extra grace, leading them to much edification. This was the beginning of our meeting which came fully under the Lord's name. Now the brothers and sisters in Wu Tai Mountain and Wan Yao meet in either Wu Tai Mountain or in Ting Pu T'ou, close to Wan Yao. The church in Ch'iao Tun Men is very isolated. There are only five brothers and sisters in the table meeting. (Recently, there are a little more than twenty people including those listening to the gospel and newly saved ones who have not been baptized.) This year Brother Chang Wu Sheng is being tested greatly. On the evening of January 26, his grocery store was completely burned down. In addition, his family (his father, mother, wife, and children) has become very sick. But by the Lord's grace, he still carries the lone burden of the work in the church in Ch'iao Tun Men. Within the last four or five months, six or seven brothers from a certain denomination in Kuan Mei (about fifteen miles south of Ch'iao Tun Men) have voluntarily left the denominations through the Holy Spirit's work. They have not yet rented a place to meet. There are still many difficulties, and it is very important for the work to continue. We hope the brothers and sisters who love the Lord will pray for this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Ting Pu T'ou</H2><P>The locality of Ting Pu T'ou is about thirty miles northwest of Ch'iao Tun Men. In 1931 we preached the gospel there, and God worked immediately. Two of those listening were saved. One was Brother Hsieh Ch'ung Ch'ang. After he was saved, he lacked the nurturing in the truth, so he was greatly attacked by evil spirits. They almost killed him. The worst experience was recently; Satan brought him to lie down on the treadle of a sewing machine and started to lower the upper stone treadle that looks like a large ingot onto him to crush him. Suddenly the power of God caused the stone to fly outward, so he was not injured at all. Thank the Lord for leading him to overcome. Since this he has been very zealous to glorify the Lord's name. In the winter of 1931, Brother Chang Wu Sheng and I (Yu T'ing) felt deeply that the meeting there was very crucial and were praying about it. The Lord gave us a building with seven rooms. There are also two buildings to the left and right and a vegetable garden. It faces the water and has its back to the mountains. The area is very quiet. In March of 1932 we moved in to meet. Now there are ten brothers and two sisters at the table meetings. They all are recently saved. There are also a few brothers who have life and are ready to be baptized. There is a brother called Lin Yu Kao who is a young scholar. He came to hear the word in June of this year and was regenerated. He also had what seemed to be tuberculosis, but at that time, he was cured. He is experiencing Christ's resurrection life day by day, and he has never stopped praying, reading the Bible, and keeping morning watch. May the brothers in the Lord pray especially for this brother that he might go on and be able to help the meeting there.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Chu Hsi</H2><P>Chu Hsi is more than ten miles through mountain roads from Ting Pu T'ou. In 1932 two leading brothers who helped in the work of a certain denomination there, Chang Ta Ch'a and Lin Jui Chieh, along with three unregenerated members of the denomination, frequently came to Ting Pu T'ou to listen to the Word. The two received the enlightenment from the Lord and were moved and revived by the Holy Spirit and began to understand that in God's work we should not partake of the mistakes of others. They knew it was even more wrong for believers and unbelievers to bear one yoke (that was the condition of their denomination). So they were strengthened by the Lord to leave that denomination. The pastor of the denomination tried to keep them. He did not know that they were leaving for the sake of the truth. His exhortations for them to stay were in vain. The other three members of the denomination were also regenerated and became very zealous. They are also a great help. In 1933 two young brothers (Cheng En Sheng and Teng En Ming) also heard the Word and were saved. They are really precious. In July they rented a house to meet in. After they met for several weeks, I went and stayed there for three weeks. I saw another sister being saved (she is not yet baptized). Now Brothers Chang and Lin can take care of the message for the morning meeting. In the afternoon, they remember the Lord. (There are seven people. Four were baptized last year.) They are very sincere. I am very moved in my heart by them. This work was really initiated by the Father Himself. We can only praise and thank Him!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting at Wu Tai Mountain</H2><P>Wu Tai Mountain is about twenty miles to the south of Ch'iao Tun Men. It is mountainous and has more than twenty small villages. In 1928 a few brothers and two sisters heard the Word in Ch'iao Tun Men and were saved. The most marvelous thing was that one of them was a famous gambler (Brother Lee Kung Lieh). He had some schooling in the past, and after being saved, he became very zealous and obeyed the Lord. In 1930 they rented a house on Wu Tai Mountain for meeting. It has three rooms; one of which is a hut. Now there are about twelve brothers and five sisters who break bread to remember the Lord. They have all been saved over the past five or six years. Two or three brothers are capable of bearing the responsibility for speaking the Word on the Lord's Day morning. Brother Lee Kung Lieh is responsible for the affairs of the meeting. Now their work is very much in one accord. However, their knowledge of the Bible is immature. We should pray for them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Lan Sung Yang</H2><P>Lan Sung Yang is about twenty miles from Wu Tai Mountain. Since 1928 there have been four or five saved brothers meeting there in a small hut. Brothers Su Chieh Min and Lee Yi Lan are the responsible ones. Brother Su was a school teacher; until recently he could not be free for the Lord's work, so he quit his job as a teacher and is wholeheartedly learning to work for the Lord. He also farms a little rice and potatoes to provide for his wife and children. His living is very hard. Brother Lee had a small business before he was saved, but it was entangling him in his work for the Lord. He now farms and works zealously for the Lord to help the meeting there. However, there are no baptized sisters in the meeting. They feel that the building for the table meeting is not so appropriate or good. We should pray for them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Fan Shan</H2><P>Fan Shan is about ten miles from Lan Sung Yang. It is very mountainous. In 1931 some zealous brothers and sisters returned from a conference in Ch'iao Tun Men and were enlightened and strengthened by the Lord to rise up strongly in one accord to leave a certain denomination. At that time they began meeting in Brother Kuo Jih T'ung's living room. Now there are six brothers and three sisters in the table meeting. Brother Chen Shu Yao is responsible for the affairs of the meeting. Sister Chen is very zealous. However, they have many business affairs to distract them. We should pray for them that they can faithfully serve the Lord so that the meeting and work can go on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Five Localities in P'u Men</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Ma Jan</H2><P>In Ma Jan there were three brothers, Fan P'ei Chen, Wen Ching Yi, and Fan Yun Shan, who were zealous seekers of the Lord in the Ma Jan Independent Church. In recent years they were enlightened by the Lord through The Present Testimony to know that in order to faithfully obey God and be in God's work they must depart from error. In August of 1933 there were more than twenty brothers and sisters in one accord. They met in Brother P'ei Chen's house for the table meeting. The number of those who come to listen to the Word has increased over time. If they could rent another quieter house for their meetings, it would be better. I hope the brothers and sisters who are of the same mind will pray for the meeting in Ma Jan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Yun Che</H2><P>Yun Che is about ten miles from Ma Jan and fifteen miles from Fan Shan. It is a remote mountain village with several dozen households. In about 1929, there were five saved brothers and three saved sisters. None of them could read. They met in a grass hut. Now they can read the Bible. On the Lord's Day they meet in the morning to remember the Lord and in the afternoon for the preaching of the Word. They bear this responsibility themselves. Occasionally some workers go to visit them and witness their zealous pursuit. The Lord's grace is really with them. Two brothers, Lin Wei Ch'ing and Hung Ts'ai Min, are responsible for the affairs of the meeting. May the Lord grace them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Lee Chia Ching</H2><P>The brothers meeting in Lee Chia Ching are Lee Kuan Hsin and Lee Hsi T'ui. They used to meet in an Independent Church in P'u City (about five or six miles away). In 1929 they received the Lord's light and leading and realized the importance of leaving man's tradition and obeying the Bible. They were very much moved by the Holy Spirit to have a prayer meeting in Lee Chia Ching. The Lord had prepared the situation for them, and many were saved there. At that time the Lord wanted them to meet in Lee Chia Ching. To their surprise they were placed in charge of a house. Now there are about thirty brothers and sisters breaking bread together. Kuan Hsin and Hsi T'ui are responsible for the affairs of the meeting. May the Lord grace them with His presence that His work may be greatly revived.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Ao Nei</H2><P>The meeting in Ao Nei is ten miles from Lee Chia Ching. There used to be a few brothers under a certain denomination. Brother Su T'i Sheng read The Christian and was enlightened. In his heart there was a battle because he deeply felt that the Holy Spirit could not work with them there because of the many errors in the particular denomination. However, the denomination did not have bad leaders. The brothers who bore the responsibility in the denomination, Lin Li Ming and P'an Tu Ch'i (Brother P'an passed away the year before last), were humble seekers of the truth. In the winter of 1929, these few brothers left the denomination in one accord and then the Holy Spirit moved their hearts to have some prayer meetings in Ao Nei for a few days. The Holy Spirit worked with them, and it seems that many of the sisters and brothers who heard the Word were saved. Now there are more than twenty brothers and sisters who meet together to break bread in remembrance of the Lord in the afternoon. Great opportunity was provided in their morning meeting for the preaching of the Word. Every year there are newly saved ones added to them. Lin Li Ming and Lee Hua Min have their own gifts. In the matter of giving, apart from the expenses of the meeting, they follow the direction of the Holy Spirit and give alms to the poor or meet the needs of the workers. This is a brief description of the work to date. May the Lord bless them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Chen Hsia Kuan</H2><P>Chen Hsia Kuan is a place on the coast. It is about fifteen Chinese miles from Ao Nei. A few brothers used to worship in Ao Nei. In 1931 the brothers built three other buildings here in one accord. Now there are several dozen meeting. They preach the Word in the morning and remember the Lord in the afternoon. Three brothers, Wu Tze Chien, Lee Hsi Ming, and Ling Yu Ju, do business on the one hand and bear responsibility for the meeting on the other. The rest of the brothers and sisters are all obedient to the truth and are in one accord. There is no barrier among them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Locality of Fu Ting</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Condition of the Meeting in Fu Ting</H2><P>Fu Ting belongs to Fukien province. It is about sixty miles from Ch'iao Tun Men. There is a brother, Wu Shou Liang, who used to be in that city's Episcopalian Church. His family had not believed in the Lord. He ran a dye factory. In the winter of 1928, his eldest son Wu Cheng Chung heard the Word in the meeting in P'u Men and was saved. Then he brought a few brothers to his house, and Wu Shou Liang's wife and his aunt were saved. Brother Wu began to pursue the truth with a true heart and understood the error of denominations, so he left the Episcopalian denomination of his own accord and began breaking bread in his home (there were four people). The co-working brothers would go to his home from time to time for meetings to help them. In the past six years they have been attacked from all sides by the devil and have suffered greatly. But the Lord's grace is with them; to this day they still stand. Now new brothers and sisters have joined them to hear the Word in solidarity. The two Wus (father and son) are responsible. (They lack the gift of speaking.) On the Lord's Day there is a morning meeting to preach the Word and a table meeting in the evening. I (Yu T'ing) went to their house twice last year and stayed with them for a total of five weeks, and by the Lord's grace rendered some help to them. I feel they are very isolated and need the constant presence of the Lord's grace so that they may go on. They also need the Lord to add saved ones to their meeting. This is what we ask for. (Unfinished.)</P><P>Your brother in Christ,<br>Wang Yu T'ing<br>January 15, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM WU CH'ANG, HUBEI PROVINCE</H2><P>(This is a letter from Mr. Liu Ai Wu of the Hua Chung Seminary in Wu Ch'ang. We have not seen this brother before, but from his letter, we know something of his heart. We will pray for him.)</P><P>Dear Brother Yueh Ch'iao:</P><P>I received and read your postcard at the end of 1933. I had already thought about writing you and asking you the dates of the next conference, but I was entangled by my flesh and did not get around to it until now. Thank the Lord, He is overcoming! Although Satan's authority is everywhere, the Lord released me through the power of Golgatha! Glory and honor and authority to Him forevermore! Amen.</P><P>Since the Lord's Spirit enlightened me to see the sin of denominations and the corruption of organization, I have felt very hungry and thirsty for the Lord within, but because I am a milk-drinking child, my spiritual life is very weak. I thought that every child who was enlightened by God would have the same experience. I wanted to wait until a so-called "comrade" was raised up for me and then leave the system. To tell the truth, I was afraid of the loneliness of the way of the cross! Did I not know that "constricted is the way..., and few are those who find it"? Unfortunately, I was foolish in spirit and did not obey God earlier!</P><P>During the summer vacation the Lord prepared a way for me to go to Shanghai and called me to go. My spirit wanted to accept the Lord's arrangement, but the flesh was still weak; I actually followed my flesh and went home. The local group of this denomination wanted me to "use a reed for a weapon." I also followed my flesh to go work. In those two months, the suffering of failure was too much for words. May all this shame be upon myself! Thank God, He showed me the result of not obeying! After the summer vacation I still went on in the way of error and went back to Wu Ch'ang as usual. The Lord loves me to the uttermost. Although my flesh is weak, He has continuously enlightened me, disciplined me, and supported me with His power.</P><P>When I saw the news that you were going to have a meeting over winter vacation, my spirit was desperate for this matter! But I did not know to use the cross to deal with my flesh, and Satan still had the opportunity to hinder me! I asked you to send The Present Testimony and Notes on Scriptural Messages to my home in Ch'ang Teh. My wife read them and then sent them on to me. She usually sent them immediately after reading them, but this time, she did not send them until January 2. I did not know that you were meeting on the twenty-first. However, the Holy Spirit gave me special enlightenment; I suddenly felt within that I must decide on the matter of going to Shanghai. On the one hand, school did not let out for vacation until the twenty-fourth. How could I have handled this temptation? It seems that it would have been hard to put it aside! With this one thought, I quenched the leading of the Holy Spirit! On the twenty-fifth, I read a classmate's copy of The Present Testimony. At first I was very happy. Then I saw the dates at the end and was disappointed. I looked at the newspaper for steamer times. There were ships leaving on both the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth. I prayed earnestly before the Lord. On the next day I fasted and prayed, but God did not give me an "answer." I only saw the work of Satan!</P><P>Praise God! Christ always overcomes! Although the enemy hindered my steps, "the Lord made my steps light!" I did not follow my flesh to return home this winter vacation. I did some writing for the school and had an opportunity for quietness so I could review an important lesson He had given me&mdash;The Spiritual Man. It released my spirit and brought me more into the experience of having my flesh dealt with by the cross! I used to demand that God fulfill "my" desire to graduate from the seminary. Now my prayer is, "God, I am willing to obey You and follow Your way of the cross. May Your will be done in me." Since the Lord's word has separated my soul from my spirit, I can only place my soul in a position of death. I only have one more year until I graduate. According to the flesh it is a shame because I will miss success by a very narrow margin. I may even meet with opposition from many people. However, I am willing to follow the Lord's calling and give it up! I ask the Lord that I may be able to boast in His cross! Amen.</P><P>School will be in session in a short time. I am waiting for God's will. If He allows me to go to Shanghai, I will meet all the brothers, and we can remember the Lord together. Please pray earnestly for me, asking the Lord to lead and prepare a way that I would escape the hands of those who do not obey! Is Mr. Nee at home? I hope that he can also read this letter and pray for me!</P><P>Finally, brother, is there anything else I should pay attention to besides what was published in the last issue of The Present Testimony? I hope you can answer my letter immediately! May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you always! Amen.</P><P>Liu Ai Wu<br>February 8, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM TSOU COUNTY,<br>SHANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>Miss Lee:</P><P>Praise the Lord! We are still standing here because of Him and His grace.</P><P>Currently, there are five places where we are working. Two places are in the city; one is the west gate and the other is the prison and guardhouse. There are three places in the country; one is at Tung T'an Tien, the second is at Sha Ho Tou, and the third is at Nan T'un. The brothers and I travel around for our work every week. On Mondays we preach the gospel at the prison and guardhouse. On Fridays we have a Bible study with the believers in prison. On Thursdays we have a prayer meeting at the West Gate. On Tuesdays we meet in Nan T'un and on Wednesdays in Tung T'an Tien. On Saturdays we work in three places in Sha Ho Tou. On the Lord's Day morning we preach the gospel at the West Gate and have the table in the afternoon. There is only one table meeting in Tsou County at present, and the numbers are not great. </P><P>In the Tsou County prison there are already about twenty-five people who have confessed the Lord Jesus as their Savior and have definitely believed in the Lord. We still do not have the assurance that these ones are reliable, but there are a few among them who are quite good. There is a Mr. Wang Ch'uan Ch'in, who was suspected of robbery. He was sentenced to five years in prison. He was interrogated by both the military and civil courts, but he never confessed to the crime. One day he heard the gospel and was the first to stand up and confess that he was a sinner and that the Lord Jesus was the Savior. It appears that this one is especially good.</P><P>Because of the results of our prison work, the guards have allowed us to enter into solitary confinement to preach the gospel to the people there. This has happened only recently. There are usually about seventy people in solitary confinement.</P><P>The work which I spoke of before where we rotate day by day is our usual method. However, it is now the Chinese new year, and the people in the country have more free time, so we stay longer at every place and do a special gospel work in each one. Yesterday, we started in Nan T'un. If the Lord is willing, perhaps (soon) we will start another gospel preaching place in Chia Chuang Ts'un in Shi Nan Hsiang of Tsou County. We work in places where the denominations have not set foot. Our habit of keeping away from the denominations in our work has caused some brothers in the denominations to complain to us, "You are going on another good road, but you do not bring us along this better road." The people who said this were ones we had brought to the Lord in the beginning and then placed in the denominations. (At that time we were also in the denominations.) These ones are still friendly with us. This is why they complain in this warm way.</P><P>The co-working brothers are all well at present. They do not have any great hardships. However, there is a problem in my house that makes it less convenient for me and has made the brothers worry. My wife has been sick for almost fifty days now, and her condition is serious. It still has not begun to improve. It is so serious that my daughter cannot go to school in Yen Chou. I cannot spend the night out and work with the brothers. Please pray for this. I ask that the Lord give you peace.</P><P>In the Lord,<br>Liu Tien Min for the co-working brothers<br>February 17, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM YI LIN, KIANGSU PROVINCE</H2><P>Peace to Brothers Nee and Chang:</P><P>Thank the Lord! He has blessed us with a peaceful meeting and has kept us from being scattered, and we also are grateful for your love and prayers! May the riches of God fill you. Amen.</P><P>In the last Overcomer Conference the enemy did his best work and caused some brothers to suffer. The details are as follows:</P><P>At 9:00 p.m. on the third, twenty brothers from northern Kiangsu went home by two routes. Brother Chiu Jih Chien and seven others took the Ta Ch'in steamer north. I (Wu Wei), my son (named Huei), and Brothers Lan Chih Yi and Hsia Chieh Shan took the evening express to our town. The rest of the brothers, Brother Ma Yun Ho and the other eight took the local. We set out on the same day, but on the way we experienced different things. The express that the brothers and I took was two hours late and arrived in Chen-chiang at 7:00. The small steamer on the river from Chen-chiang had missed a trip and did not leave until a little after 7:00. Thank the Lord! He never fails. The Lord is the Overcomer. When we arrived in Tai Shan, the boat to Yi Lin had stopped running for several days because the river was frozen over, but it began running again on that day. Thank the Lord! "He will prepare." This really confirmed our faith quite a bit! We arrived home safely after five days.</P><P>The most marvelous thing was the train carrying Brother Ma Yun Ho and the other eight brothers went off the track at a cattle crossing. Fortunately, no one was hurt. It took one day to repair the tracks, and on the fifth they arrived at Chen-chiang to take the Ch'ing Chiang steamer to Huai An. When the tracks came to Shao Po, they were attacked by robbers and lost some money. Thank the Lord! Although they were frightened outwardly, their faith was not decreased by it, and they arrived home safely on the sixth. In their letter they said, "The trip home was really full of hardships and a frightening ambush. But thanks be to our Lord, in the middle of the hardships we were full of peace and joy." This really comforted our hearts. The Lord is the overcomer! Brothers Chiu Jih Chien and the seven with him also arrived home safely with only a one-day delay. However, the brothers who left the day before we did, Lee Kuan Hua, Ts'ai Yun Hsien, and Tsou Ts'ai Kao met with difficulties on the Chiang Ch'ing steamer: "Brother Lee Kuan Hua's face was injured and Brothers Ts'ai and Tsou were arrested and taken to Chiang Yin jail for suspicion of crime." The facts of the matter have already been printed in the newspaper. I will explain the details after they return home. May the Lord bless them and allow them to come home peacefully as we did. May they tell a "story of salvation" to give the glory to God that we may know that all things work together for good to those who love God and learn the truth. May the Lord give us revelation so that we will understand God Himself, that our days on the earth can prove His victory and can be spent fighting for Him while awaiting His coming. Amen. This letter is brief, and I am pressed for time. I must say good-by. May the Lord be with you always! Greet all the brothers in Shanghai!</P><P>Your brother,<br>Wu Wei<br>February 11, 1934</P><P>P.S. Brother Hsien Chih also greets you. He also says that he was blessed with God's leading and arrived safely home with no problems on the way. Please do not worry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM TUNG GOU</H2><P>To Messrs. Kuang Jung and Yung Tung:</P><P>After we left you and returned to the East, God kept us safe all the way home. Thank the Lord. On Tuesday we arrived at Yi Lin and on the next day we parted from Chiu Jih Chien and the other brothers and returned to our homes. Please do not worry about us. With regard to the problem on the river steamer, Brother Lee Kuan Hua's face was injured in an explosion. He is now in a hospital in Chiang Yin. There is no danger to his life. Brothers Ts'ai Yun Hsien and Tsou Ts'ai Kao are being kept in the Police Department at Chiang Yin as suspects in the case. We do not have detailed news of them. Transportation to northern Kiangsu is blocked now, so we cannot go to save them. The only thing we can do is pray to the almighty, merciful God. I deeply believe they can be released from this danger. This morning I met Brother Wu Wei on the way to Yi Lin. He has arrived safely home. I also received a letter from Brother Han Chang En and the eight brothers with him that said that their train was derailed at a cattle crossing and their steamer was robbed at Shao Po Lake. Altogether they lost only a few dollars; they are all safe and were only frightened. Through all this we learned a big lesson and praised the Lord's grace unceasingly. This is all of our news. May the eternally living God bless all the brothers and sisters with peace!</P><P>The little ones in the Lord,<br>Hu Hsiao Lan, Cheng Chu Chiu, You Tien<br>February 8, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM CHU CHIA KOU,<br>HUAI AN, KIANGSU PROVINCE</H2><P>To my brother in the Lord, Mr. Kuang Jung:</P><P>I and those traveling with me began our journey home on Wednesday evening when we boarded the train. When we arrived in Ch'ang Chou the next day, the tracks were broken, and we were delayed for six hours. Later we changed trains and arrived at Chen-chiang that evening. The next day we bought steamer tickets for the trip north. The boat went very slowly. We came to Shao Po Lake during the night. Suddenly, more than ten pirates appeared and robbed us at gunpoint. All the passengers on the boat were frightened and did not know what to do. We thanked the Lord that He is the Almighty One and that those who rely on Him will not be put to shame. (The rest of the people were also treated cruelly in addition to being robbed.) We lost very little. Only two brothers, Brother Chou and Brother Chen, lost a few dollars. The rest of us lost nothing. We cannot fail to praise the Lord for this. Now we are safely back in Huai City. I wanted to especially let all the brothers know and ask them to thank the Lord for us and so on. (We counted the time spent. It was three days and three nights.) We thank you for all we received in Shanghai. We greet all the brothers and sisters with this!</P><P>Your little brothers in Christ,<br>Chen Ju Ni, Han Chang En, Kao Shih Yuan, Chou Pu Ch'ien, Ma Yun Ho, Shih Ju Chi, Chang Tien Keng<br>February 7, 1934</P><P>(P.S.

Our boat left at 9:00 a.m. on the morning of the seventh. We arrived at Tsingtao at 1:00 p.m. on the eighth where we met the brothers and sisters from Chefoo. We left the ship to visit two friends. The ship left at 5:00 and arrived in Dairen at 1:00 the afternoon of the ninth. After leaving the boat, we stayed at the government office for three hours. Thank the Lord, we did not have any great trouble. Brother An and the two sisters went north that night. I stayed in Dairen for one more day to visit several brothers. I arrived in P'u Lan Tien today (the eleventh) at 9:00 and saw Brother Chang. He is fine and has received the Lord's blessing, but he is very lonely. There is almost no one in the Lord who can comfort him much. Please remember him often in your prayers. Remember also the brothers and sisters in Ch'ang Ch'un. I will continue north at 11:00 p.m. tonight and will arrive in Feng T'ien at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. I will stay there for one day and will arrive in Ch'ang Ch'un early on the thirteenth. I know that you care and may worry, so I am especially sending this letter to you. I also greet you with peace!

The boat left port at 9:00 p.m. We were protected by our heavenly Father. The winds and waves were calm. The way was safe. I was afraid you would worry about us, so I am writing to let you know that we are safe. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>We had originally decided to return immediately to Tai Sun. However, we were pressed for time, and with the coming of winter, we were afraid there would be many inconveniences along the way. If we were not careful, problems could arise, so we were forced to stay at Lu Pien in Yi Shan, P'ing Yang until after the Chinese New Year. The brothers and sisters who meet in Lu Pien asked us to stay because they hope to have a sisters' meeting in the first month of the Chinese calendar. We are now praying for this matter. Please ask the sisters in Shanghai to pray with us also. We hope this meeting glorifies the Lord's name and causes the Father's eternal plan to be carried out in us. We also hope the enemy suffers loss and that we are built up. This is our news. May the Lord bless you with peace.</P><P>Lin Hsiang and Bao Jen Shen<br>February 9, 1934</P><P>P.S.

Brothers Yuan Chin Chou and Chang Tze Chieh went ashore there. We arrived in Chefoo on the morning of the ninth.

Peace be to you.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Witness Lee<br>February 12, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW TO WRITE A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION</H2><P>(This is a record of a question and answer meeting.)</P><P>Brother Chang Kuang Jung asked: How should letters of recommendation for the traveling brothers be written?</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee answered: Please remember that letters of recommendation were found at the time of the apostles. In 2 Corinthians 3:1, Paul asks, "Do we need...letters of commendation to you or from you?" This is to say that others needed letters of commendation, but Paul himself was well-known, so he did not need them. Therefore, all typical believers needed letters of recommendation. Although there were exceptions (Paul was the exception), others still needed to use them. According to the record, however, Paul also needed someone to introduce him. When Paul first came to the believers, no one believed he was a brother. It was only after Barnabas introduced him that he was received (Acts 9:27). This shows that the early saints did not receive a person unless they were first informed of him and he was first recommended. There is a great need for letters of recommendation today.</P><P>Today if someone comes among us and wants us to receive him, we do not know whether or not he really belongs to the Lord. We have never seen him before, so we certainly do not know whether he is a brother. For example, when a brother from Chefoo comes here, how do we know if he is a brother? The only way to know is if some brothers sign their names on a letter of recommendation, saying, "Brother So-and-so is going to such-and-such a locality, please receive him." If they do not provide such an introduction and if we want to ask him concerning his salvation, he will say, "I break bread in Chefoo. I am a saved person; why do you need to ask me?" Please remember that the only reason for asking is that we do not know whether or not he is a brother. If we receive him loosely, Gentiles and false brothers may easily come in among us. Therefore, letters of recommendation are important.</P><P>There is another reason. Our brothers and sisters should always carry a letter of recommendation with them when they travel because there are many from the denominations (especially in Shanghai) who come to our meetings to hear the Word. In a place as busy as Shanghai, there are many denominations. Therefore, there are always many from the denominations who come to our meetings to listen to the Word. If they go to another place and come to one of our meetings, when they are asked where they meet, they may answer, "I meet on Hardoon Road in Wen-teh Lane, Shanghai." You will think that they must be very clear about the truth because they meet in Shanghai; therefore, they should be able to break bread with you, and you receive them. How are you to know that the person is not a brother in our fellowship? We cannot rely just on what the person says. If a person comes among you in the future, saying that he is from Shanghai, he is not necessarily in our fellowship if he does not have a letter of recommendation. We must be clear about this matter. We hope to settle this matter once and for all in the near future. Every brother or sister who goes to another locality must bring a letter of recommendation so that others can know clearly that he or she is the Lord's.</P><P>The letter of recommendation cannot be signed by just one person. Two or three of the brothers responsible for the meeting have to sign to make it proper, because the testimony of two or three is true.</P><P>Writing a letter of recommendation is not easy because the brothers who go out from us are different. Therefore, at the suggestion of one brother and at the modification of another during our Saturday meeting, we in Shanghai have agreed that there should be three different kinds of letters of recommendation. The three letters of recommendation should be phrased in the following way:</P><P>(1) This is a brother who now meets with us and who is going to your locality. Please receive him because we know that he is a brother in the Lord.</P><P>(2) This is a brother who has left the denominations and is in one accord with us. He walks in the same way. Please receive him.</P><P>The second type of letter is different from the first. The first only says that he is a brother. The second says that he is not only a brother, but also that he has left the denominations. Why is the second letter different? There are reasons for it. The first letter is for those who are from us but who still meet in the denominations. We cannot refuse to introduce them because they are in the denominations. If they are brothers, we must introduce them. However, if they have a letter of recommendation that does not say they have left the denominations, we are afraid that those who meet in all the localities will think that they are clear about the truth and are clear about all the matters such as baptism, denominations, the church, etc. So please pay attention&mdash;from now on read the letters of recommendation from Shanghai carefully. If a letter introduces a person as a brother or a sister and does not say anything more, they are not clear about the truth of the church. If they are already clear about the truth of the church, have already left the denominations, and are already walking on this way together with us, we will say this specifically. In this way, you can be assured that you can avoid many difficulties.</P><P>(3) This is a brother going to your locality. Please receive him. He walks in this way together with us, and he is gifted. He has certain gifts which he can render the brothers.</P><P>We will specifically mention his type of gift so the brothers in other localities can ask him to preach the Word. If he has the gift of evangelism, you can ask him to preach the gospel. If he has the gift of shepherding, you can ask him to speak a word. If he has the gift of teaching, you can ask him to expound the truths in the Bible. If we do not say this, even though you will know that he is a good brother, you will not know whether or not he has the ability to speak the mystery of the truth clearly. It is better to have these things specified in the letter of recommendation than to find it out by asking and testing him. This will save the brothers trouble.</P><P>In my opinion, there is a definite need for these three letters of recommendation today. If we do not have them, there will be many problems. Many people are still in the denominations even though they have been meeting and breaking bread with us for many years. They still are not able to leave the denominations. It is true that they are brothers, but we cannot say that they are clear about the truth. Do you see this brothers and sisters? There must be these three letters of recommendation before many difficulties can be resolved.</P><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: How do we know whether or not a letter of recommendation is genuine? If a brother from Chefoo went to P'ing Yang carrying a letter of recommendation, how would the brothers in P'ing Yang know that it was a genuine letter of recommendation? How can we know whether the letter was written by the locality the person came from?</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee answered: I have personally considered this matter also. According to my personal opinion, we should know the condition of the meetings in each locality and the names of the responsible brothers in each place. In this way, the number of forgeries can be greatly reduced. If a person comes from Chefoo with a letter of recommendation signed by Brother Witness Lee, we do not have to worry at all. This matter can be resolved simply. If his letter is a forgery and he has written several names on it by himself, we should know once we have seen the letter. Actually, all problems can be solved through fellowship, and the genuineness of a person can be proven through correspondence. For example, if a person comes from Fukien with a letter of recommendation asking us to receive him, we cannot refuse him. But after we receive him, we can write a letter to Fukien immediately, saying, "Thank the Lord, Brother So-and-so has arrived at our locality." If his letter is false, the meeting in Fukien will most certainly write a letter to tell us.</P><P>But according to my personal thought, this type of thing will not happen among us. I do not believe people will forge letters of recommendation for the purpose of coming to us. These letters are not checks; they cannot receive any money for them. Nor can they enjoy any special privileges with them.</P><P>However, I think one case is probable. If a brother among us has been excluded from the fellowship (he would certainly be clear about all the matters among us), he might go to Nanking with a false letter of recommendation to meet with the brothers there. But I think this matter can be resolved easily. After you receive a letter of recommendation, send a confirmation to Shanghai. In this way we can be at rest.</P><P>Brother Hu Chi T'ang answered: If you are afraid of forgeries, you can ask the locality sending the letter to write not only a letter for the brother, but also to write and send one to you directly.</P><P>Brother Chang Kuang Jung said: The letters of recommendation should be written by the responsible brothers.</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee said: The letters of recommendation are also written by the elders. They are written by the ones responsible for the church in that locality. If any other brother writes the letter, then the brothers in the other localities will not know how many responsible brothers you have among you. They will not know which brothers are responsible for your affairs.</P><P>Brother Chang Kuang Jung said: I think that the letters of recommendation should be written by the responsible brothers, and we should be able to recognize their handwriting. If it is that person's handwriting, we will know if it is genuine or false. Furthermore, the responsible brothers should not only sign the letters, but they should also affix their personal seal after their signatures; this is the best way.</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee said: You are right. I have thought that if we lack fellowship among ourselves to the extent that we do not recognize the handwriting of the responsible brothers in each locality, we are very short. When that happens, we do not need to wait for false brothers to come in among us; we already are not acting like genuine brothers.</P><P>Brother Shih Chiu Jung asked: Does a brother need to carry a letter of recommendation every time he goes out?</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee answered: I think we should carry letters of recommendation. We cannot say that we do not need a letter of recommendation because we know the people in that locality well. How will the people in that place know whether or not you recently have been excluded from the fellowship? How will they know whether or not you have had some problems? The only way to know is by letters of recommendation. In this way, if we carry letters of introduction each time, we can avoid many problems. Please remember that we should do everything to avoid problems for others.</P><P>For example, Brother Lee has been among us for two or three months. On Tuesday he will return to Chefoo. I should write a letter of recommendation for him to take back to Chefoo telling the brothers in Chefoo that he did not have any problems in Shanghai. If he were really excluded from the fellowship in Shanghai but we did not write a letter to tell the meeting in Chefoo, they would still receive him when he returned to Chefoo. In this way they would overturn his exclusion from fellowship, would they not? Therefore, every time a brother or sister leaves us to return to his original locality, it is best that we write a letter of recommendation.</P><P>Brother Witness Lee asked: If a brother goes out and plans to visit several meetings in one trip, how should we write that letter of recommendation?</P><P>Brother Watchman Nee answered: If we go on a trip to visit several churches but we do not have a specific locality in which we plan to stay for a long while, we do not need to give our letter of recommendation to the brothers of any one locality. We only need to show it to them and then put it back into our own pocket. If there is a brother who wants to visit every locality (there are more than one hundred churches), the letter of recommendation should not be addressed to any one church. For example, he may arrive at a locality on the Lord's Day in time for the meeting. He should go in before the table. But if he does not have time to fellowship with them, he can place his letter of recommendation on the table and sit down, and the matter should be settled. If they believe him, that would be the end of the story. If they do not believe him, they can open the letter and read it. After the meeting, he can still take the letter back. Then he can go to the next locality on the following day. In this way our letters of recommendation are something like a passport issued by the government.</P><P>(This article is the record of a discussion we had after the Third Overcomer Conference.

From that time forward, the brothers and sisters in Shanghai prayed for this conference in the prayer meetings and in their individual prayer. They prayed and petitioned at all times and in many ways for all the various aspects of the preparations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Announcements before the Conference</H2><P>More than a month before the conference, announcements concerning these meetings were mailed out and also printed in Issue No. 32 of The Present Testimony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Registration of the Attendants<br>at the Conference</H2><P>After the announcements were sent out, the brothers and sisters who intended to come to the conference began to send in their registrations from each locality. More than one hundred brothers and more than fifty sisters registered.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Preparations before the Conference</H2><P>As the time for the conference drew near, the brothers in Shanghai discussed these matters in their brothers meeting: how to go to the train station and steamer docks to meet the brothers and sisters arriving from other localities for the conference; how to serve them in the matter of hospitality; and how to keep the order of the conference.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Greeting of those Coming for the Conference</H2><P>All the brothers and sisters coming from other localities, who had written or sent telegrams that they needed to be picked up, were met at the train station or steamer docks by brothers from Shanghai who carried a white flag. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Those Attending the Conference<br>from Other Localities</H2><P>There were over one hundred twenty brothers and over forty sisters attending the conference from other localities. These brothers and sisters came from Kirin, Hopei, Shantung, Anhwei, Honan, Hupei, Kiangsu, Chekiang, Fukien, and Kwantung provinces. Those who came the farthest from the north were from Ch'ang-ch'un in Kirin province. Those who came the farthest from the south were from Tai Shan in Kwantung province.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Condition of the Hospitality</H2><P>Before the conference, we rented a boys' school close to Hardoon Road as a brothers' dormitory. We also borrowed a girls' school close to Hardoon Road as a dormitory for the sisters (the conference was during school vacation). All the brothers and sisters from other localities slept and ate in these two dormitories, with the exception of a few brothers who were physically weak and took hospitality elsewhere.</P><P>(1) Food. The brothers from northern Kiangsu were responsible for this matter. The food they prepared nourished the brothers' and sisters' bodies, and their patient suffering and service edified the brothers' and sisters' hearts and spirits. May the Lord remember and bless them.</P><P>(2) Service. A few responsible brothers and sisters from Shanghai were responsible for this matter. They stayed in the dormitories with the brothers and sisters from other localities. Their humbleness, diligence, and service were an example to the other brothers and sisters. May glory be given to God and blessings to them!</P><P>(3) Prayer. Every morning and evening there was prayer and a meeting in both the brothers' and sisters' dormitories. Our hope was to fill the dormitories with prayer to resist the attacks of the enemy and to bind the activities of the flesh.</P><P>(4) Fellowship. The dormitories truly provided the best opportunity on earth for the brothers to fellowship and communicate with each other. What a rare opportunity it is for all the visiting brothers to live and eat in the same place. When the brothers met each other, there was a spontaneous outflow of love and desire toward one another. Although they spoke with different accents, their speaking was the same. Although their appearance was different, their heart was one; they vied to serve one another, communicated with one another, and spoke with, exhorted, and helped one another. "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is/For brothers to dwell in unity!.../For there Jehovah commanded the blessing:/Life forever" (Psa. 133:1, 3). They did not just have personal fellowship; there was even a free mingling of news between churches and works in the various regions as a result of the brothers' fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Place of the Conference Meetings</H2><P>The place of the conference meetings was still 211-212 Wen-teh Lane, Hardoon Road, Shanghai. Because the building is small, a tent was put up at the front door.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Time of the Conference Meetings</H2><P>The conference began on January 22 and ended on January 31. There were meetings every morning from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and every afternoon from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Environment of the Conference</H2><P>Before the conference, the weather was bad. It was still snowing and raining the day before the conference. But praise the Lord! From the first to the last day of the conference, there was not one day without sunshine. The day after the conference, the sky was overcast, and it began to rain. God really heard our prayer.</P><P>One of the neighbors conducted a funeral before the conference. They beat drums and played flutes, and the neighborhood was very noisy. But praise the Lord, they had the burial service on the Saturday before the Monday on which the conference started. After the funeral rites were over, they were quiet during the ten days of the conference. But strangely, on the day after the conference, they started beating the drums and playing the flutes again.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Condition of the Conference Meetings</H2><P>Every meeting was very crowded. Before and after each meeting the brothers followed the leading of the Holy Spirit to sing hymns and pray. The person delivering the messages was only responsible for speaking the Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Speaker</H2><P>Brother Watchman Nee was responsible for both the morning and afternoon meetings every day. Many people know that he is physically weak; however, he spoke for almost two hours in every meeting. God brought him through. Thank Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Messages</H2><P>The messages spoken on the first two days laid a foundation and prepared the soil. On the morning of the twenty-second, the topic was the pursuit of service to the Lord. In the afternoon, the topic was a hidden life. The topic on the morning of the twenty-third was the requirements for spiritual growth, and the topic in the afternoon was prayer to work together with God. The actual conference messages began on the morning of the twenty-fourth. They were on the centrality of God and God's overcomers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Conclusion</H2><P>The conference ended after the afternoon meeting on January 31. However, there was a meeting at the request of the brothers and sisters on the thirty-first at 7:00 p.m. in the evening to pray and give thanks and testimonies. In this meeting, some of the brothers sang hymns of praise; some offered prayers of thanksgiving for the conference; some presented their difficulties and asked the brothers and sisters to pray for them; some testified of the Lord's dealing with them through this conference and what they had gained.</P><P>A few of the out-of-town brothers and sisters requested that they be allowed to stay in Shanghai for a few days with the co-worker brothers and sisters. The rest began to leave on February 1.</P><P>Thank God for releasing His "present truth" in this conference. Thank Him that there was fellowship among the brothers and sisters. We not only gained His "up-to-date" truth; we also gained the fellowship of the Body. Now we commit His truth and His children into His hands. May He bless His truth and may He bless His children!</P><P>Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM HSING HUA, FUKIEN PROVINCE</H2><P>Peace to Brother Shu:</P><P>I received Collection of Newsletters on the sixth, and I received Notes on Scriptural Messages and The Present Testimony today. There were several brothers who had planned to attend the Overcomer Conference in Shanghai. Unfortunately, the political situation was very tense, and there was no scheduled direct steamer. They could only go through Amoy or Ma Wei. Furthermore, the army was traveling back and forth continually for several days, and many of the cars were sealed. Consequently, we missed this wonderful opportunity. We were unable to overcome these difficulties and be present in person at this gala event to meet and fellowship with all the brothers and sisters in China under one roof, bending our knees in prayer and speaking our hearts together. What can we say to express our disappointment!</P><P>We have wired twenty dollars to help with the expenses of this conference. Ten dollars of that money was the offering collected from the meetings in P'u Ch'eng and Han Chiang, and the rest was from two individual brothers in the above two localities. Please accept it for your use. May the Father greatly bless this conference. May all the brothers and sisters in China be built up and taught by it so that the Lord's Word may spread quickly in these last days. Amen.</P><P>We fully agree with the suggestions in Collection of Newsletters. We hope our brother can spare some time to come to Hsing Hua to lead the meetings. This is what we hope for most. We bless you with health to your spirit, soul, and body.</P><P>We greet you with a kiss from your brothers,<br>Chen Tsai Sheng and Faithful Luk<br>January 10, 1934</P><P>P.S. Please do not forget to greet all the brothers and sisters at the conference for us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM CHU CHIA KOU, <br>HUAI AN, KIANGSU PROVINCE</H2><P>To the much beloved brothers in the Lord, Watchman Nee, Chang Kuang Jung, and Wu Wei:</P><P>When we were in Shanghai we were given the best hospitality in the matters of room and board. We are very thankful for this. Furthermore, we were greatly enlightened in the matters of the truth to understand the centrality of God and the mystery of the overcomers. We truly cannot fail to be thankful for the Lord's grace and the brothers' earnestness. We are very sorry that on the day after the conference, we left at two o'clock in the morning of February 2 and went to the northern station to take the train home, without saying good-by to you. We hope that you can forgive us for this matter. We were both safe on the train and in the boat. We had sufficient money for our traveling expenses. We arrived at Huai An at 6:00 p.m. on the evening of the third and stayed for one night at Mr. Yin's house. We will be home tomorrow before noon. We are sending this letter so you will not worry. We also thank the Lord for being with us on our journey. With no further things in our mind, we ask the Lord to bless you brothers with peace.</P><P>Your brothers,<br>Yen Cheng Piao and Niu Wen Kan<br>P.S. Please greet the brothers and sisters in Shanghai for us, especially Messrs. Chi and the Senior Mr. Wu, Mr. Chiu, Mr. Feng, and Mr. Ting.<br>February 3</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM CHEFOO, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>Mr. Nee:</P><P>(Parts omitted.) We had a ten-day meeting here beginning on February 14 (the first day of the first month of the Chinese calendar) and ending on February 25. We presented the main points of The Centrality of God and The Overcomer of God before the brothers and sisters here. We have also seen the Lord's blessing. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>In the past few days, the responsible brothers and sisters have seen the need to preach the gospel for a few days to the outsiders. Therefore, we will have gospel meetings every day in the afternoon and evening from now until the tenth of the month.</P><P>The Lord willing, after these gospel meetings are over, we will spend another week to speak something concerning the truth of Christ's Body to the brothers and sisters in the evening. All this requires petitions. Please do not forget to pray.</P><P>The brothers here are doing quite well. The things we have passed through have caused them to grow in reality and learn "how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God." Some brothers have really grown. The brothers have already decided to have a brothers' meeting and make a baptismal pool because there are still a few brothers and sisters who want to be baptized.</P><P>Concerning the matter of moving to Shanghai, I felt that the Lord will eventually bring this about. With regard to this matter, I saw the clear light in Acts that there is only one line in the Lord's work. I have already told the responsible brothers here. In the beginning they opposed a little, but now they have taken a turn. I hope I can leave Chefoo for Shanghai before April.</P><P>I have recently received a letter from Brother Yuan Chin Chou. Perhaps this letter could be published as news for Collection of Newsletters. I am enclosing it here as well.</P><P>Has Miss Lee gone to Tsinan? When are you leaving Shanghai? Have you received the manuscripts for The Gospel? Peace be to you.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Witness Lee</P>March 5, 1934<br><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM LING TZU, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>Greetings to the bondslave of God, our Brother Nee and all the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>We thank our God and you brothers and sisters for your prayer for us. During this conference the weather was clear, and there was no hindrance from rainstorms even once. God's grace is sufficient for us that it may be perfected in us without lack (1 Kings 17:14). We can only give glory to God and the Lamb! Amen. We thank and praise God again. He manifested His almighty hand and healed a woman who was dying of tuberculosis. Her father and doctor said that there was no hope, but the ways of God are wonderful! He blesses His own work. Over ten brothers and sisters believed in the Lord and are willing to get baptized from this meeting. May the Triune God give us a good opportunity and an appropriate place.</P><P>We lack the sisters' work here (Nieh Tao Hung of Kuang Jao also feels this lack). May God Himself work and lead His servants to help. We bless you with peace in the Lord! Greet all the brothers and sisters for us!</P><P>Your brothers in the Lord,<br>Chu Le Yuan, Yu Tao Shen, Niu Teh Ch'ing<br>Yuan Hsi Ting, Yuan Hsi Ling, and Yuan Chin Chou</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER TO BROTHER HSIEH TIEN EN</H2><P>(This letter is very long, so we will print it in sections in different issues of this publication.)</P><P>Greetings to the brother in the Lord, Mr. Tien En:</P><P>Mr. Nee has already returned. He has read your two letters carefully, but because the work is busy, he asked me to answer them for him.</P><P>In your first letter you asked the following:</P><P>Question 1: Regarding denominations.</P><P>Answer: The Lord Jesus wanted to lead the Jews and the Gentiles who believed in Him together to become "one flock" (John. 10:3, 16). We have been "called in one Body" (Col. 3:15). "In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit" (1 Cor. 12:13). The Lord's prayer also expressed the desire that all believers "be one" (John 17:20-21). The apostle commanded us to be "diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit" (Eph. 4:3). Therefore, denominations&mdash;divisions like "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ"&mdash;are rebuked by God (1 Cor. 1:12-13) and are the fruit of the flesh (1 Cor. 3:3-4). They are a matter of lusts (Gal. 5:20).</P><P>According to the Bible verses quoted above, denominationalism is contrary to the Bible and is condemned by God. This is very clear. But we should clearly know what a denomination is. We should thoroughly recognize what denominations are and the elements of a denomination. A denomination must have:</P><P>(1) its particular name,</P><P>(2) its particular truth,</P><P>(3) its particular fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Particular Name</H2><P>In the Bible, we do not see churches with a particular name. The Bible uses three kinds of ways to describe whom the churches belong to: (1) "the church of God" (Acts 20:28; 1 Cor. 10:32), "the churches of God" (1 Cor. 11:16), (2) "the churches of Christ" (Rom. 16:16), and (3) "all the churches of the saints" (1 Cor. 14:33).</P><P>These are not the names of the church. They are three ways of describing whom the church belongs to. The church of God means that the church belongs to God. The church of God includes all of God's children. The churches of Christ means the church was purchased by Christ for Himself through the shedding of His blood. The church of Christ includes all those sprinkled by Christ's blood. The churches of the saints means that the church is the union of all the saints. It includes all the saints.</P><P>The Bible also describes the church as being located in one place, like "the church of God which is in Corinth" (1 Cor. 1:2). This means that "the church of God" is "in Corinth." This does not mean that "Corinth" is the name of that church. Therefore, the Bible does not have churches named for a locality.</P><P>With the exception of these four ways to describe whom the church belongs to and what place it is in, the Bible does not mention anywhere that the church has a special name. Today people disobey the Bible, give in to their flesh, and follow man's will to have many names. Some are named for their system, like the Presbyterian Church; some are named for a doctrine, like the Holiness Church or the Methodist Church. Some are named for people, like the Lutheran Church. Some are named for a country, like the Church of England or the Church of Christ in China. Some are named for a ritual, like the Baptist Church. These names are man-made, and they are all divisions. They separate a small portion of God's children under a certain name and set them apart from the rest of God's children. Hence, they are all denominations!</P><P>It is true that the Bible commands us to be baptized by immersion. But using the ritual of baptism as a name to set ourselves apart from all the children of God is not in the Bible. On the contrary, this makes us a denomination which is condemned in the Bible! The Holy Spirit, through the apostle, not only rebuked those who said, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas," but He also rebuked those who said, "I [am] of Christ" (1 Cor. 1:12-13). Using "Christ" to set oneself apart from other children of God is equally condemned. If this is true, how much more should denominating oneself with baptism be condemned! Therefore, if a name can denominate us, that is, set us apart from all the other children of God, it is a denomination. If a name does not include all of God's children, it is a denomination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Particular Truth</H2><P>All denominations not only have a particular name, they also have a particular truth. This does not mean that the truth they espouse, like baptism or justification by faith, is bad. It means that taking a truth as the center of the church, as the center for the believers to be united around and separating themselves from the rest of the children of God is to be a denomination. It is against the Bible!</P><P>The church is built upon "this rock"&mdash;Christ (Matt. 16:18). Christ is the center of the believers' meetings. The believers' fellowship is not around certain truths but in Christ (1 Cor. 1:9) and in the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14). The denominations are established because people made certain truths higher than Christ! Baptism is right. However, putting baptism over Christ makes baptism the center of the believers' meeting; this separates some from the rest of the children of God, and this is a denomination!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Particular Fellowship</H2><P>A denomination must have a particular fellowship. If someone wants to participate in this fellowship, he must join the group first and become a member. The Bible tells us that the believers are the members of the Body of Christ (Eph. 5:30). When we believe, we are already united in Christ. Whoever is a member of the Body of Christ is in the church; they have already been united with the Body of Christ, and they participate in the fellowship of Christ. So we do not have to join the fellowship of the Christians. We can only acknowledge who is in the fellowship and who is not. Whoever has the life of Christ partakes of the fellowship of Christ; therefore, we should receive them. We should receive even those who are weak in faith (Rom. 14:1), "for God has received him" (v. 3). Whoever thinks that being a Christian is not qualification enough for one to be received, and that one must also join a group or be officially recognized as a member is practicing denominationalism. Anything that one can associate with or disassociate from is by definition a denomination! Therefore, a denomination must have:</P><P>(1) a name that does not include all the children of God,</P><P>(2) a particular truth as its center,</P><P>(3) a fellowship which does not include all the children of God.</P><P>If a group has any one of these three things, it is a denomination. The Baptist Church has all three of these, so the Baptist Church surely is a denomination.</P><P>Witness Lee</P><P>(There is still more to this letter, but we will finish publishing it in the next issue.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BRIEF NEWS FROM VARIOUS LOCALITIES<br>(AS OF THE END OF MARCH 1934)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Soochow</H2><P>During February and March, the Lord has used our sisters Tso and Ku to testify for Him in the Gospel Hospital.

Thank the Lord, He has raised up this publication so that all His children can communicate with each other and know the condition of each locality. Through this publication we have learned that there are nineteen localities with meetings in northern Kiangsu. Soochow, Ling Tzu, and other places have meetings now as well. We should praise the Lord! Although the world is full of sin and the church is still desolated, God's faithful children are at the front line of battle fighting with the enemy. This encourages us to continue forward faithfully.</P><P>In Tsinan there has been a meeting in the Lord's name for one year. We will describe how it started and its experience so that all the brothers and sisters in the Lord can give glory to God and pray for us.</P><P>In the fall of 1932, a preacher named Kung Su Teh came to Tsinan to preach the Word. Chi Lu University also invited him to the school to speak. We knew of him before but did not know him, so in prayer we hoped that he would come save many sinners and uplift the cross of Christ to glorify the Lord. Who would have thought that it would be quite the opposite? He did not speak on the Bible. He did not pray. All he preached was socialism. From that time on, we knew that he was not a Christian but a modernist. At the same time, the university made an announcement that all meetings would stop. Of course, that included the meeting in Dr. Stearn's (an American) house. From that time we had eight brothers who clearly saw that our meetings were conducted in man's way and that God was not the Head. Therefore, we were willing to freely come before God to serve Him and receive His discipline. We met in the wilderness or in a graveyard every Lord's Day morning. At that time we did not understand any truth, but our goal was to serve God, so our reading of the Bible, prayer, and hymn-singing were very free in the Spirit. We went on this way for several months. Then the weather became cold and windy, but we could not find a place to get out of the cold and the wind, so we kept meeting in the cold. Finally, it was too cold, and we could no longer stand it; all we could do was consult with the school to see if we could borrow a classroom but not be governed by them. The school agreed to give us a classroom. From this time forward, the number of people in the meeting has sometimes been very large. We also gradually learned a few hymns of praise. The meetings at that time saw the brothers' hearts drawn to God in a very living manner, even though it did not have the manifestation of a praise meeting. Not long afterwards, God showed us the element and center of the meetings through a book on worshipping God. He also showed us the commandment in Luke 22:19. Then we knew that the Lord had commanded us to remember His death and manifest His death through His Supper. In the meetings, we should take Christ as our center. Oh, we thank God for showing us the light of the truth. Therefore, the brothers in one accord began to have the table meeting. We wanted to obey Him so that our consciences could have peace. But we did not know what to do; we knew only that we should obey and practice the Bible. It was a most difficult time for us! We prayed and asked God to show us what we should do to please Him. We also discussed where we should have the meeting&mdash;in the school or outside the school. We bought a cup and a plate so we would be prepared to use them whenever we had the meeting. Every brother in one accord prayed much and waited. Who could have known that before we put anything into practice, oppression would come? We had a brother who loved the Lord very much. He knew what we were going to do, but he disagreed with us very much. He said that if we did this, we would stumble many other brothers. He felt that the gospel meeting in the school would be closed if we did this. When we heard this, it seemed reasonable to us, and our hearts were somewhat persuaded. But in the deepest part of our being we told ourselves that this meeting was "right." We would not stumble brothers by our obedience; we would not cause the gospel meeting to be closed because of our obedience. We went through a long period of prayer and considering, and finally we were not moved. Although we were weak outwardly&mdash;because of the breaking of the emotions&mdash;inwardly there was a kind of strength surrounding us. We prayed again, asking God to show us soon what we should do. We decided not to meet on the school campus but to rent a house that was not connected with the school in any way. We all agreed to wait until there was a suitable place. After a few days, we met again to see whether the brothers had received revelation from God in their prayer. A few brothers said we had to wait for a servant of the Lord to come lead us. We waited because we obeyed each other. In this way we waited for two months, but no servant of the Lord came. Our brothers were impatient with waiting and were ready to break the bread with two or three brothers who did not feel the need to wait. By this time, our Lord saw that we really wanted this, so He made preparations for us. Oh, our Lord cannot be wrong. His provisions are neither fast nor slow. In the beginning of February 1933, if I remember correctly, the Lord's servant, Brother Liu Tien Min, came to Tsinan from Tsou County with a friend who was sick and was going to Chi Lu Hospital. He did not know that there were already brothers in Tsinan who wanted to go the way of obeying the truth. He stayed in Dr. Stearn's house&mdash;they met in the meeting in Taishan&mdash;and by chance he met one of us brothers there. They began speaking of the brother's present spiritual condition. At that time, the brother introduced us to Brother Liu. Our brother spoke with Brother Liu about how to have the table meeting. When Brother Liu heard it, he was surprised and joyful. We invited him to tell us about the truth of the church. He saw that we definitely had this desire, so he spoke a little to us. Because it was not convenient to speak openly in that environment, we found opportunities to visit him and speak with him. At this time, God showed us that the name of the Lord Jesus is above all other names and that we should meet in the Lord's name. Now we could delay no longer. Although many brothers and sisters still were not clear, we believed that the Lord would lead them eventually. At the end of the Chinese year, we rented a five-room house facing north at 50 Hsu's Garden. It was very providential that at that time Sister Peace Wang came to Tsinan to work among the sisters. Many sisters also became clear. The meeting in the Lord's name began in March. Oh, our hearts thanked the Lord so joyfully! Hallelujah! On the first Lord's Day, there were more than twenty brothers and sisters in the table meeting. We sat at this feast, and you do not know how joyful our hearts were. We wanted desperately to empty our thanks and praise into the Lord's bosom. Our marvelous Lord had given Himself and shed His blood for our sins. He had given us His full salvation and had saved us to the highest position. We could not but praise and thank Him. Our faces before this table could not express our livingness, but our deepest parts were joyful to the uttermost while we were eating the precious things given by the Lord and drinking His cup of blessing.</P><P>Since we decided to follow the Lord in this way and go the way of obedience, outward ridicule, criticisms, and misunderstandings have been busily attacking us. But we have put them in the back of our minds, and we put our hope in our victorious Lord who is before us.</P><P>Time has passed very quickly. The school let out for summer vacation and is now back in session. Six or seven brothers who were in one accord with us have left us to go to the places appointed by the Lord for them to work. At that time, the Lord prepared another house for us that is a little quieter and cleaner than the first. From now on the way will be narrower and more difficult. There are many difficulties before us.</P><P>We have been meeting for one year. We praise the Lord for the past. We will still rely on Him for the future. Although many denominations criticize and slander us, we can only plug our ears and ignore them as if we were deaf.</P><P>Last summer we had a baptism meeting. Six brothers and two sisters were baptized. On the first day of this year, seven sisters and four brothers were baptized. One of the brothers was more than sixty years old; one of the sisters was only thirteen. They are all precious in the Lord's eyes.</P><P>We confess that in the past we were disciplined by the Lord in many matters. Satan attacked us in many places. Many things were our own weaknesses. Although we have not done better, the light of the truth is what we want in the end. We ask the Lord to give us more of a heart to obey Him. We are willing to follow the Lord in this way. We know clearly: (1) It is not the glory and profit of the world that draws us; (2) it is not the persecution behind us that forces us to do something; and (3) it is not what our flesh likes. We only know that we should obey the Lord's command. For this reason, we are willing to suffer the sufferings, difficulties, persecutions, tears, slander, and mocking that we meet on this difficult and blood-stained way. May the Lord deliver us from evil that we may be able to obey Him in everything. We know that many difficulties in our meeting need the prayers of the brothers and sisters in all the localities. We ask that the victorious Lord would bind Satan's authority in the air, so he can be cast out of heaven soon. That day is coming soon. What the Lord has promised us and set before us will also become reality soon. May we go on more faithfully, and may we take the Lord's way more watchfully. May the Lord give you peace!</P><P>From,<br>Ch'ien Nung Sheng and Pan Huei Sheng<br>1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A REPORT</H2><P>(This is the record from after a table meeting.)</P><P>Psalm 133:1: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is/For brothers to dwell in unity!"</P><P>Today I see many brothers and sisters here and I feel very joyful. I have been away from you for seven months, but in these seven months, I have never once found a meeting like the one here in Shanghai, so I often have thought how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity. Whenever I was alone in Ch'ang-sha (Hunan province) a thousand miles away and could not be together with you, my heart was grieved. So I often asked the Lord to raise up some brothers and sisters there, so we can meet together. Thank the Lord; He heard my prayer, and the work has begun there. Therefore, I want to tell the brothers and sisters a little bit about how it happened in a general way.</P><P>I have been in Hunan for seven months. I came back this time because I have a month of vacation. When I went to Ch'ang-sha, the brothers put me on a boat, and before they left, we prayed for a short while. One sentence of Brother Chang's prayer helped me the most; I have not forgotten it even now. The sentence was, "God, please go before him and begin the work." This one sentence really moved my heart. Afterward, I also prayed with this sentence, saying, "God, I am a useless person; I can do nothing. You must begin the work there before I can work. O God, if You want me to do something, please begin the work."</P><P>Let me begin by saying something in regard to the work. In the beginning, the assistant director of our hospital, Doctor Ku, was very happy to see me come; he invited me to eat with him many times. One time he invited the members of the Siang Ya Medical School YMCA (among whom there are some Christians). He also invited me to go with him, and we talked about the meetings there. Originally, they had a prayer meeting every Friday, but for some unknown reason it had stopped. At that time, we decided to resume the prayer meeting but changed the time to every Wednesday. The Che Ya YMCA invited me and two other people, Dr. Ke and Dr. Liu, to help with this meeting. They came the first time, but later, perhaps because they were busy or had other frustrations, they did not come often. But among the students there was a great number who wanted the meeting and who had a heart to get some help. So I asked the Lord to begin the work there, and I also preached the gospel to them through this prayer meeting because many of them had not been saved. Because they were unsaved, their prayers were like incantations. I told them that the prayer meeting was on Wednesday, and that we should use more time to pray. But because many were not saved, we could only preach the gospel more before working on prayer. In this way, I preached the gospel first, and in the fourth week some got saved. Later, I felt we should have a counseling meeting, so they would have more opportunity to understand the Lord's Word. So I decided to have two times on the Lord's Day morning, one at 9:00 a.m. and one at 10:00 a.m. for such talks. (They could not all come at the same time.) Although many had questions, the questions were not too difficult. There were just a few, and once they were answered, it was over. Later, I used this time to preach the gospel also.</P><P>At this time two sisters got saved. It happened in this way: After my speaking once, everyone else left, but these two remained. At first I did not know what they were doing. I noticed they were crying and knew they were repenting for their past because they were very zealous before and later they had become cold. I told them that the blood of the Lord Jesus was shed for their sins and that they could be at peace. As long as they believed that the Lord Jesus was their Savior, their sins would be forgiven. Then I comforted them with a few words. After this, they came to the meetings often and were more eager than the others. I met the elder brother of one of these sisters. He was my fellow student at Ya Li University. He said, "My sister is very zealous. She even eats early because your meeting is at seven o'clock." (There is a Bible study on Tuesdays and Thursdays.) I realized that they were very zealous. Sometimes they skipped their meal in order to come to the meetings. At the same time, I saw that their personal lives had changed. From their own mouths, I found out that they were pursuing righteousness. They were dealing with many matters of sin.</P><P>One other person was saved in a very marvelous way. A nursing school invited me to preach the Word. When I went, I met a person on the way, and he asked me where I was going. I said, "I am going to preach the Word. Do you want to go with me?" He said yes and followed me. That day I spoke of salvation by faith. Most marvelously, he was saved at that time. Afterward, he came to speak with me often, and he became very seeking. Furthermore, he has already read The Spiritual Man up to the second volume. When I was meeting in the hospital, he came often, but after the meeting moved to the campus, he did not come. He said it was because it seemed inconvenient to him. But no matter what, he is a saved person. He is a pharmacist in the pharmacy at our hospital.</P><P>There is one other matter which delighted me very much. There was a female student who was about eighteen years old who came to the meeting. She was probably invited by a fellow student. After the meeting she still would not leave. She just stood there as if she wanted to speak with me. Then she told me she wanted to be saved. So I asked her whether or not she had believed. She said that she had believed. I said that if she had believed, she was saved. The next time I ran into her, I asked her whether she was saved. She told me joyfully that she was. Later, she kept coming to the meetings and always brought other students with her to the meetings.</P><P>In spite of all these, there are many things that make me sad! But they are all in the Lord and they are children of God, so we should still love them. Once a pastor came to see me. He did not speak of anything except the question of the church and leaving the denominations. I thought I did not need to speak about this. However, he kept asking and quizzing me, and he exhorted me, saying, "You are very good, but there is one thing that you do that is not good. Because of your meeting, you are taking members of other congregations from them; the number of attendants in the nearby churches has decreased." He also said that I was not very polite to him and was too rude. At that time, I did not debate with him because he was older than I. Later, he introduced me to another old pastor who spoke about the same thing. The other old pastor also exhorted me to stop the meetings because the numbers in their churches had decreased. He also said, "It is not easy for a church to get people to come listen to the Word or to become members and come to their meetings. They had worked very hard for this. Now you have pulled them all away at once." He thought I should not do that. At that time, I could no longer hold my peace. I said a few straight words. I said to him, "Pastor, if all the people in Ch'angsha went to your church meetings, but the Lord did not gain anything, what would you gain? I did not come here to gain anybody. I only have one goal. I want the Lord to gain something, and that is enough. If someone was raised up by God, and every believer in my meeting went to hear him, I would be happy because this is the Lord's work. It is the Lord's gain." He said, "That is reasonable." Oh, it saddens me to see people going after things other than the Lord and uplifting these things rather than the Lord. Their only goal is an increase in attendance. It is indeed sad that they put the Lord aside! As I was speaking, two verses came to me: One was when David was hiding from Absalom, and Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, gained his master's wealth through craftiness. After David returned, Mephibosheth said a word to David, "What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?...Let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house." The other verse is in John 3 when the people said to John the Baptist, "He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him." John said, "He must increase, but I must decrease." I feel that indeed, "No one can come to Me unless it has been given to him from the Father." I told the brothers that if there was only one person here at our meeting, we still had to keep meeting because the Lord said, "Not abandoning our own assembling together." If some brother stopped meeting, we could visit him on the one hand, but on the other, we must remember that whatever is sown will be plucked up, if it is not sown by My Father. Oh, I am nothing; the work is nothing; only the Lord's will is enough.</P><P>There is one other thing. I went to observe the True Jesus Church in Ch'ang-sha to see how they spoke in tongues, rolled on the floor, and shook, etc. But I only saw them speaking in tongues. I did not see anything else. I went on the Lord's Day. (Their real meeting is on Saturday.) That day I met one of their deacons and asked him about the matter of tongues, but his attitude was not very good. Actually, I went with a good attitude. If speaking in tongues was right, I also wanted it. However, on his side, he thought I was trying to give him a hard time. Finally, I asked him, "Is there anyone else here?" He said, "They have all left. The preacher is not here either." So I made an appointment to go the next Saturday. I met the preacher when I went. I asked him about the matters of speaking in tongues and the Holy Spirit. He asked me whether I could speak in tongues. I said I could not. He said, "You have not been saved." I said, "I am saved because I have definitely believed in the Lord Jesus as my Savior." He said, "Even though you believe, you still do not have the indwelling Holy Spirit." I asked him, "Do all believers have to speak in tongues?" He said, "Of course, they should. What is more, they certainly must." At that time I said, "I want to speak in tongues. If it is real, I really want it. But I must first test this Spirit." Then he said that I was not saved because I still could not speak in tongues. I asked him about 1 Corinthians 12:30: "Do all speak in tongues?" He could not explain it and could only interrupt with other words. He related many testimonies to me. I also sat through one of their sermons. This happened before I went to speak with him. The only thing that they kept speaking about was that other churches are not churches, and that they are the only church. They base their assertion on the claim that the other churches are not like those in the age of the apostles. It is a shame! They are a meeting which only uplifts itself. They do not uplift the Lord!</P><P>Ya Li University is very close to us. They also invited me to speak the Word. They had originally wanted the director of our hospital to go, but later they invited me. I thought I should not refuse this invitation. It was very good to have the opportunity to preach the gospel. Unfortunately, I only went twice because they only have it once every two weeks. If the Lord is willing, I think that there must be some who can be saved.</P><P>When I went to Ch'ang-sha, my desire was not that great. I felt that if one person was saved, I had not gone in vain. Thank God, many people have been saved to my surprise. With regard to myself, I have missed so much perfecting and could not hear so many precious words. I could not see so many dear brothers. I am alone there by myself and have not had much growth. I have so many areas that cannot satisfy the Lord. Many times, I know that a certain matter is wrong, but the flesh will not let me go, and I still do it. For example, I bought many things that were not necessary. The strength of the flesh is strongest here. It seems that there is no way to overcome it. Before I did not know, but now I know a little. Once I thought, have I really fallen so low? Do I really love the world like this? The book of 1 John tells the young believers not to love the world and the things in the world. If a person loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. This is not said to the fathers but to the young men. It is something very difficult. Unless the cross operates in us, the strength of the flesh is too great for us. I did not know before, but now I have really seen this. The flesh wants to grab me and drag me to buy things that I do not really need. This is my individual failure. I do not have much more to say. In any case, I must always thank God because He is with me.</P><P>Yu Cheng Hua<br>Winter, 1933, Shanghai</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM IPOH IN SOUTHEAST ASIA</H2><P>To my co-laboring brother in the Lord, Mr. Watchman:</P><P>When you went to Europe and America to give testimony upon the Lord's command, you went through Penang, Malaysia and had your picture taken with Brothers Yang and Cheng. Brother Yang gave me a copy, and it is as if I have seen you, but I would like to meet you personally. I had hoped that on your return journey you would pass through Ipoh, so I could receive your teachings face to face, and they could lead me on my spiritual path! But you changed your mind about your return itinerary. My hope was not fulfilled, and I was very disappointed. My family is from Hsun Wu in Kiangsi province. I was originally a pantheist, then I was an atheist, and I also despised the Lord's way. But the Lord loved me, and I believed in Him and was baptized in June 1914. In the spring of 1915, I studied at Shanghai Yih Tao School but did not graduate. However, the devil was working, and the hornet of heresy arose. I was almost poisoned by modernism, which would have caused me to leave the Lord. Fortunately, the Lord loved me and led me out of danger by leading me to return home and begin working; then I started a school. For more than ten years, I have not had any results, and the future ahead is sometimes clear and sometimes dark. In 1927 the denominational church in this locality was attacked. The Lord then led me south to this place. My dear Lord taught me through the leading of Brothers Kuo, Cheng, and Yang and through reading your books and your testimonies of Bible expositions. The Lord's light led me gradually ahead day by day. I have now been working by relying on the Lord for more than a year now. Thank the Lord's grace! He did not allow me to be a slave in the denominations for my whole life, but caused me to obey the Lord fully and become His slave. My brother, if you think I am teachable, please do not withhold your guidance in the Lord that I may advance. May God be with you that you may lead many sinners to the Lord. Amen. I also greet you with spiritual health.</P><P>The little slave in the Lord,<br>Ku Shang Ch'in<br>February 28, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM LIEN CHIANG, FUKIEN PROVINCE</H2><P>Peace in the Lord to our dear Brother Nee:</P><P>We have not seen each other for many years, and I miss you very much. However, I have received The Present Testimony and the "Gospel Messages," which you sent many times. They make me feel as if I were receiving your personal teachings. I had originally established my hospital in Tung Tai, but because there were many bandits, it was difficult to maintain. I have now moved into the city. I have just arrived in this county; Brother Choo has returned home, and Dr. Ying San has moved to practice medicine in the province capital. So now I am temporarily living in the gospel mission and helping Brother Ping Hsin maintain the affairs of the hall. Although I have now rented a hospital, I still have not moved in! But the churches in Lien Chiang are weak to the uttermost! There are believers from the northwest part of Lien Chiang to Shan-Ts'un, Tung Tai, Hsiao Ao, and P'u Chiang, but unfortunately, most are scattered and backsliding. The reason for this is that there are no appropriate workers here. What is more, through these hard times, the people's hearts are open to the truth, so there is an even greater need for workers to spend their lives for the Lord. Our hearts are aching. We are calling on the Lord and also writing this to fervently ask you to pray for all the weaknesses here in Lien Chiang and to petition the Lord to send workers and to meet every need. A brother like you who loves the Lord could use a special letter of announcement to ask all the brothers and sisters in your locality to pray for Lien Chiang! I greet you with Christian greetings.</P><P>Your weak little brother in the Lord,<br>Lee Yu Fu greets you with a kiss.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM FU CH'ING, FUKIEN PROVINCE</H2><P>Brother Shen:</P><P>I am not in Foochow now. I am a teacher in Fu Ch'ing County, Lung T'ien, Jung Mei School. The locality of Lung T'ien is a small town with many kinds of denominations. It is very confused. There is a Catholic Church, an Anglican Church, an American Church, and the True Jesus Church, etc. The school was established by the American Church. However, among the teachers, staff, and more than one hundred twenty students, less than two or three are regenerated. Although the environment is not too good, I am relying on the Lord's grace and have not backslidden. I really pray that the Lord will give me strength to get through this unbelieving and perverse generation. Sometimes I feel alone, but I receive comfort from the Lord through prayer. Satan often attacks me, especially in my body. But the Lord is the Victor. He can save me when I meet with temptation, so I will not stumble. I hope you also pray for me often. I testify for the Lord to the students whenever I have the opportunity. Four students have said they are willing to receive the Lord, but I still want to see whether or not they really are saved. Let me tell you about them later. May the Lord work to save many sinners here. May the gospel of God be spread so that the people of every place have the opportunity to hear His gospel! I really do not desire to merely teach here (it's a matter of death). I hope the Lord can fulfill a little of His will.</P><P>Recently, the Oxford gospel group came here. They gave four commandments: absolutely love; be honest, clean, and unselfish; confess your sins to one another; and try to touch others this way. I have also been there to speak a few words. They confess their sins, but they do not mention the precious blood, so I boldly told them that confessing with tears is empty. The Lord's blood is the basis for the forgiveness of our sins. However, among them there is also life. Now in Lung T'ien, a separate Oxford fellowship has been set up, with a local person as director. They want me to attend. Can I attend this for the purpose of correcting their mistakes? Or should I not attend? Which is the Lord's will?</P><P>O Lord! Please strengthen your children in these days. Although You are in the heavens, You remember us&mdash;who are in the enemy's workshop (the world). Lord, make us overcomers like You! Lord, come quickly! May the grace of the Lord and His love be with you always!</P><P>Chen Hsi Wen</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM HSIEH TS'UN, WU HSING,<br>CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>Greetings to the brother in the Lord, Mr. Yueh Chiao:</P><P>Thank the Lord. He has blessed Hsieh Ts'un with the raising up of a meeting. We used to attend the Methodist denomination in Chien Li. We believed in the Lord for more than ten years, but we were foolish and ignorant, having never heard the gospel. Then Brother Huang Pao Kuang came to our area to preach the gospel, and Brother Chang Ching Yuan gradually introduced us to what he had read in The Present Testimony and Notes on Scriptural Messages and sometimes exchanged letters with us. It was only through this preaching of the gospel that we came to know the salvation of the cross of Christ and were led by the Holy Spirit to believe in the Lord and receive life. When Brother Huang Pao Kuang, whom we mentioned before, heard the truth about the church, he no longer had the peace to remain in his position, knowing that denominations were heresy (Gal. 5:20). Therefore, he announced that he was leaving the denomination and resigned from his post. The denomination also cut off the preacher's position in this place because of economic difficulties. Brother Huang took the opportunity to resign, but then later the brothers asked him to stay, so he rented a house to live in. He opened a school to teach and continued working for the Lord. All the saved brothers were willing to take the same way together. For this reason, the denominations began to oppose and give Brother Huang a hard time. Our brother saw this, but he knew the denominational error of human organization, so he was not willing to return to meet in the denominations. The denomination called a seasonal conference, and he did not go. They could not do anything about it, so they tried gentler methods to ask our brother to compromise. Our brother steadfastly refused. He still met according to the principle in Matthew 18:20. In the beginning of March of this year, two brothers, Chang Ching Yuan and Shen Hsi Chuan, came to our district to meet and pray in one accord with us. We each told the others how we were saved and the three brothers Chang Ching Yuan, Shen Hsi Chuan, and Huang Pao Kuang were witnesses.</P><P>Thank the Lord, the Holy Spirit worked so that we could be completely open before God without hiding anything. All the saved ones manifested the evidence of salvation in their words and actions. Those who were not saved were also manifested and could not hide. The more we know the Lord, the more we also know the corruption of our own flesh.</P><P>Then Brother Chang Ching Yuan spoke on the two great truths of baptism and breaking the bread. We heard it and received the light from 1 Corinthians 10 and 11 concerning the truth of the discerning of the Lord's Body and fellowship. So we each sent a letter to the denomination withdrawing from it. We also followed the apostles' teaching and fellowshipped, breaking bread and praying together. We have already established the Lord's table. Once the weather is warm, all the brothers will go into the water to be baptized. For this reason, I am sending this letter to you. My desire is that through your publication, Collection of Newsletters, all the brothers in the fellowship around the country will be made aware that the country town of Hsieh Ts'un in Chekiang province has a meeting in the Lord's name and will have fellowship with us. We send our blessings with this. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>The brothers meeting in Hsieh Ts'un,<br>Huang Pao Kuang, Ts'ang Ling Yu,<br>Chang Lung Sheng, and Lu Ying Shih<br>April 20, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM HUA SHE, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>(This letter was written to Mr. Hu Chi T'ang by Mr. Hu Chi Fu.)</P><P>Peace to my fourth younger brother:</P><P>I recently heard Brother Fan Hung mention that Brother Fei is going to gradually bring in the keeping of the Sabbath. He has planned to take steps to speak in each of the four meetings under him, slowly infusing the word Sabbath into everyone. I have recently heard that Brother Fei is closely fellowshipping with Brother Shang. Brother Fei accepted this suggestion because he really admires Brother Shang's knowledge of the Bible. For this reason, any brothers willing to come to the Hua She region to work should be very familiar with the Bible and should be able to completely understand the truths of the Bible. (They should be very familiar with the Sabbath.) This is the only way to bring Brother Fei back from being lost. The most important thing is to pray to the Lord to send His servants to join in the work. The house in Chou Chia Ch'iao changed landlords. The current owner only wants to occupy it himself and will not rent it out. We can only commit the pioneering work of that area into our prayer.</P><P>Your older brother,<br>Fu<br>March 15, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM CH'I HSIEN CH'IAO, P'U TUNG,<br>EAST OF SHANTUNG</H2><P>In 1930 a believer in the Lord from the area of P'u Tung was hired as a preacher in a denomination in Shanghai. In the spring of that year, he received enlightenment from the Lord's truth and felt that denominations were of man's will. He also felt that the Bible was against denominations and that most of the beliefs and systems in the denominations were against biblical principles. Therefore, he felt he must leave the denominations. At the same time, the Lord showed him a vision of the sufferings of the souls of the sinners in his hometown area. The Lord called him to be responsible for the souls of these people. Therefore, he told this situation to the leaders of his denomination and resigned. He wanted to trust in the Lord to do some business and to preach the Word at the same time. However, he did not tell the denomination the details concerning his resignation, so they tried to keep him and promised to help him rent a place and start a mission in Ch'i Hsien Ch'iao in P'u Tung. That place had never had anyone preach the true Word of the gospel before, so there were no churches there. The Lord blessed the work and performed miracles and gave gifts of healing and casting out demons. Many repented and turned to the Lord. Not long afterwards, a "semi-denominational" church was raised up.</P><P>In 1931, the Lord prepared an Overcomer Conference in Shanghai and led the brother who was working in Ch'i Hsien Ch'iao, P'u Tung to go to it. He received the light of the spiritual truth. In January of this year, there was the Third Overcomer Conference in Shanghai, and the Lord led him to the meeting again. During the conference, the leaders of the denomination found out about this. With the speed of lightning, they isolated the brother by political ploys while he was still in the conference. They went down to the brothers in the country to tell them that the brother had received evil teachings in Shanghai. They told them that the brother would preach heresy when he returned. They also told them that if they listened to the brother after he returned from Shanghai, their souls and spirits would perish for eternity. The denomination set up two other meetings near where most of the brothers in that county lived. They also sent gifts of candy to each brother's house and held a feast and invited the brothers to come. They hoped and planned to bring the brothers to meet under their name. However, the brothers who had discernment and were faithful to the Lord did not go to their meetings.</P><P>The number of people in our meeting was originally more than one hundred. More than eighty of these were regenerated by the Holy Spirit. There are now about seventy people who have left the denomination, and they are only meeting in the Lord's name. There are about forty people every Lord's Day for the table meeting.</P><P>The first Lord's Day, after the leaders of the denominations moved the chairs for the meeting out of the hall, the brothers who had left the denomination brought their own chairs from home to the meeting. Now the brothers have already given the money themselves and have had new chairs made especially for the meetings.</P><P>It has been four years since the church in Ch'i Hsien Ch'iao first rented a hall and began preaching the Word. Nine out of ten of the brothers are poor farmers who do not even know how to read the simplest Chinese character. This really fulfills the Lord's word that the good news is preached to the poor. The Lord has truly chosen the foolish and poor of the world that they might gain spiritual wisdom and the riches of faith in Him.</P><P>Going west from P'u Tung is the Whampoa River, and going east is the sea. In this region there are the four counties of Feng Hsien, Nan Huai, Chuan Sha, and Pao Shan. Their population is over ten million. Ch'i Hsien Town is in the middle between P'u Tung and P'u Nan. There is a rich harvest all around and few workers. I asked the brothers in the Lord from all the localities to pray much for us. May the Lord raise up faithful workers to come to all the places in P'u Tung to reap His harvest. I respectfully greet all brothers who meet in the Lord's name with peace and joy in the Lord!</P><P>From,<br>Chu En Sheng<br>March 13, 1934</P><P>(The brother spoken of in this letter is Brother Chu En Sheng&mdash;Editor.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM FOOCHOW, FUKIEN PROVINCE</H2><P>Greetings in grace to my dearly beloved brother</P><P>in the Lord, Brother Nee:</P><P>My trip from Shanghai to this province was safe and peaceful. Brother Shen wrote saying that in Shanghai you began a Bible study on the nineteenth which meets every day. It is a shame that I have missed this good opportunity! Recently I have been asking the Lord to give me an opportunity to have contact with you often, so we can speak our hearts to each other and so I can receive your teaching and messages from the Lord as well as those of all the brothers. When are you going to southern China to visit the brothers? I hope you can let us know. If the Lord is willing, I can go with you. It would be profitable for me. I hope you will remember me often, praying for me and asking God to turn me from my foolishness so that I can testify for the Lord more and glorify His name. I do not forget your work in my prayers, and I pray for you often, asking God to give you physical strength so you can bear the burden God has required you to bear.</P><P>I am one of the last workers raised up by the Lord, and I am advanced in years, so I do not have enough strength. I do not have many days left to serve the Lord! I often regret that I did not turn to the Lord earlier, but I delayed until today to receive a little light and revelation; such revelation has dispersed the clouds and fog so that I can now see the sky. I regret that it is so late! Nevertheless, I should forget the things which are behind and stretch forward to the things which are before. I have set my mind to trust in the Lord.</P><P>Recently a sister has come from Ku T'ien to Foochow and has told me about the desire for the Word in Ku T'ien. I hope that some brothers among us will go there to work. It really is a good opportunity. If you come back to southern Fukien, it would not be bad if we could go to Ku T'ien with Brother Luk and do some work there.</P><P>Since returning to Fukien, I have been caring for the churches in the north of the province because there are seeds sown in many localities. For example, Chien Ou, Ch'ing Liu, Kuei Hua, Yen P'ing, and Yang Kou are places with seeds that have not sprouted yet. I hope you can come home to reap the harvest on the one hand and sow some good seeds on the other. Thank and praise God for what He has prepared. The transportation in the north of Fukien is gradually getting better. We can already get to P'u Cheng from the border of Fukien and Chekiang. The government is preparing to build roads from P'u Cheng to Chien Ning, Yen P'ing, and Foochow this year. We hope to be able to travel through by the end of the year. The major part of the north of Fukien has been pillaged by bandits. Nine out of ten houses are empty. It is really a pitiful situation! The people's hearts are desperate, and there is no place to go. In addition to the cold, they are physically hungry. Their inner hearts have a hunger even more than their outward, physical hunger. If the Lord permits, fifty brothers could be raised up to go from the north of Fukien to the west, the south, and the east, which are the areas most disturbed by the bandits. They could go to save people's souls and preach the precious gospel to them because those who have lost hope in their hearts receive the truth most easily. For this reason, I told the brothers in the prayer meeting to pray specifically for the entire country and for Fukien province and to ask God to send more than five hundred brothers to pioneer in all parts of the country, like Szechuan, Sinkiang, Tsinghai, Ningsia, Yunnan, Tibet, Mongolia, and other areas. Unless they go with God's sending and calling, their going is not only useless but also harmful. I hope you tell all the brothers and sisters at Hardoon Road to pray for this matter. I bless you with this. May you overcome without limitation.</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Chung Ch'un Keng<br>February 27, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM TUNG SUN HO, HUAI AN,<br>KIANGSU PROVINCE</H2><P>Greetings to Mr. Watchman:</P><P>Something happened in the meeting in this place. A brother sold part of his fields for five dollars to an unbeliever to build an idol temple. When he did this, the other brothers and I did not know. We found out after the transaction had occurred. We went to ask him, and he pushed it aside, saying that it was his wife's and his son's idea, but that he did not want to do it. We have already stopped him from partaking of the table. Is this according to the Bible? Is there any other way? I am small and ignorant. I am somewhat lost, and I am afraid of doing the wrong thing in the house of God and shaming the Lord's name. I pray that you would not spare your instruction. I am waiting for your response. Peace.</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>Chia Ying Chung<br>February 25, 1934</P><P>(Answer: This is a sin. However, if he repents, you brothers should forgive him. There is a difference between "worshipping idols" and "being an idol worshipper." Worshipping idols is an action. Being an idol worshipper is a habit. We should cut off those who do it habitually. But we should forgive those who occasionally fall and who repent.&mdash;note from Brother Watchman)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM CHEN CHIA YUEH TZE,<br>NORTHERN KIANGSU</H2><P>Greetings to my dear brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee:</P><P>I received a copy of Collection of Newsletters the day before yesterday and realized the need for mutual fellowship. When I first believed in the Lord, I met in Su Chia Tsui, which is about thirteen miles from here. The second year, Brother Chen Yung Pao believed in the Lord, and we went to the meetings together. In the third year, God worked in my house to save my mother, wife, and third younger brother. God also saved Brother Chen's father and his wife. At the same time, God saved another brother and three other sisters. There were eleven people who went to Su Chia Tsui for the meetings. Before Brother Chen believed in the Lord, he farmed for others and had never been to school. God loved him and chose him. Brother Chen loves God and gave his house to God for meetings in the Lord's name. Messrs. Ting and Chiu were at the first table meeting with eight of us. We thank the Lord that God alone operated to heal sicknesses, cast out demons, and add sinners to the church. He commissioned us with the work of saving people. In three years God has saved more than fifty people. Brothers and sisters in the Lord, please do not forget us in your prayers. May the grace of God be with you in Christ. Peace be to you.</P><P>The littlest one in the Lord,<br>Hsu Chin Yun<br>1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM DAIREN, MANCHURIA</H2><P>(This letter was sent by Mr. Miao Wan Hsiu to Mr. Chiang in Ch'ang-ch'un.)</P><P>Peace in the Lord to Brother Shun Tien:</P><P>Since we parted ways, you have thought of me much. I really am thankful! I have already decided that I have no choice but to go the way of obedience. However, to man's view, it is very, very difficult to go this way! In my home, my wife, who is faithful to the denominations, opposes me. This is merely Satan trying to stop me, and it is nothing major. On the outside, there are those of the denomination who are still coming to move me with love even though they are going on a way which is against the Lord. Sometimes they pray for me; sometimes they say I am very pitiful. Oh, this just shows how confused they are! Furthermore, they have their background. I know that if a person cannot lead others to become closer to God, but instead causes them to go the way of heresy, no matter how lovable he is, no matter how many tears he sheds, he is still the enemy of the Lord.</P><P>Oh, the Lord's will and the emotions of man are before me at the same time. How can I fail to choose the Lord's will and go against Him?</P><P>Thank the Lord who loves us. He has enabled me to tell the denomination that I am resigning from them. They did not agree to my resignation and only allowed me to resign from the post of treasurer and accountant. They said they would still keep my name as one of their members. This does not matter. They can keep whatever they want.

Although I knew that if I did not go in the way of God's will, I could not please Him, I still had not pursued His will. Thank the Lord; He did not put me aside; rather, He bothered me constantly. In the past six months, His light has enlightened me to see the unrighteousness of denominations and that the system of the church I was in has many unscriptural practices. I was bothered even more, and so I left the denomination and came out from among them. But there was a struggle in my heart. If I continue to be a preacher, I am afraid it is not the command of God. If I turn to farming, I am afraid that God will not like it. Furthermore, my family and circumstances have been a big concern to me. I have prayed for this matter for several months, and I do not have any assurance now. I still do not understand God's will. Please instruct me and pray for me so that I can recognize God in everything, and so I can obey Him and please Him. Amen. I am respectfully waiting for your reply. Serenity!</P><P>Lee Keng Tien</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM YI LIN, KIANGSU PROVINCE</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters who pray to the Lord</P><P>with a pure heart:</P><P>The co-workers in northern Kiangsu have decided that we will organize some sisters' work beginning April 4. Miss Chin Hsin Lai will teach the sisters to sing some hymns, learn a few characters, and study the Bible. The work will last for a month, and it will be in Yi Lin. Any sister in fellowship with us in northern Kiangsu who could receive this easy curriculum was invited to the meetings. More than thirty have already registered. We will offer hospitality for most of them. We hope the brothers and sisters praying for us will ask that the Lord's riches fill up every lack. At the end of the sisters' work, we plan to continue with a conference. It will begin on May 7 and will be for the edification of the responsible brothers and sisters in northern Kiangsu and the testimony of oneness among the co-workers. It will last for about ten days and will also be held in Yi Lin. About one hundred brothers and sisters who meet in the Lord's name in northern Kiangsu are expected to attend this conference. We need two things. First, we are asking the Lord to give us a large place for a dormitory, and second, He needs to give us a place to meet. The house in which we meet in Yi Lin can only hold one hundred people. Every Lord's Day, it is so full that some have to sit outside! Now with the addition of those from other localities, we will have no way to seat people! For this reason, we ask the brothers and sisters to pray much to the Lord for an open way so that we can rent a large building and not be hampered by problems in the location. Please also ask the Lord to remove all the frustrations and attacks of the enemy. May the Lord accomplish His will through His promises so that we can give glory to Him for eternity. Amen. May the love of the Lord be with you all.</P><P>The bondslave of Christ,<br>Wu Wei<br>April 5, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER TO BROTHER HSIEH TIEN EN</H2><P>(This is a continuation from Issue No. 4.)</P><P>Question: Regarding the matter of the table meeting.</P><P>Answer: There are two aspects to the matter of the table meeting. On the one hand, we remember the Lord and fellowship with the Lord; on the other hand, the believers have fellowship with one another. The Lord's supper spoken of in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34 is for the remembrance of the Lord and for fellowship with Him. The table spoken of in 1 Corinthians 10:14-22 is for the believers to have fellowship with one another. To partake of the Lord's supper is to remember the Lord; to break the bread is to have fellowship among the brothers and sisters. The table meeting is not only for the remembrance of the Lord (1 Cor. 11:24-25) but also for mutual fellowship (Acts 2:42). Hence, when we have the table meeting, we should pay attention to at least three matters:</P><P>(1) We cannot break bread with unbelievers. Only those who have received the Lord Jesus as their personal Savior and who have believed that the Lord's body was given for them can remember the Lord. This is because the Lord said, "This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me" (Luke 22:19). Whomever the Lord's body was given for can remember the Lord and fellowship with Him. Only those who can say, "He loved me and gave Himself up for me," can remember the Lord and fellowship with Him. Furthermore, the table meeting is the fellowship of the brothers and sisters. Believers and unbelievers cannot have fellowship (2 Cor. 6:14-15). We cannot have fellowship with the so-called modernists. We not only are prohibited from having fellowship with them, but we cannot even greet them. "For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works" (2 John 10-11).</P><P>(2) If a person is a believer, but still has the sins of 1 Corinthians 5:11, we cannot break bread with him. We should not fellowship with him, but also "with such a one [we should] not even...eat." A person does not need to have all six of these sins. If he has only one of them, we may not fellowship with him, because 1 Corinthians 5:11 says "or" and not "and."</P><P>(3) When we go to a place to take the table we should first discern what the objects displayed before us represent. "But let a man prove himself, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body" (1 Cor. 11:28-29). We should discern whether or not what is displayed before us represents "the body." "The body" refers, on the one hand, to the Lord's own body, and on the other hand, to the Body of Christ&mdash;the entire church. We must prove and discern whether the bread before us:</P><P>A.Refers to the Lord's body given for us. We remember the Lord and fellowship with Him through His death which is displayed through the bread and the cup. It is not eating and drinking in an ordinary way.</P><P>B.Refers to the Body of Christ, including all the believers, or whether it refers only to a portion of the believers in a certain denomination. We must see the testimony of the oneness of the Body with all the believers through the bread on the table before us. The breaking of the bread shows us our salvation. The completeness of the bread shows us our oneness (1 Cor. 10:17). We partake of the Lord's table (v. 21). The Lord's table is for the fellowship of all His children. A denominational table is only for the fellowship of those in that denomination. The Lord's table is the testimony of the oneness of the Body of Christ. The table of the denominations is the testimony of division. To partake of the table of "division" is not to partake of "the Lord's supper." It is "not for the better but for the worse" (11:17-20).</P><P>Therefore, we cannot take the table with unbelievers and those believers with the sins of 1 Corinthians 5:11. We may not partake of the tables of denominations either. "Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord" (11:27).</P><P>Question: Regarding the pastoral system.</P><P>Answer: This question involves church organization. From the Bible, we see, on the one hand, that the church is the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15), and on the other hand, that it is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23). It is a household made up of many people, and it is also an organically constituted Body. In the aspect of the house of God, the church is an organization of many people. In the aspect of the Body of Christ, it is an organic entity. Although the house of God includes all of God's children, its chief manifestation is within the boundaries of a locality. Although the Body of Christ is seen in many places, its most important manifestation is the inclusion of all of the children of God. The chief manifestation of the house of God is in the local churches. The chief manifestation of the Body of Christ is in all the believers throughout the ages all over the earth. The house of God is visible, and it refers to the outward appearance of the church. The Body of Christ is spiritual and in life. It is organic and cannot be organized by man. Man can do things in the aspect of the house of God. However, there is no room for man's hand in the aspect of the Body of Christ. He is the absolute Head and Lord.</P><P>Since the church has these two aspects, there are also two aspects to its organization&mdash;offices and gifts. Offices are related to the aspect of the house of God. The house of God directs and guides through the offices. The gifts are related to the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is built up and brought on through the gifts.</P><P>The offices are for managing the affairs in the house of God. There are only two offices: the eldership and the deaconhood. These two offices are only for a local church. There are apostles above these two offices.</P><P>Apostles&mdash;According to the Bible, the first office is the apostleship. Apostles are gifts (Eph. 4:11) as well as an office (Rom. 1:5). This office is not for one local church; it is for the entire church. The apostle establishes elders and deacons in every locality to manage each local church. Each individual local church only has the offices of elders and deacons. There are three offices in the church. They are the apostles, elders, and deacons. The apostles are for the entire church. The elders and deacons are for the individual local churches.</P><P>Elders&mdash;They are appointed by the apostles (Acts 14:23), or they are appointed by others at the apostles' command (1 Tim. 3:1-2; Titus 1:5-6). Timothy and Titus were both directed by the apostle. Timothy himself was also an apostle (see 1 Thes. 1:1; 2:6), so he had the authority to rebuke sinful elders (1 Tim. 5:20, "the ones who sin" refers to the elders in the preceding verse).</P><P>The elders are the overseers. Acts 20:17 says that they are elders, and verse 28 says that they are overseers. Titus 1:5 says they are elders, and verse 7 says they are overseers.</P><P>The elders work together with the apostles (Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22; 16:4; 21:18; 1 Tim. 4:14; compare 2 Tim. 1:6). The apostles are responsible for building up the entire church; the elders are responsible for governing a local church.</P><P>The elders are responsible for doing the following in their localities: (1) governing a local church as an overseer (Acts 20:28; 1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Pet. 5:1-2); the elders are stewards in the house of God (Titus 1:7). Acts 15 refers only to the elders in Jerusalem, not the deacons. This proves that the elders are responsible for governing a local church; (2) administrating finances in a local church (Acts 11:29-30); therefore, an elder must not be "fond of money" (1 Tim. 3:3); (3) anointing and praying for the sick (James 5:14-15).</P><P>The word elders is plural. God never uses just one individual to care for a church. The Bible always says "the elders" (Acts 11:30; 1 Tim. 4:14; Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22; 16:4; 20:17; 21:18; 1 Tim. 5:17; James 5:14); "appoint elders in every city" (Titus 1:5); "appointed elders...in every church" (Acts 14:23); "the overseers" (Phil. 1:1).</P><P>See 1 Timothy 3:1-7 for the qualifications of the elders. The elders must be mature not only physically but also spiritually. They must have families and have never taken a concubine.</P><P>Deacons&mdash;They are chosen in each locality and established by the apostles (Acts 6:3-6; 21:8). It is not enough for the church to choose them; they must also be established by the apostles. The apostles only establish; they do not choose or decide. The local church chooses and decides on the people, and the apostle comes to establish them. However, the elders are not selected by the locality. The apostle or those whom the apostle appoints select and establish the elders.</P><P>The deacons are those in a local church who bear responsibility for practical matters. The elders are responsible for governing a local church; the deacons are responsible for taking care of the practical matters. The elders make decisions and appoint people. The deacons are appointed to do things. The elders manage the money. The deacons dispense the money.</P><P>See 1 Timothy 3:8-13 for the qualifications of a deacon. The deacons must also have families and have never had a concubine. However, the elders are older, and the deacons are younger. There are also many deacons: "the deacons" (Phil. 1:1); "deacons" (1 Tim. 3:8, 12).</P><P>There are also deaconesses (Rom. 16:1). The elders can only be men, but there can be female deacons. Because the man is the head (1 Cor. 11:3), only brothers can be the head to govern the local church as the elders; the sisters may not. However, both brothers and sisters can serve as deacons in the church.</P><P>According to the Bible, a local church only has elders and deacons. It does not have a third office. In the church in Jerusalem, there were only elders (Acts 15:2, 4) and deacons (6:3). In the church in Philippi, there were also only "the overseers" and "the deacons" (Phil. 1:1). The apostle only commanded Timothy to appoint elders and establish deacons (1 Tim. 3:1-13). A pastor governing a local church is something not found in the Bible. The pastorship is only a gift for the building up of the Body of Christ; it is not an office for governing a local church. Therefore, in the Bible, there are the elders of Ephesus (Acts 20:17) and the deaconess of Cenchrea (Rom. 16:1), but in no place is there the pastor of Corinth, Ephesus, Antioch, or of any place. This is because a pastor is not for a local church but for the whole church. The Bible only mentions pastors once in Ephesians 4:11. In the Bible we cannot find a single passage that shows a pastor governing a local church like the pastors do today in the denominations. A local church just has elders and deacons. They are selected and established or ordained by the apostles. Today there are no apostles, so today no one has the authority to establish elders or deacons. However, God can raise up a group of people in His church with qualifications like those in 1 Timothy 3:1-13 who can bear the responsibilities of the elders and the deacons. Although this group of people does not have the title of elder or deacon, they do the work of the elders and the deacons.</P><P>We have briefly covered the offices in church organization. Now let us look at the gifts in church organization. The gifts are for the building up of the Body of Christ. There are a total of five gifts: apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers (Eph. 4:11). (The other gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 are not included with these.) These five gifts&mdash; apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers&mdash;are for the entire church. They are not like the offices which are for the individual local churches. The gifts are given by the resurrected and ascended Christ (Eph. 4:7-11). They are established by God (1 Cor. 12:28). Unlike the offices, they are not established or ordained by men, such as the apostles or their delegates. The ministries are for governing the house of God&mdash;the local church. The gifts are for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;the entire church.</P><P>Apostles&mdash;The apostleship is an office as well as a gift. The apostle is not appointed by man but by God Himself for the establishment of His church. The apostle is not solely for one local church but for the entire church. Peter and John were apostles in Jerusalem. When they went to Samaria, they were still apostles (Acts 8:14-25). They were not only apostles for Jerusalem but also for the churches in Samaria and other localities. It did not matter whether Paul was in Corinth, Ephesus, Colosse, or Thessalonica; he was always an apostle. Paul was an apostle for all the churches, not just for one local church. The apostles are for building up the entire church&mdash;the Body of Christ.</P><P>Prophets&mdash;The prophets are appointed by God to prophesy in His church to strengthen it. A prophet is not just for one locality but for the entire church. Agabus was a prophet in the church in Jerusalem; when he came to Antioch and Caesarea, he was still a prophet (Acts 11:27-28; 21:10). Judas and Silas were both prophets. It did not matter whether they were in Jerusalem or Antioch (15:22, 30, 32). A prophet prophesies in the church to build up the entire church&mdash;the Body of Christ.</P><P>Evangelists&mdash;These are not appointed by man. Furthermore, they are not hired and employed by man, but they are given by Christ to His church. They are established by God Himself, and they are not for a local church but for the entire church. It did not matter whether Philip was in Samaria (8:5) or going down the road to Gaza (v. 26) or in Ceasarea (21:8); he was always an evangelist.</P><P>Shepherds&mdash;Shepherds are not appointed, hired, or employed by man either. They are given by Christ to the church and are established by God Himself. A shepherd is a gift to shepherd the entire church. This is not an office to govern a local church. The shepherds are there to shepherd the entire church; they are not there to govern a local church. Furthermore, shepherds do not govern, baptize, or perform the Lord's supper service for others. The church today desperately needs the gift of the shepherds. We do not oppose the gift of the shepherds. We welcome and desire it. We do not oppose the gift of the shepherds but rather the system of the pastors!</P><P>The gift of the shepherds is given by God to a believer according to His will, so that he can shepherd and build up the churches of God.</P><P>The pastoral system is something set up by men. In this system, men choose men and ordain them as pastors to govern local churches and to replace the believers by carrying out the matters of service to God, such as baptizing people and distributing the Lord's supper, etc.</P><P>There is no place in the Bible that tells us that only a pastor can baptize people. Nor is there any example of a pastor baptizing others! On the contrary, the Bible tells us that the command to baptize others was given to the disciples: "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them... " (Matt. 28:19). The people referred to here are the "disciples" in verse 16. Although these eleven were also apostles, they did not receive the command in their capacity as apostles. They received the command to preach the gospel and baptize others in their qualification as disciples. "Disciples" are not a small, special group of people; "all the nations" could become disciples. The baptizers are "disciples" (v. 16), and those being baptized are "disciples" (v. 19). If the command in Matthew 28:19 had been given only to a group of people with apostolic qualification, those of us without apostolic qualification would not be able to even preach the gospel because the Lord's command to preach the gospel and to baptize others goes together! If a believer cannot baptize someone, he cannot preach the gospel either! However, according to the Lord's command, whoever is qualified to preach the gospel is qualified to baptize others.</P><P>The Bible does not only tell us that the command to baptize others was given to the disciples, it also shows us many examples of the disciples baptizing others. In John 4:2 it says that "His disciples" baptized people. The ones baptizing here were "disciples," not the apostles. When Paul was saved, it was also a "disciple" named Ananias who baptized him (Acts 9:10). Paul lived in Corinth for one year and six months. Many Corinthians believed and were baptized (18:8-11), but Paul only baptized a few of them (1 Cor. 1:14-16). Who baptized the rest of all those Corinthians who believed? It was done by the other disciples!</P><P>The Bible does not tell us that the Lord's supper can only be administered by pastors. The Lord's supper is "the Lord's table" (1 Cor. 10:21). The Lord is the host. We are all invited to the feast to partake of it. Only the Lord is the host, the One who distributes. The Lord said, "Take, eat...drink" (Matt. 26:26-27). The Lord distributes it; we take it and eat and drink. The Lord said, "Do this" (Luke 22:19). The Lord did not commission anyone to administer the table, but He commanded that all should do this. Every brother can get up to start the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup. There is no chairperson&mdash;like the pastors today&mdash;who should administer the bread and the cup. This is because the Lord Himself is among us as the host, distributing the bread and the cup to us. The Lord promised us, "For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst" (Matt. 18:20). Furthermore, in the table meeting, we each fellowship with the Lord directly to remember Him; we do not need someone to stand between us and the Lord as a mediator. Today we are all priests (1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6). We can all enter boldly into the Holy of Holies to worship God (Heb. 4:16; 10:19). Therefore, when we worship God today, there should not be someone like a priest to replace us. That is Judaism, and it is the tradition of Roman Catholicism! We may not and should not give up our right to worship God to someone else, nor should we hire someone to do it for us just as we commit or hire others to take care of our worldly affairs. Furthermore, when we come before God, we cannot have a hierarchy, because we are all the children of God and brothers one of another (Matt. 23:8). Therefore, having a pastor to take over or replace others in the matters of baptizing people and the Lord's supper is absolutely against the Bible!</P><P>Teachers&mdash;Teachers are appointed by God Himself and are also for the entire church. It did not matter whether Apollos was in Ephesus or in Corinth; he was always a teacher (Acts 18:24-28; 1 Cor. 3:6). The teachers teach the entire church.</P><P>Among these five gifts, there are two, apostles and prophets, that we do not see today in the church. Today in the church, we only see evangelists, shepherds, and teachers. An evangelist is like a father begetting a son (1 Cor. 4:15). A shepherd is like a nursing mother feeding her children, and a teacher is like a tutor. The evangelists bring people into the church. The shepherds feed them and make them grow. The teachers then teach them and make them into useful material. Thus, these gifts are appointed by God Himself, "for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ" (Eph. 4:12).</P><P>Question: What should we do after leaving the denominations?</P><P>Answer: The Bible says that after we have left these things, we should "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart" (2 Tim. 2:20-22). The Lord can and wants to give us those who want to pursue Him. Before the Lord gives them to us, on the one hand, we should ask the Lord for them, and on the other hand, we should wait. Actually, going back to the denominations to listen to the sermon is not that profitable. If you have time, it would be better to follow the leading of the Lord to go out and preach the gospel and bring sinners to the Lord. When you have sinners that have come to the Lord, you can have the table meeting together. You do not have to wait for many. As long as there are "two or three," it is enough (Matt. 18:20).</P><P>After leaving the denominations, we should treat the brothers and sisters in them with meekness and love. We leave the sinful sects, not the brothers in the Lord or the children of God. We leave the denominations, not the church. We may not leave the church, nor can we ever leave it. It is not that we separate ourselves from the children of God. We cannot be together with them in the sinful sects. We separate from them because they are in the sinful sects, and the sin of the sects separates them from us. Therefore, we should have a loving motive and a meek attitude toward any brother or sister in the denominations. May our feet stand firmly on the truth. May our hearts be solid and humble in the Lord. May our attitude be meek in love. May our words be seasoned with salt and always cordial (Col. 4:6). May God give us "the wisdom from above [which] is first pure, then peaceable, forbearing, compliant, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, without hypocrisy" (James 3:17).</P><P>Question: Should the meeting place have a name?</P><P>Answer: No, it should not. Please read the preceding answer to the question concerning sects, especially the part about having names. The building which we use for meetings does not need a name to differentiate itself, because the church of God is God's children, not the house they use to meet in. The building that is used for meetings is not the temple of God. We are the temple of God. God does not dwell in the building we meet in. He dwells in us (1 Cor. 3:16-17; 2 Cor. 6:16; Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Pet. 2:5).</P><P>Finally, dear brother! We do not talk about these matters because we naturally like to be critical of others, repudiate the errors of others, or be contentious about words. Moreover, we do not leave the denominations because we are proud and arrogant in our natural selves, wanting to be leaders and not willing to be restricted by others; nor is it because we are naturally stubborn and like to be individuals away from the crowd. The reason we speak about the error of denominations and leave them is because denominations are condemned by God; they are the fruit of the flesh, and they are of the old man. We leave the denominations because the flesh and the old man have already been crucified on the cross (Gal. 5:24; Rom. 6:6), because God wants us to put off the old man (Eph. 4:22), and because we want to please God, to deal with the flesh, and put off the old man. If we leave the denominations because we have argued with someone, or if we only leave the denominations and do not deal with the flesh or put off the old man, it is worthless before God! If we leave the denominations because we want to put on the new man, deal with the flesh, and put off the old man to pursue the riches of spiritual life and to manifest the Body of Christ, then that is very precious before God! May God bless us. I bless you with peace!</P><P>Your brother in Christ,<br>Witness Lee for Watchman Nee<br>February 4, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BRIEF NEWS FROM VARIOUS LOCALITIES<br>(END OF APRIL 1934)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Nan Shu Chou</H2><P>Our sister Miao Yun Chun met with the sisters in Nan Shu Chou for twenty days last month and the beginning of this month.

Therefore, we moved our meeting into the T'ien Mei Chapel on December 17 of last year. Unfortunately, many milk-taking believers and worldly members of the Chapel do not understand that our meeting is in the Lord's name. They have risen up as a group to taunt us that we are the Baptist denomination and are established by man's will. Our meeting is not a denomination according to man's will, nor is it established by man according to man's methods. It has been more than a year since I received the Holy Spirit's leading to leave the denominations and to meet in the Lord's name. It really is the Lord's grace to be called out to be separated from the denominations and to meet in the Lord's name (Matt. 18:20). Man does not appoint us; our Head, the Lord Jesus, appoints us. We follow the Father's will and meet in accordance with the command of the Lord Jesus. We listen to the Lord's commandment and not man's commandment. At any rate, we only rely on the Lord. We only follow the Lord's commandment. We only meet in the Lord's name, so we do what God's unique universal church should do. Any Christian who can take solid food must take this way. The Lord's Day is the day to worship God, break the bread, and drink the cup in remembrance of the Lord (1 Cor. 11:23-31; Heb. 5:12-13). Please pray for us often in the Lord's love. May the grace and peace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all until eternity.</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>Yun Feng Chan<br>1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM CHEN CHIA YUEH TZE,<br>NORTHERN KIANGSU</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>We thank and praise the Lord because day by day He leads us on in our pilgrimage in this world. Although we meet with many problems, He always opens a way for us. Although Satan attacks in many ways, we are able to stand firm by relying on our overcoming Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning of the Table Meeting in His Name</H2><P>The meeting here began in 1929. At that time, there were seven or eight brothers and sisters in the table meeting. Later, the Lord Himself added saved ones to the meeting. Day by day we added quite a few new brothers and sisters. By 1933 there were more than ninety brothers and sisters in the table meeting. Among them were the brothers and sisters from Pan Hu. It was inconvenient for them to come for the meetings because the distance was so great, so this year they began having the table meeting in Pan Hu. (It is about fifteen or sixteen miles to the northeast of Chen Chia Yueh Tze.) According to outward circumstances, it was right for them to have a meeting there. Thank the Lord, the condition of the meeting there is very good now. This year (1934) the number of brothers and sisters is still increasing steadily. There are more than sixty brothers and sisters who come every Lord's Day to meet for the breaking of the bread. We see the Lord Himself working, and we cannot but testify for Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Recent Persecution</H2><P>There is a town near here called Tun Shan Ma. It is about thirteen or fourteen miles away. There are more than twenty brothers and sisters there. The people there are very wild. Their knowledge and mentality are very crude. When they hear that someone has believed in the Lord and does not burn paper money or incense and does not do other types of superstitious things, they are very surprised. Furthermore, the believers do not associate much with the unbelievers, so the believers' relatives and neighbors are not happy and have become antagonistic toward them. They see the believers meeting morning and evening, and they are jealous. They often exhibit an opposing attitude. In the first month of this spring, I (Chen Yung K'uan) and Brother Chi Yung Tung went there to visit the brothers. We met in a brother's house in the evening. Brother Chi had prepared a small message for that time. We had just started when suddenly many people who looked very wild and mean showed up outside. One person came inside and grabbed Brother Ma Shang Feng's Bible out of his hand; then many people began shouting, "Beat him, beat him; drag Ma Shang Feng out and beat him." (These people were Brother Shang Feng's family.) Then they took Brother Chi's book bag, the hymns which were hanging on the walls, and a few hymnals, etc., and burned them. At that time some Gentiles who were listening to the Word were stirred up. They did not agree with this disturbance, and they began to fight with the opposers. Brother Chi and I could only bow our heads and pray as we saw this situation. We gave ourselves to the Lord and quietly exhorted the nearby brothers and sisters to endure by relying on the Lord and to not be provoked. At that time there were more than twenty brothers and sisters in the room. With the exception of a few new believers who were weaker and got excited, the rest were very quiet and did not say anything. They waited to see what God would have them to do. The mob wanted to set fire to the house we were meeting in. Later they were stopped by the elders of the town and eventually did nothing. They rioted for two hours before they began to disperse. Then we were taken home by Brother Yao to rest. One person was injured (one of the opposers) that evening. The injured man said that we hit him, and he wanted to force Brother Ma Shang Feng to pay his medical expenses and give him a gift of reparation. If Brother Ma did not, he was going to take our brother to the county seat and sue him. The next day, after the townspeople helped settle the case, our brother promised to pay him according to the teaching in Matthew 5:39-42, and finally the injured opposer stopped threatening. However, since this episode, the unbelievers in the town still slander the Lord's name and shame and oppose our brothers and sisters. They want to stop them from meeting. On February 7, we had an edification meeting for the believers. Brother Chiu Jih Chien was responsible. There was a Sister Ma there (Shang Feng's cousin) who brought a Sister T'ang to the meeting. (This sister is already married. Her husband's last name is Chen. Now she is staying in her mother's house and is a neighbor of Sister Ma.) They had traveled half-way to the meeting when Sister T'ang's older brother was asked about this matter by his sister's mother-in-law. He brought a stick and pursued them. He began beating his sister with the stick. Sister Ma was standing beside them and said a few words of exhortation to the brother. She was also beaten two times. Sister Ma was very good. She knew how to endure for the Lord and still came to the meeting. Poor Sister T'ang was taken home by her brother and sent to her husband's house. Furthermore, her brother and parents-in-law decided to stop her from meeting. The road from Tun Shan Ma to Chen Chia Yueh Tze goes through a town that our brothers and sisters must pass through on their way to the meetings. When the people of that town see the brothers and sisters coming to the meeting, they slander them with all kinds of words. Furthermore, they sometimes push the sisters into the river. Oh, we really see Satan's special work in attacking our brothers and sisters. But we also see the Lord's victory in protecting them in all these situations and manifesting His strength and blessing. Although a sudden storm has arisen on the sea, we thank the almighty Lord. He can calm the wind and the waves (Matt. 8:23-27). Now the persecution and opposition have temporarily stopped. Although the brothers and sisters have passed through many storms, they have learned much. Their faith has not been weakened; on the contrary, their strength and boldness have been manifested. (Since passing through persecution, they have not only continued meeting but also are more diligent to come.) Their hymn is, "I praise You for what went before. I trust in You for what is to come." May the brothers and sisters who love the Lord faithfully remember to pray before God for the church in Chen Chia Yueh Tze and the brothers and sisters in Tun Shan Ma, asking the Lord to protect us until He comes. Amen! Peace in the Lord.</P><P>Your small brothers in the Lord,<br>Chen Yung K'uan and Hsu Chin Yun<br>April 23, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COLLECTION OF NEWS FROM<br>P'ING YANG, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>Many brothers and sisters who have fellowship with us have wanted to know about the condition of all the meetings in P'ing Yang, but they have not been able to know the details. For the sake of fellowship in the Body, I must tell something of their condition so that all the brothers and sisters who love the Lord can know how the Lord raised up His work in P'ing Yang and can give thanks and praise to the only blessed God and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</P><P>Praise and thank the Lord, in these past few years He has shined upon His desolated sanctuary with the light of His face so that we, the remnant who have escaped, could be raised up. It is difficult to describe all the details of what happened. I will go back to the beginning. In February of 1928 there were three brothers from Tai Sun in P'ing Yang who went to Shanghai for the first conference. After the conference, they came back with the light of the truth. At that time, a few brothers in Ch'iao Tun Men were enlightened and obeyed the truth. This was the beginning of the work in P'ing Yang. After this the fountain of the truth slowly flowed to Nan Kang, P'u Men, Chiang Nan, and Hsiao Nan. Now there are twenty-two places with meetings in the Lord's name. There are twelve places in the regions of Nan Kang, P'u Men, and Fu Ting (Tung Shan), which Brother Wang Yu T'ing already published a letter about, so I will not repeat him. Now I will only tell the brothers and sisters something about the beginning and condition of the other ten localities.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning and Condition<br>of the Meeting in Ya Yao Tou</H2><P>There was an Independent Church in this place originally. In 1929 Brother Hsieh Lien San of this locality went to P'u Men to do business as a coolie. He heard the truth there and was enlightened. When he returned, he testified to the truth among the brothers. Before long many brothers rose up to pursue the truth. Later, brothers came from Nan Kang and P'u Men to do some perfecting work here. They also mentioned something about the matter of the church. The eyes of the brothers were enlightened more, and they left their denomination and began meeting completely under the Lord's name. Although there was a small number of brothers who opposed, it was not long before they all obeyed. Now there are more than thirty brothers and sisters in the table meeting. There are about one hundred fifty who come to listen to the Word but do not break bread yet. Brothers Hsieh Lien San and Kung Yung Ching are responsible here. They both have busy occupations, and they also do a holy work for the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning and Condition<br>of the Meeting in Chia Ti</H2><P>This meeting came out of the China Inland Mission. About two miles from the meeting place, there is a church of the China Inland Mission. Brother Tai Yun Chang used to work in the mission. He obeyed the truth very much and knew that there were many methods used in the denominations which were not according to the Bible but were the organization of man's will and should be cut out. Unfortunately, he did not clearly see what characteristics the church of God should have, so he intended to reform from within and did not come out then. He went this way for many years, but the result was some outward improvement without the revival of spiritual life.</P><P>In the spring of 1931, Brother Tai decided to move to K'an Men, but there was nobody to take over the work. He invited me (Brother Chen Ching Fa) to take over. I worked there for one year. The result was like the hand of Uzziah when he reached out to steady the ark as it was about to fall. I felt spiritually dead inside. Every Lord's Day meeting felt like a thousand-pound weight upon me which I could not move. For this reason, in the spring of 1932, I was led by the Lord to come out from among them with a few brothers and sisters. We met in Brother Cheng Chih Ming's house in Chia Ti. Although this was in a small alley, the brothers and sisters felt very happy in their hearts. They met like this for a year, and then the meeting place became too small. Brother Lin Tze Chung built a small building with his own savings which he saved on clothing and food. After the new building was completed in the spring of 1933, he moved me and my family into the new building. At the same time, the meeting also moved into the new building. Thank the Lord, although the new building is small, it is very useful. The brothers also have given money willingly to furnish the utensils, tables, and benches, etc., for the meeting. Now there are only ten brothers and sisters at the table meeting. There are also more than ten who come to hear the Word but still do not take the table. Brother Lin is responsible here. If I do not go out, I also help the brothers here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning of the Meeting in Fang Yen Hsia</H2><P>This meeting turned from an Independent Church to meet in the Lord's name. In the summer of 1932, there was a conference here. The person who spoke at that conference did not mention the matter of the church. He only spoke on a few matters concerning the building up of the spiritual life. But when the brothers received the light of the truth, they themselves saw that many things in the organization of the denominations were not according to the Bible. They began to leave the denominations, drop the names of the meetings, then began practicing baptism and breaking bread, etc. Now there are more than thirty brothers and sisters who break bread together on the Lord's Day. There are between seventy and eighty who come to listen to the Word but still do not participate in the table meeting. Brother Lin Tze Hua has been bearing the responsibility recently.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Experience of the Meeting<br>in Lu Pien from Its Beginning</H2><P>This meeting began in the winter of 1932. But before it started, it went through two years of struggle because the brothers were in the China Inland Mission. This particular group of the China Inland Mission was in Yi Shan Town about three miles from Lu Pien. There were many people in that group, but there was no godliness in their worship. In their meetings they crowded into the hall, talking and clattering continuously. Then Brother Huang Lu Ch'uan came to work. On the one hand, he spoke concerning the matter of the church and pointed out the error of the denominations; on the other hand, he organized the content and dignified the worship. He had not done this work for very long when half of the brothers and sisters obeyed the truth and were willing to leave the error of the denominations to meet according to the principles of 1 Corinthians 14. But the other half of the brothers and sisters did not understand at all. Some rejected the truth because they despised others. Some were unwilling to obey because they wanted to keep their position. Some were unwilling to drop their own will, so they created much criticism. There were many other complicated reasons that are difficult to explain. In this way, the spirits of the brothers and sisters were almost entirely surrounded by an atmosphere of debate. At this time, the brothers and sisters who loved the Lord felt that it was a great suffering. If they did not go  to worship, they were not peaceful in their hearts. If they went to worship, it was not real worship. Furthermore, they had to listen to and be filled up with the words of the debates, which was a very tasteless experience. But the brothers in one accord had a mistaken concept at the time. They thought that the entire congregation had to change before they could be at peace. They thought that if they left, others would say that they were dividing the Body of Christ. It seemed that they were caught in a dilemma. They were in this kind of situation for a little more than two years. Later, because the brothers in Chia Ti had already left the denominations, some of the brothers from Yi Shan Town went to Chia Ti for the table meetings, and they were very happy. They learned that new wine could not be put into old wineskins. They must leave to resolve the dilemma. The brothers went in one accord to find an appropriate building and buy equipment. In Lu Pien they got two small buildings and began to meet according to the principles in the Bible. There is a table meeting every Lord's Day morning. In the afternoon, there is a meeting for preaching the Word and building up (sometimes it is also a gospel meeting). It has been more than a year since the beginning of this kind of meeting. In this year the Lord has really blessed the church and has gradually added saved ones to them. Now there are more than thirty brothers and sisters who break bread together. There are seventy who come to listen to the Word but do not break bread yet. There are more than twenty newly saved ones. Brothers Huang Lu Ch'uan, Huang Ting Yi, Lin Pu Chin, and Hsueh Chung Chu all bear the responsibility for the work and affairs of the meeting.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning and Recent Condition<br>of the Meeting in Hsiao Chia Tu</H2><P>The meeting here was part of an Independent Church. In April 1931, the responsible brother of this locality went to a conference in Chin Hsiang, where he received the enlightenment of the truth. When he returned, he knew that to work as he had before was worthless. At the time, he knew he must have a new start. He gained the consent of the brothers in the locality, and they left the denominations and began meeting in the Lord's name in their original meeting hall. There are about thirty brothers and sisters breaking bread every Lord's Day. There are also more than ten men and women who come to listen to the Word but do not break bread yet. Three of these have already been saved and are waiting to be baptized. One aspect of the Lord's grace is particularly manifested among them: the brothers' hearts are able to be one in obeying the Lord's truth. However, their spiritual life has not grown very much (because they have not been very diligent in the matters of reading the Bible and prayer), and they lack the gift of prophesying. In these past years, there has been only one brother with the gift, aside from the responsible brother, Yang Li Jen. He is a tailor, Brother Chen Ts'ung Yi. When Brother Yang goes on a trip, Brother Chen helps the meeting to speak some truths. Because this brother is limited by his craft, his heart is divided to the extent that he cannot serve the brothers with his whole strength; the strength of his testimony is also weakened by this. I ask the brothers and sisters who love the Lord to pray for the brothers and sisters in Hsiao Chia Tu so that the Lord would raise up the gift of prophesying and give them life that they could grow quickly. Pray that they will read the Bible and pray more in order that they can contact the Lord and glory can be given to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning and Condition<br>of the Meeting in Hu Shan</H2><P>This meeting was an Independent Church. Then some brothers read many of the publications put out by the Gospel Book Room, and they received much light. They also heard many truths in the conferences in all the localities. In the fall of 1931 they invited Brother Wang Yu T'ing to come to their locality for a week of conference. From that time onward, the brothers had more and more light of the truth. After that meeting, seven brothers rose up to be baptized (they had already been sprinkled) and at the same time began meeting to break bread as the Bible commands. (At first, they broke bread once a month. Probably the denominations here in P'ing Yang do the same.) They had not been practicing this for long when a group of brothers and sisters who really love the Lord tasted some of the flavor of the joy from heaven. But the members who had not been regenerated or who were nominal Christians felt that this type of meeting was too dry and tasteless, so some gradually left. The number in the meetings gradually decreased. For this reason, some of the outsiders criticized them, saying, "The church in Hu Shan does not have anyone coming to worship, because they left the denominations. They will close their doors soon." Praise and thank the Lord; this word will never become reality, because the Lord said, "I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut." The Lord has gradually added saved ones to them since last year. Every Lord's Day people spontaneously come to hear the gospel. Now there are thirty-six brothers and sisters who break bread together. There are between fifty and sixty people who come to listen to the Word but do not break bread yet. Every Lord's Day morning they have the table and they also have another meeting for preaching the gospel. In the afternoon there is a meeting for building up. There are several people who bear the responsibility for the meetings and its affairs. They are Chou Ta Ch'in, Lin Ch'u Ch'ien, P'an Fu Ch'ing, and some others. Apart from these, there are also a few brothers who stand up in the Lord's Day meetings to testify to the truth. Please pray for those who come to hear the gospel that they will be saved soon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning and Condition<br>of the Meeting in Feng Ch'uan</H2><P>It is hard to say definitely when this meeting began. The work began three years ago. The Lord's table was established after the fall of last year. In the two or three years preceding the establishment of the table, they received the truths about the spiritual life, but they were afraid of the matter of the church. They thought that the many things in the denominations which are against the Bible should be improved, but that completely leaving the denominations might also be an error. So a few brothers rose up to do a repair work. On the one hand, they eliminated the things that were flagrantly against the Bible, and on the other hand, they paid much attention to salvation every Lord's Day. Therefore, the brothers and sisters already understood something about all the matters of salvation. However, they knew nothing about the matter of the church. Thank the Lord, those responsible brothers received the light about the church last year. They know not only that in the denominations there are a few problems that are against the Bible but also that the whole system of the denominations is basically against the Bible. Therefore, in November of last year, they established the Lord's table according to the Bible. They break bread to remember the Lord every Lord's Day. They have completely broken their relationship with the denomination that they belonged to originally. Unfortunately, there are a few brothers and sisters who are not completely in one accord. There are still a few who do not attend the table meeting. (They feel it is too solemn and terrible.) May the brothers and sisters who love the Lord pray much for this meeting. May the Lord enable them all to speak the same thing so that Satan will have no ground. There are more than fifty people who meet to break bread. There are more than one hundred who come to listen to the Word but still do not break bread. There are three brothers, Hsu Jung San, Hsu Chih Yi, and Hsu Wei San, who bear the responsibility for the work of the meeting and its affairs.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Condition of the Meeting in Mo Ch'eng</H2><P>This meeting place is on a remote coast. Its back is to the mountains, and it faces the sea. The scenery is very peaceful and beautiful. There are many people in the meetings. The brothers are farmers, fishermen, or potters. Even most of the sisters work in the pottery factories as painters. They are very hungry and thirsty for today's truths. Although no one has gone to work among them, many of them go to all the conferences that we have to listen to the Word. Although they do not have much worldly knowledge, they obey whatever truths they can understand to the extent that they understand it. They know a little about the error of denominations and the characteristics which the church of God should have. Therefore, in the spring of last year, they left their former denomination and began to meet completely in the Lord's name. Most of those who were sprinkled have been baptized by immersion. There are more than sixty brothers and sisters who meet to break bread. There are also about thirty who have been saved and are waiting to be baptized. There are also more than one hundred who are not saved but come to hear the Word. Brothers Chang Ho Ling and Fang Hsing San are responsible for the work and affairs of the meeting.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning of the Meeting in Hou Ts'ang</H2><P>A year ago there were no believers in the locality of Hou Ts'ang. In the fall of last year, Brother Lee Shu Jen went there and rented a building for a gospel conference. He was blessed by the Lord, and in no time, several lovely young men and women received the Lord and became Christians. Brother Lee established the table for them in the building he had rented. From that time, some brothers from the denominations also came over and began to break bread with them. The Lord gradually added a number of saved ones to them. They had a conference recently and were greatly blessed by the Lord. On the day that the conference was over, eight brothers and sisters were baptized. (Three of them were from other localities.) Now there are more than ten brothers and sisters in the table meeting, and more than thirty come to listen to the Word but do not break bread yet. Brothers Lee Shu Jen, Chou Chi Chang, and Hu You San bear the responsibility for the work and the affairs together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning of the Meeting in Ch'ien Ts'ang</H2><P>Ch'ien Ts'ang is about ten miles from the Ao River. Although it is not a big place, the denominations are very developed there. There are the China Inland Mission, an Independent Church, and the Catholic Church. There are many leaders who are very zealous for the denominations, more than in other localities. In the spring of 1932, some brothers and sisters from the Independent Church went to a conference in Feng Ch'uan and heard the word of the truth there. They were very moved, and later they consulted with us. We decided to have a conference in Ch'ien Ts'ang in April. After that conference, a few brothers rose up and changed their form of worship, but that brought opposition from their leaders. There was more opposition here than in other places. They forbade the singing of hymns from the Little Flock Hymnal and did not allow the brothers who loved the truth to preach the Word. Every Lord's Day there was only criticism and scolding from the pulpit. When the brothers and sisters who love the Lord saw this condition, they were really sad. Finally, some of the brothers who were in one accord went to the church building every Lord's Day evening to have the Lord's table meeting. The rest of those who were not in one accord did not attend. They did this for more than a year. The brothers felt that this condition of mixture with the denominations was not according to the principle of the Bible. They wanted to leave, so they looked for another building, but because they did not know how the sisters felt, they continued in the same way for awhile. On the first Lord's Day in March of this year, they were led by the Lord, and the sisters agreed, so they began to have the table meeting in a brother's house. Now there are only three brothers and three sisters breaking bread together. Although they are very lonely, they are very joyful. One of the sister's husbands, Sister Lin Chih Min's, is still holding on to the denominations. Her husband is very upset that she has left the denomination and often is angry with her. I ask the brothers and sisters in all the localities to pray for this sister and ask the Lord to preserve her so that she will stand faithfully. There is a brother, Su Chih San, who also obeys the Lord very much. Unfortunately, he cannot come out to break bread with the brothers because his father is the strongest opposer of the truth. If his son were to leave the denominations, there would be great trouble. So this brother has to wait awhile. May the brothers and sisters pray for him that the Lord would release him to freely worship.</P><P>Chen Ching Fa<br>April 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM KULIN, CHIUCHIANG</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters who faithfully love the Lord:</P><P>We two weak and useless ones want to describe by the Lord's grace how He raised up the table in Kulin and its condition so that the brothers and sisters will know and glorify God and our Lord together. But we are truly afraid that as we are telling this our flesh will be brought in to take away some of God's glory. Therefore, we pray and beg the almighty God to bind our self in this matter so that what we mention will be completely the truth and what God wants us to mention.</P><P>In the spring of 1931, we began to have the meetings. At that time there were four brothers and four sisters in the meetings. Among the four brothers, two were also in the denominations. At that time we still did not break the bread. In the summer, some brothers and sisters from Shanghai came to Kulin to rest. We thought that we could break the bread then. But it did not happen because some people in the Brethren Assembly misunderstood. We received the Lord's leading on December 6, a Lord's Day. (The two brothers in the denominations left Kulin.) We started practicing the table meeting on that day. The number of attendants in that meeting was four brothers (one Western and three Chinese) and five sisters (one Western and four Chinese). Thank the Lord, He led us Himself. Although we did not understand much, He took care of us in everything. He used His Holy Spirit to teach us how to obey Him. By the summer of 1932, He added a number of brothers and sisters. At that time, the pastors of the denominations said we were the Church of the Little Flock. (They misunderstood us because we sang from the Little Flock Hymnal.)</P><P>In November 1932, we went together to Shanghai for the meeting. Three days after we left Kulin, one of the brothers among us, Liu Heng Li, was suddenly taken by the Lord. Satan attacked us especially at that time, causing many difficulties in the meeting, which we weak ones could not resolve. But thank the almighty Lord; He is the beginning, and He is the end. He bore for us the responsibility which we could not bear. There is nothing He cannot do. We thank Him and praise Him and give glory to His name.</P><P>Thank the Lord, this year He chose for Himself our Brother Cheng Tso to come and be in one accord with us. When Brother Cheng was in the meeting in Shanghai this year, he received the Lord's light to know that the Lord wants us to serve Him more than He wants us to work for Him. Therefore, we must learn how to serve Him in the house of God and how to walk in His will. There is a (Western) brother who exhorted him to go out and do a labor of sweat (preaching by his own strength). He knew that it was not God's will and refused. Later, Satan brought all kinds of persecution and sufferings to him. He endured completely in order to obey the Lord and glorify Him. As a result, the Lord was Victor! We also feel deeply that the Lord allowed all this to come upon him so that our brother would know Him more.</P><P>Now there are eight brothers (six Chinese and two Western) and eleven sisters (three Chinese and eight Western) in our meeting. Altogether there are nineteen breaking bread together to remember the Lord.</P><P>Now it seems that there are two brothers (the Western ones), who cannot be absolutely one with us regarding the matter of the rapture. (They believe that the entire body of believers will be raptured at once.) We receive them at the table meeting only because they are saved believers.</P><P>We two brothers bear the burden of all the responsibility of the meeting by the Lord's grace. We only hope that the brothers and sisters who love the Lord do not forget to pray for us, your weak brothers.</P><P>The place of our meeting is now at Number Ninety-four in the winter and on the second floor of Number Thirty-six in the summer. The meeting times are as follows: Wednesday evening at 8:00 p.m., singing and Bible study meeting; Saturday evening at 8:00 p.m., prayer meeting; Lord's Day morning at 10:00 a.m., table meeting.</P><P>The locality of Kulin is very important. There are more than twenty denominations here. We really feel the need of the work. We also hope the Lord will send His own workers to come and explain the truth to enlighten His children. We place this matter in the Lord's hands and before the brothers and sisters. We ask the brothers and sisters to pray and ask that all the Lord's truth may shine in each place during this last age. Amen. We greet you with this.</P><P>Peace to all the brothers and sisters.</P><P>Your little brothers,<br>Yu Hsin Liang and Chi Wen Tsao<br>May 8, 1934, in Kulin</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM SZU HSI, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>Greetings to the brothers in the Lord, Messrs. Kuang Jung and Watchman:</P><P>We have something to ask you now. The county government in our district has ordered every regional and town authority to form local militias which are mandatory. All men between the ages of twenty and forty, both unbelievers and believers, must draw lots and go to be trained for nine weeks in military skills; then they can leave the military. Farmers can continue their farming; workers can continue in their jobs. The second group will draw numbers and go in their turn to learn what the first group learned; then they can leave the service. In this way all the citizens of this region will be soldiers, and the soldiers will be citizens. This is the recent policy of the county government.</P><P> For this reason, in the past few days many brothers have come to ask me what they should do about this matter. I told them that according to the principle of the Bible, Christians should not be soldiers or government officials. Christians can only be killed by others; they cannot kill people. The brothers answered, "If that is so, then they will say we have broken the law, and they will punish us. If we go we will break the teachings of the Bible, and our conscience will not be at peace. If we do not go, we are afraid of what will happen." This really is a dilemma. Therefore, they asked me to write you to see if there is another way to go, a way in which they will not offend God and will not disobey the order of the authorities. Please answer quickly. On the one hand, please help us in the truth and establish us; on the other hand, please tell all the brothers and sisters who pray to pray for us.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Huang Lu Ch'uan<br>March 17, 1934</P><P>(Answer: It is all right to go and learn. The exhortation in Matthew 5 to go an extra mile particularly refers to the soldiers of that day pulling people in to help them. However, in a time of war, we would rather be punished than fight. This matter especially requires much prayer&mdash;Watchman.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM P'ING YANG, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>To the dear one in the Lord, Mr. Nee:</P><P>It has been two months since we parted. We are physically in two different parts of the country, but we can fellowship in spirit. Have you gone out recently to work? Will you have the opportunity to come to P'ing Yang this year? All the brothers here have a common desire that you would come and we could see each other. We also hope to hear some message from the Lord through you. We have been hoping and praying for this for two or three years now. Now must be the time for the Lord to answer our prayers, isn't it? Therefore, all the brothers say, "Mr. Nee will definitely come this year!" I think that there must be the same calling in your heart and spirit. May the Lord remove the barriers that we both could see our desires fulfilled. This would be a great blessing.</P><P>Brother Nee, I will now tell you some of my experience and feelings regarding the work. They are somewhat disorganized, but please be patient in reading them and do not feel bothered. In these past two or three years, the Lord's hand used us few useless bondslaves in the area of Tai Sun, P'ing Yang to speak some of the truths that are crucial to the church today. In the meantime, the Lord opened His children's hearts so that they were more receptive to the truth. Wherever we had a preaching conference, the brothers and sisters always crowded in and hungrily and thirstily desired to hear the Lord's Word. We really thank the Lord for this. But what has made us even more joyful is that most of these people who hungrily and thirstily desired the Lord are very young brothers and sisters. They used to love the world very much. Our speaking did not cater to their heart to love the world. On the contrary, it shattered the world. These young people would have opposed this truth in the past, but the Lord gave them a new heart and a new will. Though alone and friendless, they were willing to drop the world and follow the Lord. The Lord Himself did this work. We useless servants cannot say anything but thank the Lord.</P><P>In these past few years, the messages the Lord has given us have all been for the believers' spiritual cultivation. We have rarely mentioned the matter of the church. But once the believers receive the light, they spontaneously see the error of denominations and tradition. For this reason, many brothers and sisters have been raised up in all the places to leave the denominations they had belonged to and meet in the Lord's name to break bread. This has caused fear in the heart of a group of leaders in the denominations. From what they say, they seem to think, "Many fine believers have turned to them (actually they have turned to the Lord), what will our future be?" In order to hold on to the status quo and keep their organizations, they have had several secret and open meetings. In the most recent days, there was a combined meeting of the Independent Church and the China Inland Mission. This combined meeting lasted for three days. The only thing they talked about was how to deal with the Church of the Little Flock (we absolutely do not confess to this name). Some scolded us mercilessly there. Some presented ideas for stopping our work. Some who were there heard and did not agree, so they spoke about this injustice. They all shouted awhile and then dispersed noisily. This is the attitude of the opponents. Their opposition of this nature cannot shake us. On the contrary, many brothers are seeing more and more what is truth and what is error. But there is one matter that worries us. There are quite a few brothers who appear to sympathize with us on the surface and attack the denominations strongly, but their spiritual condition is very poor. This type of person is causing us much damage and has been a barrier to the truth. I ask you to pray with us to ask the Lord to bind these people that they will not speak anymore lest the opposers have an excuse.</P><P>In the past two months, I have been thinking of something beautiful and sweet in my heart: "The Centrality and Universality of Christ." When I am working, I always feel that there is a fresh flavor and power whenever I mention this message. Oh! This glorious truth is a rich source for the spirituality of all the believers. It is the special focus of the co-workers' work. This glorious news is also closely related to the cross. We can call it the other side of the accomplishment of the cross. I do not know whether you think this is right or not.</P><P>Brother Nee, when I had written to this point, I suddenly received Issue No. 47 of Notes on Scriptural Messages, "The Numbering of Spiritual Days." I read it and really felt both joyful and sad at the same time! I was sad that I do not know how much of my past years have been eaten away by the  swarming locusts, the licking locusts, the consuming locusts, and the cutting locusts! I do not know how many of the days I have passed have been forgotten by God! I was very distressed about the number of days and years that I had wasted! But the Lord also promised to restore those years that were eaten up by the locusts. So my sadness turned into joy! Oh, one day within the courts of Jehovah is better than one thousand days in any other place! Oh, if God still gives me one day's time, I really want to live that day before Him. May each day ahead recapture the thousand days that I lost before. Now I only ask that God would keep me to pass my remaining time with a godly heart! May the Lord's grace be with you. Amen.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Chen Chin Fa<br>April 12, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM TSINAN, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>To our beloved brother, Mr. Nee:</P><P>We have not written you for a long time. We believe that the Lord has certainly blessed you with health.</P><P>Brothers Chang Kuang Jung and Chou Hsin Yi are both well in Tsinan. They are most helpful to our brothers. Now many brothers have been enlivened. I will tell you something of the condition of the meeting here.</P><P>On Wednesdays, Brother Chou Hsin Yi is responsible for leading a Bible study on the truth of the church. We really need it because many of our brothers are not clear about this matter.</P><P>On Fridays, there is a prayer meeting. The brothers and sisters who are able to come all come.</P><P>On Saturday afternoon, there is a meeting for the responsible brothers and sisters. We have recently seen the need for this kind of meeting. On Saturday evening, there is a brothers' meeting. Any question can be asked&mdash;What is following the Lord? What is walking in the way? How do I know the voice of the Holy Spirit? These are questions our brothers have asked.</P><P>On the Lord's Day morning, Brother Chang Kuang Jung is responsible for a building up meeting. There are also many people who come from the outside. Although there are those who come from the denominations and they sometimes debate in the meeting, we maintain a humble attitude, and they cannot find anything against us. In the afternoon, there is the table meeting. On this day we also go out in the streets to preach the gospel. The brothers are zealous in passing out tracts. They are also bold in testifying. However, we still do not see the results of this type of work. It really needs prayer behind it. We also ask the brothers and sisters to pray.</P><P>The recent visit of Miss Lee to Tsinan has rendered much help to the sisters. Some who had backslidden have been revived. The sisters have also clearly seen the center of our testimony. We really hoped that Miss Lee could stay here for a longer time. Unfortunately, she could not do as we had hoped.</P><P>There is now a brother in Tsinan, Mr. Ch'ao&mdash;Miss Lee also knows him&mdash;who desires and pursues spiritual matters very much with his wife. They have good intentions. Therefore, Brother Chang goes to their house to help them every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I sometimes go with him. It is difficult for them to understand much all at once because they have not been saved for very long. Please pray for them. We hope that God will gain them.</P><P>Brother Nee! Now I will write down my own matter. My contract to work in this hospital will expire in a little more than one month. I do not have the assurance that the hospital will continue to employ me. If I continue in that position, I do not know whether I will get a raise or a pay cut! Maybe I will get a five percent cut in pay. I do not know when the provincial hospital will be able to establish a lab. I also hope to be able to go work in the South, but I do not want to go against the will of God. Of course, I can only wait in this situation. But I also ask you to pray for me and keep a look out for a position for me&mdash;there are still eight or nine weeks left. I know this is a trouble to you. May the Lord make you willing to do this for a little brother. Please greet the brothers and sisters for me. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Ch'ien Neng Hsien<br>Evening, May 7, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM TSOU COUNTY, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>Greetings to my brother in the Lord, Watchman:</P><P>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! Amen.</P><P>Thank and praise the Lord! My wife has recovered by the grace and love in the Lord Jesus Christ and by the prayers in His name by all the saints. At the same time, I also thank all the brothers and sisters in all the localities for their prayers and concern for me. Many brothers and sisters who knew our mailing address sent us letters of consolation. They knew of my wife's illness from reading the third issue of Collection of Newsletters.</P><P>We have already rented a meeting hall in Tsou County. It is at Number 1 Chung Sheng Street inside the city. This building is very appropriate in every aspect. This coming Lord's Day we will be able to meet there. We have been praying before God for almost a year. The brothers and sisters in Tsinan and Ling Tzu have also been praying for this matter. We especially thank our Father God for this hall. We also thank the brothers and sisters for their prayers.</P><P>With God's leading and help, the gospel work in Hsi Hsiang Chia Chuang, Tsou County has already started. This place is not very big, but once sixty people came to hear the gospel. There appear to be five or six who are very close to salvation. May the Lord continue His work here. May all come to Him. Brother Chen Po Heng's father-in-law lives in this village.</P><P>May the Spirit of resurrection of the Lord Jesus keep you healthy every day so you can handle the work of God and build up the brothers and sisters through it. I bless you with daily renewing and peace in the Lord! I also greet the believers in Shanghai.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Liu Tien Min<br>April 23, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM DAIREN, MANCHURIA</H2><P>To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Nee:</P><P>Thank the Lord's grace for His all-encompassing love! When we were living a dry and tasteless (spiritual) life, and we seemed like sprouts in a long drought, He gave us the truth which is like anointing rain to comfort our hearts so we could stand on His Word and be strong.</P><P>I have been teaching in Dairen for four years. In the spring of 1932, I met Brother Chiang Ch'uan Ching. At that time, we both felt hungry and thirsty. We often asked the question:  "How can we be free from spiritual dryness?" Some told us it was by going to worship often. But we were already going often. The answer of the so-called Pentecostal group was: Confess your sins completely and pray for the filling of the Holy Spirit. But we had many doubts about what they were doing. However, every morning we would go up on South Hill very early to read the Bible together. After one semester, we were still as hungry and thirsty as before.</P><P>Later, Brother Chiang went to Chefoo and met Brother Chang Chen Ming. At that time, I was in Dairen, living my lukewarm spiritual life and feeling more and more lonely and dry. In the beginning of the fall of 1932, Brother Chang Chen Ming came from Chefoo to Dairen. Through Brother Chiang, we began to communicate with each other more often. In the summer of 1933, Brother Chang Chen Ming came to Dairen from Shanghai. At that time Brother Chiang was also living in Dairen. We talked about the Lord's word often. Thank God for His grace in causing us to hear His truth and to become freemen and to no longer be under the bondage of the restrictions of false rituals. Although the soul resisted at first, thank God, He finally gave us the power to leave the denominations in a bold way and to meet solidly according to the Lord's command. Thank the Lord for leading Brother Chang Chen Ming to help us so much.</P><P>The will of God is so marvelous that we cannot fathom it. After feeding us for awhile, He caused us to be separated. He tested us! After we had been meeting for two months, Brother Chiang left Dairen and returned home. Brother Chang also was transferred in duties shortly after, so he left Dairen also. At the time we were separated, our souls could not avoid feeling lonely. Brothers Chiang and Chang were closer to each other, so they had the opportunity to talk to each other a few more times. I was alone for a long period of time, but I learned an important lesson. I learned that when we are serious about leaving the denominations, we must do our best to exhort one another among the brothers and meet together. If we find ourselves in a situation where we are alone, we should definitely not turn back to participate in the denominations. If we are not careful to protect ourselves, we may be attacked by the evil one. Day by day, we will get colder and colder and will be more pitiful than when we were in the denominations. I am most immature, so I am most susceptible to attacks. Thank the Lord, He woke me up as I was about to sleep. This spring our school shuffled some personnel, and Brother Chiang came back to Dairen as my colleague. From now on, we can exhort each other again.</P><P>We have received all the issues of Collection of Newsletters. Thank you! I think that Collection of Newsletters is a most important thing among the brothers because everything published in it benefits them. This is especially true in a meeting where there are not many people. It is easy to become tired because there are so few people. In reading this publication, we receive encouragement and exhortation. There are very few people in the meeting in Dairen and we are very immature, so I hope this publication can continue to be sent. I respectfully bless you with peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Chang Wen Wei<br>April 14, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM NINGPO, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>Brother Tsai Ch'ing:</P><P>We have been here for seven days now, but this is the first day we have been able to sit down and rest. Actually, Brother Hung is still washing the windows, but my arms and legs will not move anymore. Thank God; we are His workers, not "rabbis" nor "rulers of the synagogues."</P><P>We have already decided on a house at 4 Lo An Lane behind the railway garden in the north shore. This is the same house the sisters saw a long time ago. We paid a deposit of thirty dollars and sixty cents. In the future, we will pay seven dollars and forty cents a month. It is less expensive here than in Shanghai. In these past three or four days, we have been busy with many things&mdash;buying things, sweeping the floor, washing the windows, straightening and arranging, etc. It seems as if "the master is coming and the servants are busy." Actually our heart is just like this. According to ourselves, we could rest and live peacefully, but we are busy now because of Him&mdash;the Lord.</P><P>We have only two fifths of the things we need for our own house. Since God has provided us these two fifths, He will also give us the remaining three fifths. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>Greet the brothers in the Lord for me.

Please greet the sisters for me! Thank them for their prayer. I bless you with this. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>From Yang Fang<br>May 16, 1934<br>Greetings to Sisters Chi Nien and Hui Fen also.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM LIU GUNG ISLAND,<br>WEIHAIWEI, SHANTUNG PROVINCE<br>AND A LETTER FROM BROTHER LIN HSIEN HUI</H2><P>Brother Witness:</P><P>Thank God; although our bodies cannot be together often, our spirits are one in the Lord. Brother, I am on this lonely island by the Lord's arrangement. Although the fellowship is sweet, I have seen that the enemy is very crafty and dangerously evil! I think that the Lord has given me this opportunity to learn how to pray!</P><P>In these past few days, I have felt that there is one thing which I do not have inward peace about. My name is still registered in a denomination. I think that obeying the Lord is an expression of loving the Lord. If I say I love the Lord with my mouth but do not follow it up with my actions, what good is it? (Of course loving the Lord is not just withdrawing my name.) I keep thinking that this is also one of the hundreds of things we must obey in the Bible, so why not obey in God's light? I was originally a member of the Presbyterian Church in Yu Huang Ting. I do not know who the pastor is now, nor do I know the pastor's address. Please write and tell me, and I will send him a letter asking him to remove my name from the register. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your brother,<br>Hsien Hui<br>April 26, 1934</P><P>Please greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord for me. I am adding two questions. Please answer them.</P><P>(1) Removing one's name from the denominations is certainly according to the Bible, and once one is clear about this, one should obey. But I am now on an island without a meeting in the Lord's name. Can I wait for awhile to obey? I am afraid this is Satan's entanglement.</P><P>(2) Because there is no meeting in the Lord's name, I sometimes go to the denominations for the sake of listening to the Word (the so-called worship). But every time I go, I do not feel that this is proper in my heart, because there are so many things of man's will that are not from the leading of the Holy Spirit, although the pastor speaks of the Lord's cross and His precious blood. However, if I do not go, I am afraid that a few new believers will be stumbled by my condition. My life is not rich, I am spiritually immature, and for me to speak to them about the biblical truth would surely not be according to God's will. In summary, after leaving the denominations, is it all right to return to the denominations to listen to the Word because there is no meeting in the Lord's name?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Brother Witness Lee's Answering Letter</H2><P>Brother in the Lord, Hsien Hui:</P><P>I have read your letter. Thank the Lord; He really has worked in your heart! Yes, every brother or sister who is clear about the Lord's light and who wants to go the way of the Lord should leave the denominations in reality and in name. For this reason, everyone who wants to obey the Lord thoroughly should take his name off the denominational registers. Although this is but one of the thousands of things we must obey in the Bible, it is still something we must obey. We should be "faithful in the least" (Luke 16:10). Truly, we should "obey in God's light"! Truly, "obeying is the expression of loving the Lord."</P><P>Here are the answers to your questions:</P><P>(1) We should not "wait for awhile to obey" because there is no meeting in the Lord's name in the place we are. Our obeying the Lord should not be influenced by our environment. Truly, "once we are clear, we should obey." "Waiting for awhile to obey" is really "the entanglement of the enemy."</P><P>(2) Actually, going to the denominations to hear the Word does not benefit us much. (Your own experience is sufficient to prove this.) Since it does not help us, why waste the time? It would be better to follow the Lord's leading and go out at this time to preach the gospel. Once sinners believe in the Lord, you can lead them to walk in the way and meet together with you. You do not have to wait for many. You only need two or three people (Matt. 18:20).</P><P>Since we are clear that the Lord is going to tear down the denominations, it is best not to involve ourselves in any way. We must firmly maintain our position. If we are not separated, we do not have a testimony! The power of a testimony is separation. We should not be afraid of stumbling others in obeying the Lord. If we truly act according to the Lord's will and some are stumbled, we do not have to bear this responsibility before the Lord. When our Lord was on the earth, He never disobeyed God because He was worried about stumbling others. Therefore, He was "for the falling and rising up of many" (Luke 2:34). He is the faithful Rock. Yet He is also the "stone of stumbling" to those "who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed" (1 Pet. 2:8). For this reason, when our Lord was on the earth, He received so much persecution that He became "a sign spoken against" (Luke 2:34). When we walk the Lord's way today, we shall also receive what the Lord received. If we give in a little, if we change it a little, if we move just a little, we will avoid much suffering. But, "let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach" (Heb. 13:13). Please sing Hymns #60, 33, and 131 in the Little Flock Hymnal.</P><P>When we obey the Lord in this way, we should pay attention to one matter of greatest importance: We should have a heart of love when we contact any brother or sister in the denominations. Our attitude should be meek, and our words should be polite. If we have the wrong attitude or if we say the wrong things and stumble them, we will be responsible for it before the Lord.</P><P>We are all very well here. If the Lord allows, I will go to Shanghai next week. (Parts omitted.) I pray for you. Peace be to you.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Witness Lee<br>April 28 in Chefoo</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BRIEF NEWS FROM VARIOUS LOCALITIES<br>(AS OF MAY 18, 1934)</H2><P>(1) We have heard that the two brothers who are imprisoned in Ching Chiang County will be released soon.</P><P>(2) Brother Witness Lee moved to Shanghai from Chefoo at the beginning of the month.</P><P>(3) Sister Yu Su Chen recently went to Yun Ts'ao, Wu Hu, and Hsun Cheng in Anhui province and preached the gospel. People were saved in each place, and the work in Wu Hu was even more blessed by God. Sister Miao Yun Chun has already gone from Ling Tzu to Tsinan. She has testified some to the nurses in Chi Lu Hospital. Later perhaps, she will go to Peking.</P><P>(4) The meeting in Hangchow has moved to a new address: 321 Tung Chieh Road.</P><P>(5) The meeting in Soochow is very peaceful now.

Watchman and Kuang Hsiung:</P><P>All the brothers and sisters in the meeting in Kung Ho City, Taishan have been blessed by God with peace. We moved our meeting to No. 26 Kung Ho City more than a month ago. Since moving, we have been blessed by God very much with opportunities to preach the gospel. But we still hope for more prayers.</P><P>There are about thirty sisters in the meeting, but there are only three brothers. One of them is Brother Ts'ai Chih Yun. He was baptized into the Lord two months ago. He is a doctor. His clinic is near the Church of Christ in China. He has had a good relationship with the preachers in the denominations, but he never would believe in the Lord. He received the book Bible Studies for Beginners (by Brother Nee) and after studying the Bible with this book, he got saved. He also knew that the Lord hated denominations. So he was not tempted by profits, nor was he afraid of taunts. He boldly became one who only belongs to Christ and entered into the name of our Lord Christ, worshipping God the Father in sincerity and in spirit. Now he speaks the gospel zealously and really testifies that the Holy Spirit is with him.</P><P>After I left the Baptist Church on June 29 of last year, thank the Lord, His grace has been sufficient for me. Because I have had blisters on the bottoms of my feet (people in Kwangchow call them Hong Kong feet), I could not go out on the street before December 25 of last year. Even though I am wearing shoes and socks to go out and preach to people, my blisters still have not gotten better! I hope the brothers and sisters in all the localities will pray for me.</P><P>After leaving the denomination, I had many questions I wanted to ask, but fortunately the sisters here gave me many of Brother Nee's books to read, so I received much light. Now I have written my questions (they are published in the answering letter). Please answer them for me. (If you two brothers are busy, please ask another brother to answer them.) May God the Father bless your spirits and bodies with strength and health!</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>T'ang Yen Min<br>May 15, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Answering Letter</H2><P>To the brother in the Lord, Yen Min:</P><P>I have read your letter. Brother Chang is in Tsinan now, and Brother Nee asked me to answer this for him. I will answer your three questions as follows:</P><P>Question: "There is a sister who fasts on the Lord's Day and does not eat pork on Fridays. Although we cannot argue with her about her doubts, can we exhort her?"</P><P>Answer: If this sister fasts on the Lord's Day because she has a burden in her spirit, do not exhort her to stop. You can exhort her to stop fasting if she does not have a burden and you can exhort her to stop abstaining from pork on Fridays, but you do not need to forbid her.</P><P>Question: "Some people believe that they are saved but that if they sin in the future, they still might perish eternally. Are these people weak in the faith, or are they completely unsaved?"</P><P>Answer: If these people have already believed and received the Lord Jesus as their Savior, they are already saved. They think that they could perish if they sin after being saved because they probably do not know the Bible well enough. We cannot say that they are not saved.</P><P>According to the Bible, once a person believes, he is eternally saved and cannot perish. The Lord Jesus said, "Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" (John 6:37). He also said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life" (v. 47). Once we believe, we are not only saved, but we also gain "eternal life." "Eternal life" is the life that lives to eternity. It is the life of God. It can never perish. So the Lord said again, "I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever" (10:28).</P><P>The verses used by some as the basis for perdition after salvation should not be interpreted in their way. Most of these verses refer to entering the kingdom, not to salvation and the receiving of eternal life. (Entering the kingdom and receiving eternal life are two different matters.)</P><P>Question: Is it all right for a brother who has already taken the table on the Lord's Day to go to another place in the evening and break bread with them there?</P><P>Answer: If the "other place" is a denomination, he is eating at the table of a denomination. According to the Bible he should not do that. (Please read Collection of Newsletters, Issue No. 5, for the answer concerning the Lord's table.) We had best exhort this kind of brother through the light of the Bible not to go to the denominations to eat the supper. But we cannot refuse him just because he has gone to the denominational supper also. I respectfully greet you.</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Witness Lee<br>May 22, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM CHU CHIA CHENG TZE, CH'ANG-CH'UN,<br>AND KIRIN, MANCHURIA</H2><P>Peace in the Lord to Mr. Nee:</P><P>Three months have passed quickly since I left you in Shanghai. Thank and praise our Father God for leading us through many trials. I returned to Ch'ang-ch'un with Brother Chang Shun Tien, but I left him after a month. I returned to Chu Chia Cheng Tze, in Pai Li Siang Tsen, northeast of Ch'ang-ch'un. (It is eight miles from the Central Eastern Railroad Halaha Small Station. Communication is very convenient.) I have had a hospital in Chu Chia Cheng Tze for ten years. Because of political instability, I was forced to move to Ch'ang-ch'un for two years. There is a Friendship Church of Ch'ang-ch'un (Presbyterian), and there are two brothers who are very good. They are clear that they must obey the Lord. Soon we will have the table meeting. Later, we will ask Brother Chiang and Sister Chang to come, or perhaps some other brothers from Ch'ang-ch'un will be able to come visit. I can also go to Ch'ang-ch'un once a month. Furthermore, there are many brothers in the three localities of Feng T'ien, Ch'ang-ch'un, and Kirin who are praying earnestly and asking the Lord to send you to Manchuria soon. They desperately hope you can come this summer. We can only ask the Lord for His time, that you could come north soon. May you be full of the power of the Holy Spirit in the Lord to be a victorious testimony for the Lord.

Truly, we want to say in one accord, "I love Jehovah because He hears/My voice, my supplications,/Because He inclines His ear to me; /Therefore I will call upon Him all my days" (Psa. 116:1-2).</P><P>Miss Miao had originally decided to leave Nan Su Chou on the sixth and arrive in Ling Tzu on the seventh. But she had no peace in her spirit, so she left on the fifth and went to Tsinan on the sixth to stay for a night. To her surprise, the train from Nan Su Chou to Tsinan was cancelled on the sixth! Because she had left early, we did not miss her when we met her at the Hsing Tien Railway Station on the Tsingtao-tsinan Line. This is very marvelous! We must sing, "He does not make mistakes, because He is God! He does not make mistakes; He gladly gives grace!"</P><P>On the ninth and tenth, Miss Miao rested. On the eleventh, she went to Ts'ui Chia Chuang to meet with all the sisters. There was also an adulterous woman there who did not eat or drink and had no joy. Her hair was unkempt, and her face looked like a demon. She was a sinner about to hang herself! But after talking to Miss Miao alone and praying with her, she became clear in her heart and wanted the Lord: "So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad." This sister has also been baptized and comes to the table meeting. Oh, this matter truly is His work manifested in her! We all thank Him in one accord! Praise Him!</P><P>On the twelfth, Sister Miao went to Nan Kuan. On the thirteenth, she went to the Wu's house and the Yuan's house in Hsi Kuan and to the Yuan's house and the Han's house in Hsi Men.</P><P>Beginning on the fourteenth, there were eight days of gospel meetings on Kuai Huo Lin Street. The first two days, there was a little pressure from the power of darkness, but then each day was better than the previous one. Thank the Lord that we were never hindered by bad weather. This lasted until the meetings were over. Furthermore, the sisters from far away did not give up because of the sufferings of traveling back and forth every day. The sisters who live near found time in their busy schedules to come hear the gospel twice a day.</P><P>The fifteenth was the Lord's Day, and the local brothers took charge of the meeting. On the twenty-second, we preached as usual, but the building was too small. We could not accommodate those who came to hear the gospel so we had to set up a tent in the garden. Now we have set up mattresses temporarily, because the weather is hot. With regard to building in the near future, if the Lord allows, we will build three buildings during the fall. Please pray for this.</P><P>On the twenty-third, a brother named Wang Shu came from thirty miles away to ask to be baptized. On this day, three brothers were baptized. Truly, "Can anyone forbid the water so that these would not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit even as we?" Thank the Father God and the Lord Jesus Christ; after this was finished, it rained! In the afternoon, we broke bread and dispersed joyfully.</P><P>Beginning on the twenty-seventh, there were eight days of Bible study meetings in the house of Mr. Yuan Ling Shu at Nan Men, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Although Satan did his best to attack the Lord's messenger by making her body weak and her throat sore, she overcame by relying on the Lord! "Blessed be the name of the Lord!"</P><P>On May 5, there was another baptism. Twelve sisters and seven brothers were baptized together. There were also a Brother Chao and a Sister Yuan who wanted to be baptized but could not do so because their parents forbade them! There is a river three miles east of the city called the Tzu River. We found a place for baptism where the water was deep and clear. It was near the boundary between the two towns of Chao Wang Chuang and Tai Fu Kuan. We set up four tents on the sandy beach at the side of the river for the brothers and sisters to change. There were three groups of both male and female observers on the west side of the river, with about thirty people in each group. We stirred up quite a bit of commotion among the inhabitants of the villages! There was even an unbelieving couple in Chao Wang Chuang who were willing to carry a yoke with food and water to welcome us! We did not accept their invitation because we did not have enough time. One brother and one sister from Wang Chuang Sze, about twenty miles east of the city, were also baptized. They came and returned on the same day. We really thank God for His provision and for all the brothers' and sisters' obedience.</P><P>On the eighth and ninth, the brothers and sisters talked with Miss Miao individually. There were so many that Miss Miao did not have any time to rest and became too tired. May God remember her labor and record it in her account!</P><P>On the tenth, Miss Miao took the train safely to Tsinan with a few sisters. Recently, one sister (from Wu Tai, twenty miles west of the city) and three brothers (one from Hsi Kuan, two from Nieh Hsien Chuang, ten miles south of the city) have left the denominations. There are about thirty people from nearby who break bread with us.</P><P>Our labor this time witnessed the enemy's intensive attack, and there were many loopholes. But God was gracious. He caused the unbelievers to come into His name, the believers to obey His commands, the stumbled ones to rise, the broken-hearted to be comforted, and the daughters and mothers-in-law who were distant to be brought into peace. We must thank God again. He said to Moses, "I will have mercy upon whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion." Has not this word come true among us? We also thank all the brothers and sisters for their prayers that accomplished God's will. "To Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen" (Rev. 1:6). Peace in the Lord.</P><P>Your brothers in the Lord,<br>Chu Lo Yuan, Yu Tao Shen, Yuan Chin Chou,<br>Yuan Hsi Ling, Yuan Hsi Chen, Yuan Hsi T'ing<br>We also greet all the brothers and sisters with peace in the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ADDITIONAL QUESTION AND ANSWER</H2><P>Question: There is a newly saved woman here who has received the eternal life, but she has two husbands. One lives away from home and works for others (because they are poor); the other is not a real husband but always lives in her house and receives his livelihood from her. Can this type of person be baptized?</P><P>Answer: She must leave the relationship with her improper husband and produce fruits of repentance to prove that she is a person who has really repented, believed, and been regenerated. Then we can baptize her and receive her into the table meeting.</P><P>Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM YIN HAN CHUANG, HUAI AN,<br>NORTHERN KIANGSU</H2><P>Greetings to the dear brothers in the Lord,</P><P> Brothers Nee and Chang:</P><P>I was in the second ten-day conference and the Bible study meeting that followed. After the end of the meetings, I returned to northern Kiangsu and have not been able to write and fellowship with you until now. I have only communicated indirectly with you through two previous letters that were written by other brothers. But I have not been purposely hiding anything; I was just immature and did not know how to love the brothers with the love of the Lord. I did not know the importance of asking the brothers to pray for me. I was living in the clouds and fog. Thank the Lord for giving me light recently. I know that He is my Head and each of us brothers and sisters are His members making up His one Body, so we should act together and should not hide ourselves. Two years ago, I wanted to write several times to greet you, but the enemy always stopped me with a lying voice that said, "If you write your letter wrong, people will laugh at you." I did not realize you are my elder brother and I am your younger brother, so it does not matter if I write something wrong. Thank the Lord for taking away the veil of my shame so that I can do my best to write about the meeting and the condition of the environment here.</P><P>The place where we meet on the Lord's Day is a sister's house. There are about thirty people in the meeting. Most of them were brought by the Lord out of the China Inland Mission. There are five brothers and eleven sisters who break bread on the Lord's Day. There are others who have not been baptized. Some have only been saved recently. Aside from the meetings on the Lord's Day, there is a meeting for prayer and reading the Bible on Thursday. Brothers Hsu Li Sheng and Yin Ko Ch'u come and meet together with us in that meeting. There are about seven or eight people who attend that meeting. The rest of the brothers and sisters do not come because it is not convenient to travel on the wild country roads at night. They sing hymns and pray in their homes. But we cannot meet during the day because most make their living by farming. Aside from the meeting on Thursday, we brothers sing, pray, and read the Bible individually at home on the other evenings. We all read strictly from the Bible because some brothers and sisters do not know many words. Thank the Lord, on the afternoon of the Lord's Day we remember and worship, and then there is some opportunity to stand up and speak so that we all can receive the help. This spring, on February 14, which is the time the farmers rest, the brothers and sisters here were blessed by the Lord to have six days of meetings which we then continued with three days of gospel meetings. Thank the Lord, He saved another two sisters in our meeting.</P><P>About one year after I believed in the Lord, my wife went to sleep in the Lord. First Corinthians 7:29-31 often works in me. Two months after being baptized, my son returned home sick from Huai An County Central Teachers' School and also went to sleep in the Lord. First Thessalonians 4:13 has comforted me much. Before my son went away, I knelt before the Lord and cried, not because my son was going to die, but because the brothers and sisters in the meetings of two localities, Chang Chia Yao and Yin Han Chuang, were all in an immature condition and did not have any knowledge of the Bible. I was afraid that my experience would affect them, stumbling them and disappointing them, so I cried. Thank the Lord, His power is great! Thank the Lord, His way of salvation is marvelous! The believing ones did not stumble and become disappointed. On the contrary, they even became stronger and bolder. The unbelieving ones saw that he slept without any of the bitterness of death, and they went home and believed the Lord. In these two years, the Lord has saved more than twenty people in Chang Chia Yao. I lived there for five years. The first three years I both taught school and worked for the Lord. The last two years, I quit my teaching job and used all my time to work for the Lord. Last year, the Lord wanted me to return to my home town (Yin Han Chuang). I was blessed by the Lord to build three huts on the foundations of the old home. Because my flesh brothers and I have not separated financially yet, I temporarily teach a few students in these buildings together with a brother in the Lord, Han Ch'ao. Therefore, our meetings are still held in the sister's home. This sister is Ruth Han. Her husband is a member of the China Inland Mission and is also saved. He was not clear about the truth, so he was called by some neighbors to join the army. There has been no news from him since he left. After this sister received the truth, she was persecuted much. Outside the home, the enemies threatened her, and in her home, she was rejected by her husband's family and sometimes tempted by her mother's family. The enemy, Satan, surrounded her with thousands of traps. Thank the Almighty Lord, each time He led her out of danger. Unfortunately, she is too young. We can only commit her to the Lord's hands. Her flesh has been gradually wearing away, so she is often sick. Last winter and this spring, she was extremely ill, and to man's eyes it looked as if she could not live anymore. Thank our Lord, He blessed her and she was able to get up. Now she and Su Hua (my daughter) have gone to Yi Lin together to learn the lessons of the Lord from Sister Chin. Brothers and sisters, please do not forget to pray. I greet the brothers and sisters in the meeting at Wen-teh Lane with this! I also greet all the brothers and sisters in the fellowship!</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Han Shang Chen<br>April 13</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM SUN CHIA CH'IAO,<br>NORTHERN KIANGSU</H2><P>Brothers in the Lord! May grace and peace be</P><P>with you always:</P><P>After the conference in Shanghai was over, I returned home safely! Thank God! Now there are twelve brothers in the meeting in Sun Chia Ch'iao who break bread every Lord's Day. They are Sun Tze Kang, Chi Ju Chun, Chi Tao Hua, Ou Li Hsun, Hsu Tung Lin, Chen Chin Lan, Ko Hsueh Meng, Chou Hui Yuan, etc. The sisters are Mrs. Nee, Mrs. Sun, Mrs. Yen, Mrs. Wang, etc. They all used to be members of the China Inland Mission. Later, they understood the sin of denominations, so they left. There are between twenty and thirty who desire to hear the truth. Thank God, He has led us to receive a little light. About six miles south of Sun Chia Ch'iao, there is a place called Ch'a Miao Chi. It has a Seventh-day Adventist Church. About six miles to the west, there is another Seventh-day Adventist Church in Ma Yu Chi. About three miles north in Chi Tang, there is another Seventh-day Adventist Church. They bother us very much. We are only responsible to pray and to commit it to the Lord. In Ch'ien Chi there is a Seventh-day Adventist Church that wants to change and establish the Lord's table, but they are not sure yet. We have put it into the Lord's hands now. I hope that the brothers will pray and petition for this in the Lord. I thank the Lord for leading me to stand in the position of death now. Furthermore, I sent another letter asking the responsible one at the China Inland Mission to take my name off their records. I am no longer a member of the China Inland Mission. My wife used to persecute me a lot, but now she also has obeyed, thank God. I thank the brothers and sisters who are praying for us.</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Chi Ju Chuan</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTERS FROM KO HSUEH MENG</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Letter One</H2><P>Greetings to Brother Nee who constantly is loved</P><P>by the Lord:</P><P>I received the Lord's call of salvation ten years ago. I was originally in the China Inland Mission at Lien Shui, and I was baptized in the winter of 1924. At that time, although I was a Christian in name, I really belonged to the flesh. I had not left the life of old Adam, and I went along loosely for nine years, shaming the Lord with my living. Oh, now as I think about it, I really am sorry for offending the Lord!</P><P>Fortunately, I received the great love of the Lord, who cannot bear to see His children in constant darkness. In the tenth month of the past Chinese year, He sent His messenger, Brother Jih-chien Chiu, to Lien Shui, Sun Chia Ch'iao to remind us. He held the proof of the Bible for everything he said. Afterwards, I checked it in many ways and found that Romans 6:1-11 tells us clearly that baptism is to enter into the Lord's death and burial. Now we live through the Holy Spirit and are resurrected together with the Lord. After being enlightened a little in that meeting, I boldly and decisively left the denomination. Every Lord's Day, I go to the meeting in Sun Chia Ch'iao to break bread and remember the Lord in order to prove that I am a Christian who has died, been buried, and resurrected together with Him. The body and blood which the Lord gave up was for us believers. We should be very different from the worldly people. Since that time, my heart has felt peaceful. Recently, I have been led by the Lord to leave my work at the local elementary school and to go to teach at Chin Chia Pien Elementary School in Kao Tze Tsen at Chen Chiang. Before I left home, I thought that this was a place of traffic and, therefore, must be a place with a meeting in the Lord's name, so I would not be lonely. Who would have guessed that the Lord's purpose was outside the realm of human thought? He surprisingly brought me to this land of the shadow of death. Although there are more than one hundred households in Chin Chia Pien, they all live by Buddha. There is not one who believes in the Lord. Although there is a church in Kao Tze Tsen, it is also a denomination. Their activities are all according to their man-made rules, so I do not have any opportunity to remember the Lord. Every Lord's Day my heart feels heavy toward the Lord. I do not know if the Lord wants His light to shine in this dark place and slowly bring sinners to believe, or if He is purifying my defects and taking away my impurities. I do not understand. I can only pray day and night, asking Him to lead me out of loneliness and desolation according to His will. School is over now, and I do not have anything to do; therefore, I am writing this disorganized letter with the purpose of telling you, Brother Nee, and the brothers and sisters in Shanghai how I was led by the Lord and how I want to completely enter into Him. I hope for the Lord's sake that you can pray unceasingly for me that I could leave this lonely and desolate condition. Please pray also for my parents and my wife so that the Lord's Spirit will work in their hearts and that they would escape the evil one at home and would glorify the Lord in everything. I greet Brother Nee and all the brothers and sisters in the Lord with peace!</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>Ko Hsueh Meng<br>April 15, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Letter Two</H2><P>To my brother in the Lord, Watchman Nee:</P><P>We were both saved by the blood of the Lord Jesus so we could escape that great perdition. We are supported by the Lord's holy hand daily in order that we can walk the way of the cross in this world.</P><P>But I am most lonely and desolate because there is no brother to contact me in this place where messengers of Satan daily worship Buddha. I only see my class of twenty elementary students all day. Sometimes I testify of the Lord to them, but they always debate with me and refuse to accept Him. I do not know when the Spirit of the Lord will work in their hearts to save them from darkness.</P><P>Every Lord's Day, I have no place to go to break bread and remember the Lord. Although there is a chapel in Kao Tze Tsen, they are Methodist and must listen to the commandments of man. I feel sorry for them, and I worry that my own life cannot grow.</P><P>For the sake of the Lord's love, please announce to the brothers and sisters to pray for this useless little child of God, that he could overcome the world through the Lord's death and glorify the Lord in everything.

I have been thinking much of you. I hope that the truth may become clearer to you and that your path is in harmony with high morality. I have been shown by the Father God something of the principles of the Bible; that is, once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he must learn to obey the Father God. The Bible says, "Awake, sleeper...understand what the will of the Lord is" (Eph. 5:14, 17). We should have a heart to obey. We should imitate Christ. We should leave all man-made policies, and we should leave all divisive names of denominations. I have also examined the New Testament, and there is no name there for this or that church. There is no name like China Inland Mission, Presbyterian Church, Independent Church, Baptist Church, Assembly of God, Methodist Church, or any other denominational name. I think that since God chose His children, our names are already inscribed in the book of life. Therefore, I ask you in love to remove my name and my position from the books of your denomination. I also hope that you will obey God. I bless you with peace.</P><P>A Christian,<br>Liu Heng Teh<br>February 20, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM NINGPO, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>To my brothers in the Lord,</P><P> Tsai Ch'ing and Yueh Chiao:</P><P>I received your letter and the books you sent. Be assured.</P><P>We recently settled into the meeting hall and our living place (upstairs). We have all the things we need for the household, cooking, and washing clothes. Thank God, He has brought us through well in this first stop. Although there were a few small difficulties in the process of moving, they only helped us become mature that we might praise Him in weariness and suffering.</P><P>Since God has now given us this opportunity to rest physically, and since the day has cleared after the rain, we feel in spirit that we see more freshly the beauty of His love. Just as a man suffers endurance for the Lord, he also reaps enjoyment in the Lord. This is what I have learned most recently.</P><P>Since Brother Hung came to Ningpo, he has been living with me. There is a bed prepared for him. Sometimes he goes to his house, but he always comes back here at night. This way I will not be too lonely. He has also helped with much of the heavy work. I really thank God for His fineness&mdash;He has prepared everything for me.</P><P>I do not go to visit the sisters here often. Since coming to Ningpo, I have seen Miss Chang Yu Hua twice and Miss Chen Mei Fang several times. Aside from these visits, I have not gone out. The times I mentioned were to ask about things or to do business. I see that these sisters are very good. They absolutely obey the truth, not like many sisters who like it both ways.</P><P>Since a certain sister has come to Ningpo, the other sisters seem to think it strange that she does not cover her head. This sister also told them clearly why she does not cover her head. I think that it will not be too difficult to answer this question. What is important is still our heart and our attitude.</P><P>With regard to our meetings, there is only a sisters' meeting on Hsiao Wen Street at the Wang's house. We are still waiting for God's time to start the table meeting. God will only be responsible for what He begins, and He will bear the responsibility to the end.</P><P>Now that we have rented this building, people on the outside know about us. In the past week, there have already been two married women (perhaps one is unmarried) and one man who are all "free preachers" that came here to ask me a few questions. I talked with them first about the matters of life. The next day one of the married women brought someone. She wanted to know about the matter of the church. May the God who came here first continue to do His own work. May He also stop human hindrances. Since coming to Ningpo, I am only afraid of one thing, that is, that man will ruin what God has started, because we humans are so foolish, weak, and corrupted.</P><P>I hope you brothers bear the responsibility to pray for the work here and for me.</P><P>Brother Witness Lee is in Shanghai.

In that meeting most of the co-workers expressed the hope that a written testimony could be issued solely for the preaching of the gospel.</P><P>Recently, several co-workers in Shanghai also increasingly felt the burden to publish such a written testimony. We have, therefore, decided to publish a paper entitled The Glad Tidings beginning in July of this year. This publication will be solely for the preaching of the gospel to sinners.</P><P>The contents of this paper will include three columns: messages, stories, and testimonies. The messages will be simple gospel messages, the stories will be salvation stories of believers from the past, and the testimonies will be salvation testimonies of today's believers.</P><P>This publication will be published by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room. We hope that the co-workers in all the localities will bear the responsibility for the articles. We also hope that every time there are baptisms in the meetings of each locality, the co-workers or responsible brothers and sisters will pay attention to testimonies that can help people and will ask the brother or sister to write out his or her testimony of salvation. They can be published in the testimony column of The Glad Tidings. In this way, many who read the publication can also receive help from the testimonies.</P><P>This publication will be free. It would also be good if the brothers and sisters were willing to help with the costs of printing according to the ability the Lord gives them. If the Lord allows, we hope to put out the first issue next month. The following explains how to contribute articles and order the paper:</P><P>Contributing Articles:</P>	<ol class="decimal">	<li>All articles, whether messages, stories, or testimonies must have the preaching of the gospel as their content.

This kind of condition is completely transitory in nature. But I dare not say whether you will get through it. It depends on whether or not you are hungry and whether or not you are faithful. The condition you described is the condition of the first transitional step in passing through the separation of the soul from the spirit. Being inwardly calm and outwardly confused is not a bad condition, but being outwardly calm is an even better condition. Meditation and planning are completely vain when you rely on yourself. But when you rely on God, they are not completely useless. When you have learned to completely rely on God, you can both pray and meditate. You can pray and plan things at the same time. Since your mind is still in rebellion, you feel that using your mind is vain. When your mind has completely obeyed, your conscience will not condemn you for using it, and it will not consider using your mind as relying on yourself. In the book The Spiritual Man I said the soulish life should be rejected, but the organ of the soul can be used. However, in this transitional stage, you have this kind of condition. When you have passed through this gate, your mind will be obedient to God and not rebel against what God says. You can use it when you pray and not be controlled by it. Presently, you can ignore the other feelings.</P><P>You should pray thoroughly before God. You should pray with faith and learn to rely on Him, to only look to Him. By faith, you should acknowledge Him as the only One who can help you. You should learn to unload yourself before Him. Then the Holy Spirit will give you power. You only have to do your part; He will do His part. Brother, please remember, you cannot know or feel the strengthening of the Holy Spirit! You can only pray and trust. He will work without your being aware of it.</P><P>The question of whether the most intimate aspect of the self can completely be removed depends on what you mean by the question. If you mean that you will not feel that you have yourself again, it is impossible. As long as we are on this earth, we will feel the existence of the self. Furthermore, the more the Holy Spirit operates in us, the more we will be aware of the existence of the self. We are living souls. The soul gives us our self-consciousness and makes us feel that we are ourselves. Therefore, as long as we are men, we have self-consciousness.</P><P>Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BRIEF NEWS FROM VARIOUS LOCALITIES</H2><P>According to a letter from a brother in Foochow, during the last week of April, Brother Chung Chun Keng was led by the Lord to go to Chiaochow where he faithfully announced the truth.

He has gradually begun to call His chosen children into His name in Hangchow where the church is in such desolation. On March 19 of last year, we had three brothers and two sisters. We came together in Ch'ing Chun Road to begin to pray that the Lord would establish His table. Then we met every Lord's Day to pray for this matter. In April two more brothers entered into our prayer. Then Brother Chang Kuang Hsiung came from Shanghai to Hangchow for other reasons. He spoke three messages in the meetings. Sister Peace Wang also moved her household to Hangchow for personal reasons and did some work among the sisters. In this way our numbers gradually increased. Because the light which the brothers had received was not the same, we waited until October 22 to begin breaking the bread and remembering the Lord.</P><P>There is one matter which we especially want to thank the Lord for. When Brother Luan Hung Pin received the Lord's call, he boldly and decisively moved out of the Kwang Ch'i Hospital to bear the responsibility for the work. Hangchow desperately needed that type of worker at this time. The Lord's preparation is truly marvelous.</P><P>On December 3, one brother and two sisters were baptized. They were all newly saved. On April 15 of this year, four brothers and three sisters were baptized. Two of the brothers were board members of the Anglican Church. They love the Lord very much and were baptized to obey Him. The rest are all newly saved. Our meeting already has more than twenty brothers and sisters who break bread together. Although many in the denominations do not understand, there are also others who have come to our meetings to see and have said afterward, "The Lord really is with you." We praise the Lord more because of this.</P><P>At the end of May, our meeting place moved from Tao Mao Lane to 321 Tung Chieh Road (at the end of Hua Ts'ang Temple Lane). This building is very big. It can seat five hundred people. But because we are renting it together with the brothers, the meeting only uses a small portion.</P><P>Now we have a perfecting meeting every Lord's Day at 2:00 p.m. We have the table meeting at 4:00 p.m. On Friday evenings at 7:00, we have the prayer meeting. We soon plan to begin a meeting for brothers' fellowship and a gospel meeting on the Lord's Day morning. There are gospel meetings at 30 Chiu Fan Shu every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings at 7:30. These meetings will all gradually witness the Lord's grace. We believe that the Lord has truly begun the work of revival in Hangchow. Honor and authority be to the Father God. Amen!</P><P>Ch'iu Ch'ung Man<br>June 13, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER EXPLAINING<br>THE REASON FOR LEAVING THE DENOMINATIONS</H2><P>(This letter is Hangchow's Mr. Juan Ch'i Yu's answer to Mr. Ch'ien Yi K'ung.)</P><P>Greetings to Brother Yi K'ung:</P><P>I have received your letter. I am very grateful you remembered me.</P><P>Please pay attention to the fact that I have not left the church; I have only left the sectarian denominations. I have not been exhorted to by man but have been directly led by the Holy Spirit. I did not leave the denomination because of some opinion but because of obedience to God's command.</P><P>My main reason for leaving the denomination is that in the denominations the organization is contrary to the command of the Bible. Man has taken over the Lord Jesus' authority. Man's way has taken over the work of the Holy Spirit, so the Holy Spirit cannot operate freely.</P><P>Now in Hangchow, there are brothers meeting in the Lord's name according to the examples in the Bible and in obedience to God's commandments. They do not have the name of Little Flock. This name was added to us by others. We absolutely do not acknowledge it. We absolutely cannot acknowledge it, because the term little flock refers to all the believers from the past to the present and in the future. In other words, Little Flock refers to the true church which includes all the people in the Lord who are in the whole world both Chinese and foreign, both past and present. Therefore, the meeting in Hangchow can only say that it is the brothers in Hangchow meeting in the Lord's name. It does not have the name of Little Flock.</P><P>Since the little flock is the entire church, then the entire church is the little flock. There is only one church on this entire earth. The present so-called churches can only be called a denomination or a mission. Our building at 321 Tung Chieh Road in Hangchow can only be called the place where the brothers in the Lord in Hangchow meet in the Lord's name. Our meeting is completely according to the Bible and follows the leading of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we do not have any names among us, nor does anyone dare to replace the Lord's holy name with his own name, because the Lord is our everything.</P><P>Mr. Watchman Nee is one of our brothers and a brother in the meeting in Shanghai and one of the workers. He is not the chairman. To say that Mr. Nee is the chairman of the Little Flock is others' common assumption. Not only do we not acknowledge this, but he also does not acknowledge it. There is no chairman among us to lead us to do something. This is because our chairman is the Lord Jesus Himself.</P><P>The church is not a chapel, nor is it a place, a name, or an organization. It cannot be dictated by tenets of faith. It is all the people in the Lord.</P><P>The churches which most people talk about now have given in to the world, so they can only be called denominations. They are not called the church. We have left the denominations because they are hated by God.</P><P>In conclusion, whatever name and organization are not in the Bible, we should not have either. Whatever the Bible commands, we should obey. We cannot avoid criticism. It comes because others have not seen clearly! I will again clarify the little flock as follows:</P><P>The little flock is not an organization of man, nor is it a special name. It is how the Lord Jesus, when He was on the earth, referred to all those on earth who believe in Him and have life. When you compare the number of those who believe that Jesus is the Christ with the number of all the people in the world, it really is a little flock. There are one billion nine hundred million people on the earth. Of this great number, there are only six million (according to a certain Westerner's statistics) who are truly saved. When you compare six million with one billion nine hundred million, is it not a little flock?</P><P>Furthermore, the two words little flock were not created by us, nor did we choose this name. The Lord Jesus called the ones who believed in Him a little flock. I fully believe that the words spoken by our Lord Jesus cannot be wrong. What do you think?</P><P>According to the Bible, a Christian who has received the Lord Jesus as his Savior and is regenerated by the Holy Spirit, no matter where he is or what he does, is a member of the little flock in God's eyes. In other words, whoever is not in the little flock does not have life, because a saved person can never get out of the flock. Please pay attention to the fact that this is not my word. This is a fact that the Lord Jesus has established.</P><P>With regard to our meeting in Hangchow at the present, the hymnal we use temporarily is called the Little Flock Hymnal. You cannot say that because we use this hymnal, it proves that we are the sect of the Little Flock and you are the sect of the Big Flock. Please pay attention to one matter; there is no church aside from the church. In the church there should be no sects. Whoever is sectarian, whether in organization or in concept, is manifesting division. Paul said that sectarianism is out of the flesh. I dare to testify in the Holy Spirit that this is against the Bible and is hated by God. On this earth, there can be differences of nationality and race, but in the church of God, there should not be sects or divisions. Once there are things of the flesh, such as self-exaltation, undisciplined ideas, special names, special fellowship, special tenets of faith, etc., it divides the Lord's Body. We need to know that the Lord Jesus is the Head of the church (Eph. 1:22). The church includes all those believers from all times and all places. We are all members one of another. All the members are in the church. This church is the mystical Body of Christ. On the earth, this church is what the Lord Jesus calls the little flock. The little flock is not worldly people; it is those people whom the Lord Jesus redeemed with His precious blood. Peter, John, Paul, you and I, and all the saved ones on earth right now and in the future are in it. Although this flock is small, it includes all those with life. In conclusion, any Christian with life is already in the little flock. Therefore, we should obey the Bible and do our best to pursue holiness and peace to maintain the oneness given by the Holy Spirit. The life which we live on the earth should glorify the Father. I will not say anymore. I bless you with this.</P><P>Your brother,<br>J'an Ch'i Yu<br>June 20, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTERS FROM PEKING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One</H2><P>Dear brother:</P><P>I have not written for a long time. I think of you often! During this time, I have been living a life of warfare in Peking. Although I have failed many times, I believe that God is causing me to learn some lessons. Truly, I now see that to begin to overcome, we must first overcome the flesh. At the same time, He has allowed me to see that Satan is real and active here. Thank God, He wants to lead us to overcome!</P><P>I am not confused inwardly now. I have had the experience of Habbakuk 3:16-19. Because of this, I am not in such a sad and distressed condition as I was before. Truly, thinking of myself all the time is the most miserable thing. May God cause me to forever escape from this cursed self. Brother, please instruct me and pray for me!</P><P>Miss Miao came from Tsinan to Peking a few days ago. There will probably be a few days of women's meetings, but we do not know how the Lord will lead them.</P><P>Mr. Chi, who once wrote an article about correcting the name of pastor and teacher, recently got smallpox in Jehol and died. This event really awakened me to take advantage of today to labor more for the Lord, to watchfully prepare, and to wait to see the Lord's face! (Parts omitted.)</P><P>Now I will speak of the meeting in Peking. I can tell you a little of its condition. Thank God, there has been some revival recently. The brothers bear more of the burden. Those outside the meeting here think that this meeting does not allow outsiders to come to the meetings. I do not know why they have this thought. On top of this, our furnishings are not adequate. We do not have many chairs, so some do not want to come. Thank God, He adds the number of saved ones to us. Some brothers and sisters will be baptized soon. There are many difficulties here, and I cannot relate to you all of them. May God cause us to live more according to His will and to please Him! Please pray for us unceasingly!</P><P>How is your physical health? I often think of you! Greet Brother Witness. I do not want to say too much. I greet you with this. Peace in the Lord.</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Chung Chieh<br>June 8, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two</H2><P>Dear brothers in the Lord, Watchman and Witness:</P><P>I received your letter and read it. After receiving your exhortation, I will do my best to live up to your high expectations. But my knowledge is shallow, and my language ability is not so good. I do not know if I can attain to your hopes.</P><P>Thank the Lord, there was a baptism meeting recently. Three or four people were put into the name of the Lord. Sister Miao might do some work next week. She still has not been able to decide. I hope you will pray for the meeting in Peking!</P><P>If the Lord allows, perhaps there will be a few days of conference meetings at the beginning (or end) of July. May the Lord especially bless this conference so that it will be able to touch people's hearts, causing them to obey the truth and be gained by the Lord. This is the first struggle. I hope you brothers pray much for us so that the Lord will use me, this weak and ignorant little one, to revive His own work.</P><P>Have you been busy with the work recently? Have people been sending articles to Shanghai? I think of you often! Greet the brothers and sisters for me! I respectfully bless you. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Chung Chieh<br>June 18, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM CH'ANG-CH'UN,<br>MANCHURIA</H2><P>Peace in the Lord to Brother Chieh Mei:</P><P>The year has passed quickly since we parted at the port in Ch'ang-ch'un. Thank and praise the Lord for leading me on to His proper track. But I am weak and have failed God. Because I cannot even care for myself, I do not have the strength to help others. I am not the only one like this; most of the brothers here are in this condition. We are really shallow and do not have many roots. Brother Chiang Shun T'ien is the only one who leads the meetings. Brother An has returned to the country. The most important thing is for some to come to help us and support us on our way. I heard that Brother Watchman Nee is now in Shanghai. Brother Nee promised before that he would come here to see us. Now we  are truly hungry and thirsty for his coming. May the Lord accomplish this by sending him here quickly. I also ask you to visit our brother and invite him personally for us, since you are near to him. Ask him to remember us in the Lord and to come quickly. This is our strongest hope. I ask that the Lord keep you in peace. I also greet all the brothers in Shanghai with peace.</P><P>Your not-so-wise brother,<br>Ou Ya Heng<br>May 19, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM CHU CHIA CHENG TZE, CH'ANG-CH'UN, MANCHURIA</H2><P>To Brother Luan, the co-worker in the Lord:</P><P>I received your letter which was forwarded to me from Ch'ang-ch'un yesterday. I was very happy. I really thank the Lord who loves us that He opens doors everywhere and leads us in all places. The Lord is drawing brothers and sisters in your locality to meet in His name. May the Lord release those who have been in the bondage of the regulations of man and lead them into His freedom. May the Lord also personally raise up those who love Him to bear the responsibility for the meetings so that you can hand over the responsibility for the meeting in Hangchow to the local brothers. Then you can come back for the more needed testimony. In March my whole family moved back to Chu Chia Cheng Tze to resume our work in the hospital here. In the future I will not be able to go to Ch'ang-ch'un often. On May 20 we began to have the table meeting here to remember the Lord. Thank our Father God, there are three brothers who are very clear about the truth and who are willing to meet in the Lord's name. There are also a few sisters. I went to Ch'ang-ch'un on June 1 and saw Brother Chiang. They have really been blessed by the Lord there. They have already rented three buildings for their meetings on Hsi Szu Ma Road in Sister T'ien's obstetric hospital. We have notified the government; they also welcome our faith. Brothers T'ien P'ing Fang and T'ien Hsin Wu, from east of Ch'ien Yi, will probably be able to come here for a rest in July or August and will also conduct the Bible study. Perhaps they can go to Hangchow to visit you. In Harbin there is a new Pentecostal group, the Assembly of God, in addition to the other denominations. In their work, they only speak of being filled with the Holy Spirit, speaking tongues, and doing miracles. Whoever does not speak in tongues is not saved. (Parts omitted.) Therefore, Harbin desperately needs the light of the truth. I hope that the Lord's time comes soon to release the captives. The work in Manchuria desperately needs the truth. Many people are praying to God to send Brother Nee here. Please remember us and the needs of your hometown before the throne of grace. Furthermore, Manchuria is short in the sisters' work. Sister Miao promised to come here, but she has not written us again. Perhaps she is now working in Peking and Tientsin. May the Spirit of the Lord be with you and the brothers and sisters in the meeting in Hangchow. Amen.</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>An Ching T'ien<br>June 8, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM YI LING, NORTHERN KIANGSU</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters who pray for us with a pure heart:</P><P>Thank the Lord, He has blessed our recent work. I will now report on the beginning, history, and ending of this work. There is much to thank God for. Glory to the One on the throne and to the Lamb.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Meetings before the Conference</H2><P>Before this conference even began, a few of us co-workers and a few brothers and sisters who pray to the Lord met every afternoon at 3:00 to have a prayer meeting to offer specific prayers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Items of Prayer</H2><P>(1) We asked the Lord to give us a work for His own sake and for the sake of the Body and the kingdom.</P><P>(2) We asked the Lord to gather those who needed to receive these teachings from His house (the church).</P><P>(3) We asked the Lord to work with us to bind the enemy and stop his actions and to release the brothers and sisters who were bound by the enemy.</P><P>(4) We asked the Lord to give us an appropriate building where the sleeping, eating, and meetings will not be a problem.</P><P>(5) We asked the Lord to supply us and bless our every need in the matters of life, physical needs (money), health, weather, and other necessities.</P><P>(6) We asked the Lord to allow us to see Him in everything in the work.</P><P>(7) We asked the Lord to capture a group of brothers and sisters to stand firm for Him.</P><P>The items listed above were the goal of the prayer in our daily prayer meetings. We prayed for half a month.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Decision</H2><P>We received the Lord's answer, so we decided that beginning April 7, there would be a sisters' work. Beginning on May 7, there will be a conference for all the responsible brothers and sisters from all the localities in northern Kiangsu. We sent letters of announcement to all the localities.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Announcements</H2><P>On the one hand, we notified all the sisters in all the localities of northern Kiangsu that whoever could learn to read should come to learn before April 7, and on the other hand, we invited the responsible brothers, sisters, and co-workers to come to Yi Lin on May 7 for a conference. At the same time, we asked the supplicating brothers and sisters to pray for this matter (see Collection of Newsletters, Issue No. 5). Within a few days it was April 7.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning of the Sisters' Work</H2><P>There were more than thirty sisters who came from a distance. Together with the sisters from this locality, there were sixty people. We began the work in our original meeting place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Condition of the Work</H2><P>There was prayer every morning from 9:00 to 9:15. From 9:15 to 10:00, they learned to read. From 10:10 to 11:00, they sang hymns. From 11:10 to 11:50, they read the Bible. In the afternoon, they prayed from 2:00 to 2:15. They learned to read from 2:15 to 3:00. They sang hymns from 3:10 to 4:00. They practiced writing from 4:00 to 5:00. There was a meeting in the evening from 7:00 to 9:00. Every day was like this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Time</H2><P>There were a total of twenty-four days. In these twenty-four days, there was a prayer meeting every afternoon at 3:00. Some brothers also attended. This prayer influenced the enemy in Hades to do a great work and to open fire in the spiritual realm.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Battle</H2><P>As the sisters' conference was about to end, the enemy caused the children of God to suffer. He made Miss Chin, one of the sisters responsible for the work, sick. But another brother helped, replacing her in the work. A Gentile who was possessed by a demon came. In the meeting, there was a brother who was cheated by an evil spirit. (This brother meets in another locality; he is one in the fellowship, who had come to stay here.) There was the attack of the Gentiles and confusion in the meeting. The workers were weak, and darkness was on all sides. The atmosphere was very tense. But our Lord is the Commander-in-chief. The battle plan did not change; the work went on as usual. In our prayers we added more praise and thanks. We sang songs of victory. Hallelujah, we fought persistently for three days.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Change in the Situation</H2><P>The Lord is the Victor! The Gentile demon was cast out. The evil spirit who had tricked the brother temporarily left him. His mind became clear. Miss Chin's illness gradually got better, and she was healed in a few days.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Final Victory</H2><P>The sisters' work ended on schedule. Most of the sisters who lived far away went home and arrived safely. At the end of the work, four sisters were baptized, and so were four brothers. (The brothers had received the Lord in another work.) The demon completely left the Gentile. Now she comes to hear the message on the Lord's Day. The brother who had been tricked by the evil spirit became completely clear in his mind and told us himself how he had been tricked (explained in another place). He got on the train by himself and returned to his own town. We gained experience in this battle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Those Who Gained Experience</H2><P>When the enemy was roaring, a few of us brothers in this locality (those who pray in one accord) gained a living experience in the matter of spiritual warfare. At the same time, we proved the reality of the truth. Therefore, on May 7 we were willing to serve the brothers in the dormitories.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning of the May 7 Conference</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Preparation of the Meeting Place</H2><P>When we sent out the letter of announcement about the conference, we did not yet have any assurance about the meeting place. As the sisters' work was almost over, a brother finally was able to borrow a bigger place, which was the place we had specifically asked for in our prayers. It had nineteen buildings; the dormitories, meeting rooms, and dining halls were all in one place. There were no difficulties.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Brothers Who Came to the Meetings</H2><P>There are more than ten localities in northern Kiangsu with meetings in the Lord's name. With the exception of one or two places who could not come because of obstacles, there were one hundred responsible brothers and sisters from the other localities who came. With the addition of the local congregation, there were a little more than two hundred people. Among these some had overcome everything to come; some put every consideration aside. I really thank the Lord; He can draw people. "My sheep hear My voice." "Where I am, there also My servant will be." This word is true. The people we had notified were not the only ones to come to the conference. Some preachers from the denominations also came to hear the Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Time of the Meetings</H2><P>We met from 9:30 to 11:30 in the morning. There was another meeting in the afternoon from 3:00 to 5:00. In the evening we came together for a prayer meeting from 8:00 to 9:00.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Topic of the Messages</H2><P>The topic was "The Messengers of the Churches." It covered Christ as the Head of the church, how the messengers should obey Christ, who is a responsible messenger in the churches, the relationship between the messengers and the church, and the messengers and their living. The first few days, Brother Chi Yung Tung was responsible for the messages. The last three days, Brother Chiu Jih Chien spoke on the faithfulness and tests of the messengers and on the responsibility which each person should bear in the local churches. Wu Min Hui spoke a little on the battles of the messengers. I spoke something on the warnings to the messengers and the oneness of the church. Brother Ting Yi Yuan wanted to speak something on the authority of the church, but the hateful enemy frustrated him. When it was time for him to speak, he got sick. (He is well now.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Environment of the Meetings</H2><P>There was a sudden rain on the night of May 6. On the seventh the weather cleared, and it did not rain until the evening of the seventeenth. Thank the Lord for listening to man's prayers. At the beginning the enemy attacked fiercely, but he failed from beginning to end and did not gain anything. In these ten days of meetings, the atmosphere was very light and full of the power of the Holy Spirit. The listeners were quiet and solemn. This was the Lord binding the enemy, so he did not have the opportunity to manifest his actions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Service of the Brothers</H2><P>During this conference all the brothers lived in one place. (The sisters lived in another place; they lived in a sister's house.) All the aspects of the service (down to the lighting of the fire) were done by the brothers together; a few things required great strength, so we hired outsiders for the work. We really saw the Lord with us. The believers "were all together in the same place"; it was very good. Love one another! Each according to his ministry! According to the function of each one member! Serving the Lord and serving the brothers is such a joy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Testimonies of the Co-workers</H2><P>Aside from the message meetings, there were a few fellowship meetings. They solved quite a few difficulties in the church and resolved barriers to the work. They enabled co-workers to all speak the same thing and to testify to the truth in this generation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Last Evening of the Conference</H2><P>The local brothers served the brothers and sisters from other localities with snacks. Through this they got to know one another and were able to fellowship with one another. "They partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart." The room was full of joy as if the disciples had "seen the Lord."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>After the Conference Was Over</H2><P>The conference was over on the seventeenth. Every brother and sister returned to his or her own locality. Only a few co-workers remained to discuss a few matters. Brothers Ting Yi Yuan, Feng Hsien Chih, Chi Yung Tung, Chiu Jih Chien, Chen Yung K'uan, Wu Min Hui, and Wu Wei fellowshipped about the work and about past endeavors and future needs. We give glory to the Almighty for what happened, and we ask God for three great necessities in the future: (1) The meeting in Yi Lin lacks the funds for the purchase of the hall, even though the hall is appropriate; (2) there are many brothers who have lost their jobs, and we need to know how to meet their needs; and (3) we need schools where the children of the believers can study. We placed these three matters in the Lord's hands and looked to His arrangement and will. "We praise Him for what is past; we rely on Him for what is to come." We still ask the dear brothers and sisters to pray for these matters.</P><P>I give you this simple report today to lift up the Lord's victory and to establish our faith. May glory be to God, and may blessings of peace be to us.</P><P>Your brother in the Lord from Yi Lin, northern Kiangsu,<br>Wu Wei<br>June 5, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM CH'ANGSHA, HUNAN PROVINCE</H2><P>My very dear Brother Hu:</P><P>I have now received your letter written May 26. My heart thanked the Lord very much after receiving it because He has His lovers in every place. I really hope the Lord will raise up those who will be willing to pay the price to obey Him. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>Brother, we should only care for the pursuit of His kingdom and His righteousness, and the Lord will take care of the rest. Thank God, this is our special blessing.</P><P>I really thank the Lord for the work here. He always hears our prayers and always works to save men and build them up. There are newly saved ones and there are seeking ones. But there are quite a few difficulties because Satan is working to sow division among the brothers and the sisters. There is one other thing that I do not know how to deal with today. A brother saw a vision while praying and claims he saw God. He says that he has gained much wisdom and that Paul's experience in the third heaven was not just given to Paul. He has also raised himself up very much. He says that even if he reads the Bible casually, he can know everything because he has great wisdom, and that he can grasp and understand what he did not understand before. Actually, he does not know much. I have exhorted him a few times not to treasure miraculous experiences more than the Word of God. The most marvelous thing is that I recently received the last issue of The Overcomer from England, which also mentioned in its last article that ignorant believers can despise others after having miraculous experiences from Satan. O brother! These truly are the end times!</P><P>I am now pursuing the Lord's Word. That precious Word carries power in every sentence. The Lord's Word is firmer than the heavens and the earth. The house built on the solid rock is not the one who can preach, cast out demons, and work miracles, but the one who hears the word of the Lord and does it (Matt. 7:24). Who are the ones who love the Lord? The one who keeps His word (John 14:21, 23). What is the light at the judgment seat? The word of the Lord (John 12:48). May the Lord give us grace to realize that when we give an account before the Lord in the future, it will not be based on our experience of the third heaven but on His Word. May God's every commandment touch my heart. Amen.</P><P>There have been some students from a Bible school who have come from quite a distance to study the Bible with me recently. Some of them are quite hungry and thirst much. May God fill them up.</P><P>Brother Hu, one as weak as myself, especially needs the prayers of the brothers and sisters. Please greet the brothers and sisters for me.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Yu Cheng Hua<br>June 1, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM YU NI, TUNG AN,<br>FUKIEN PROVINCE</H2><P>Peace to my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Nee:</P><P>Although I have not communicated with you much since parting with you in Shanghai, I remember you always in the Lord.</P><P>Dear brother, I truly thank God always for you. When I pray, I also mention your work for our gracious Lord. May our Lord Jesus Christ strengthen you and bless your work by faith, your sufferings of love, and your endurance of hope.</P><P>Brother, I truly thank the Lord because He is leading us step by step. When I was groping in the darkness, He put me in a lonely, quiet country place. In these two years, He has disciplined me, built me up, and made me learn the lessons I needed to experience in order to serve Him. He really graces me, leads me, and keeps me in His grace day by day. He disciplines me so that I may see my own corruption more and more and see the preciousness that is in Him. The Lord said, "Apart from Me you can do nothing." I have only just seen this sentence. It truly is limitless light.</P><P>Brother, our heavenly Father is truly the loving Father. He has unlimited mercy and unlimited grace. In the past days, I was discouraged and disappointed many times. Each time He comforted and encouraged me. Although I am sometimes confused and fail many times, He graces me much and has mercy on me so that I will know His love and my hopelessness. The more I think of the love of the Father, the more I feel ashamed of myself.</P><P>Brother, I really thank God that apart from the most precious Bible which He has given us, He has given me The Present Testimony and books like The Spiritual Man. To tell the truth, apart from the Bible, I have received much light from these books. Many times when I am touched by what I have read, I kneel down to thank and praise the Father, saying, "God, I thank You because apart from the precious Bible, You have given me this kind of precious spiritual food, The Present Testimony, etc." Truly, since receiving the light of the truth from these books, I could not fail to give thanks for these books and pray to God. May God build up His children more through the messages in The Present Testimony and the books like The Spiritual Man. May He cause His children everywhere to really benefit from the release of the truth. May the Lord bless the messages in these books so that His truth will be realized soon to glorify Him. Amen!</P><P>I have added a letter concerning the news of the meeting in Yu Ni and prayer requests for the furtherance of my work.

We should praise Him.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, since we have received the Lord's love and His light, should we not be in fear and trembling as we carry out the Lord's commission? May the Lord keep us and lead us so that from now on we will serve Him more faithfully and give all glory to His holy name. Amen.</P><P>I am sure that all the brothers and sisters care for the condition of the church here. For this reason I am constrained to tell you something of our condition and experience. May we thank and praise God together.</P><P>According to the brothers here, our meeting began in the winter of 1928. Brothers Faithful Luk, Wang Teng Ming, and Ch'i Wen Yu came to preach the gospel. Later, it became a place known for the preaching of the gospel. In 1930 and 1931, Brother Ts'ai Chih Ch'ung and I came a few times to preach the gospel. At that time, I had only started to work for the Lord and had not yet received the light concerning the truth of the church. So I did not have the faith to be responsible for the work here. Therefore, I went to Southeast Asia to testify for the Lord's gospel. Later (in the winter of 1931), I was led by the Lord to return from Southeast Asia and attend the second conference in Shanghai. Thank the Lord, I received the truth concerning the church at that conference. Therefore, I began to bear the responsibility for the work here. Although there were people saved at the time, there was not a table meeting yet because there were many barriers. If I remember correctly, it was in the fall of 1932 that the Lord Himself began to work. A few brothers began to feel the need of a table meeting. We began to have a table meeting every Lord's Day. (Before, there had been a few times when two or three had met to break bread.) There were only a few people then (about six or seven). Now more than twenty people have been baptized, and twenty-one break bread together: nine brothers and twelve sisters. (Some heard the gospel and were saved, and some came out of the denominations.) There are more than seventy who come to hear the Word but do not break bread yet. We have three meetings on the Lord's Day. There is a gospel meeting in the morning. There is an edifying meeting in the afternoon from 1:00 to 3:00, and after 3:00, there is a table meeting to remember the Lord. Every Thursday afternoon, there is a prayer and Bible study meeting. There are more than twenty people in that meeting. With the exception of the gospel meeting, the edifying meeting, and the Bible study, which are led by the co-workers, the other meetings are according to the principle in 1 Corinthians 14.</P><P>Most of the brothers here are farmers. Some have never been to school. Thank the Lord, they can now read the Bible and Notes on Scriptural Messages. Although some of them have to bear much burden, they are very happy in their hearts and spirits. I cannot refrain from praising the Lord when I see their condition.</P><P>Two young brothers have been raised up by the Lord to prepare to work full-time in the Lord's holy work.</P><P>Most of the brothers are young. They care for the affairs of the church very much. Presently, there is a possibility that they will bear the responsibility themselves. Therefore, I feel that I should now leave this place and move on to fight the Lord's battle on the front line. May the brothers and sisters who love the Lord pray much for the work here and ask the Lord to keep the saints and lead them into the deeper truths, so they can glorify the Lord's name. Amen.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I now have an important request --when you pray, remember this poor dark region of western Fukien. There is a total of several hundred thousand people in western Fukien who have never had the opportunity to hear the gospel of our precious Lord.</P><P>With regard to this matter, I have felt this burden for quite some time. However, in the past, because so many things were happening and because it was my period of training in service to the Lord, the Lord did not open the way to fulfill this burden. Now I feel that the time has come. If the Lord is willing, perhaps between the next two Lord's Days, I plan to go to Lung Yen in western Fukien to pioneer the Lord's work. In the near future, perhaps another brother will be willing to go with me. In that region, there are perishing lambs throughout the wilderness, waiting for people to seek them out. The work of the devil has been increasing daily since the Communist revolution. Therefore, the people in that region are suffering in heart and body. One can imagine the harsh environment they are under. It will be hard to capture the hearts of those in the devil's territory unless we have the Lord's power. For this reason, I deeply hope that the brothers and sisters who love the Lord faithfully in each locality will sympathize with the inward parts of the Lord Jesus more and pray earnestly night and day to labor with me.</P><P>There are about one hundred fifteen thousand people in Lung Yen. None of them have heard the Lord's gospel. Although there are two denominations in Lung Yen, there are less than two hundred people who go to them to listen to the Word. When I see such a condition, my heart aches.</P><P>According to the flesh, Lung Yen is my ancestral home. In the winter of last year, I went to preach the gospel once with my brother. I went again to the marketplace by myself to preach the gospel over the Chinese New Year. I had more than thirty opportunities to preach the gospel. Praise the Lord, His blessing was with me. Sinners were saved, and the believers became more desirous of the Word. We witnessed some results through these meetings. Now the believers there have a heart for the truth. I feel that at this time, I should do some edifying work among them; if not, I am afraid I will be helping the work of the denominations.</P><P>However, the voice of opposition has been raised through the presentation of the truth of the church and baptism. Recently, a Western man (a so-called pastor) wanted the believers to join the denomination. Because I had already preached something concerning baptism, many people were affected. Therefore, this Western man and a few others said that I was welcome to help them to be zealous, but I could not preach about the matters of baptism, etc. If I continued to preach, they would turn against me. This Western pastor used to be a friend of mine, but recently because I have been walking a different way, he began to dislike me. Brothers and sisters, at the beginning I was almost trapped by friendship. Thank the Lord, while the Spirit and my lusts were warring, I read what Paul said to the churches in Galatia: "For am I now trying to win the assent of men or of God? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a slave of Christ" (Gal. 1:10). Brothers and sisters, this verse was the strongest help to me to leave the error of tradition, to obey the Lord, and to take the God-ordained way with you.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I not only ask you to care for the pioneering work and to pray, but even more I ask you to pray for me, your weak brother, that I would have the utterance to boldly speak the mysteries of the gospel according to the ministry entrusted to me. Peace in the Lord.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Teng Chih Ch'eng<br>June 15, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM SWATOW, KWANGTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>Peace to Brother Chia Ju:</P><P>I received both your telegram and letter and have read them both. Sisters Ruth Lee and Liu Hui Fen both arrived here safely. More than ten people went onto the boat to receive them. The Shantung steamer arrived early Wednesday, so that evening the sisters gathered at the meeting hall for some fellowship. Although there was no message, all the sisters felt very satisfied and happy. On Thursday the sisters received people individually for the entire day. Both those who take the table and those who do not could speak with them individually. In this way they found out the needs of each one and received direction for their preaching.</P><P>On Friday and Saturday evenings there were meetings on the topic of general salvation. There were more than two hundred people. Mrs. Nee and Miss Sun P'ei Fen did the translation. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>Miss Lee plans to go to Tai Shan for a week after the twenty-sixth. Then she will return to Swatow, from where she will go on to Fukien.</P><P>From Monday through Friday of this week, there were two meetings, morning and evening. In the morning, we had a message meeting on a specific topic that began at 9:00. The topic was John 6:63. The evening meeting began at 7:00 and was for answering questions. The sisters asked questions concerning spiritual life and practices. Questions on spiritual life included, "How do we hear God's voice? How do we know God's will? How do we obey? etc." Questions on practices included such things as head covering, not cutting one's hair, etc. There were about two hundred people in the meetings.</P><P>God did a marvelous work, and many believers were built up. Thank God. Not long after, ten more people were baptized. Now there are twenty brothers and forty-one sisters who break bread together. May we praise the Father because He has begun a good work in Swatow. All the glory should be given to our Father.</P><P>With regards to the building of a meeting hall, we are going ahead with our planning, on the one hand, and asking God for His provision, on the other. In the past month, we have received more than three hundred dollars. Our plan requires two thousand five hundred dollars. We are short about two thousand dollars. But we are not discouraged by the lack. We believe that our God will make it up. It is just a matter of time.</P><P>According to Miss Lee's opinion, we can ask God to fulfill our goal in two ways: One is for the assembly to collect the offerings and build the meeting hall --then we would not have to pay monthly rent; the other is for some of the believers (one or a few) to build a simple hall and rent it to the assembly. The assembly would pay monthly rent, but it would be cheaper than renting a place from a Gentile.</P><P>It is better to ask the Lord to open up one of these two ways than to only ask Him to open one way. The brothers have no opinion. However God chooses to accomplish His will is fine. What is your opinion? Please tell us what you think.</P><P>(Of the two ways mentioned above, the second is better. --Editor) (Parts omitted.)</P><P>I have heard that Brother Nee will be going to Kuling in Foochow for the summer. Perhaps he will do some work in Foochow. Is this true? I have only heard rumors. When he comes to Fukien, will he pass through Swatow and go to Hong Kong? Please ask him for me and greet him for me.</P><P>Miss Lee says that Shen Ting Ling is very ill and vomits blood and feels dizzy. Oh, this brother loves the Lord very much. He lives every day on the cross, deals with the self-life, and is always making new progress. We should pray for him. May God preserve his life because both Brother Nee and I want to invite him to Swatow. If the Lord wills, it will be accomplished. I ask you to pray for this matter. I also ask you to wire him $____. I will repay this amount through Mr. Cheng. Please visit him for me and see how his illness is progressing. Ask him if there is anything he wants to say to me. You can write it to me on his behalf. I am afraid that he cannot hold a pen. I am grateful to you for spending this time. I know that God will repay you.</P><P>Brother Faithful Luk from P'u T'ien and Foochow has come for three weeks. He will have one gospel meeting here. Last week he went to Yen Wu to preach the gospel. Some brothers went with him. I also spoke for three days. This week he has gone to Fu Cheng. He has already been gone for two days. In a couple of days, perhaps I will go there to speak for a day or two. I do not know if I can or not. The people in the denominations hate me and say I steal lambs, so I am not very free. We only ask God to open the way. I will leave the rest of the matters to my next letter. Health in the Lord to your spirit, soul, and body (3 John 2).</P><P>Your brother,<br>Chiang Tze Hang<br>June 19, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BEGINNING AND EXPERIENCE OF THE MEETING<br>IN WENCHOW, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>Thank the Lord because in these last days He has personally cared for us small ones. In 1931 the Lord sent His servants to Wenchow to preach about the truth of the church. This enlightened us in regard to the unscriptural nature of the forms and system of the denominations. Although there are quite a few believers in Wenchow, very few understand the truth. At that time, a few brothers began a worship meeting in the South Gate China Inland Mission after they gained the light. They broke bread to remember the Lord every Lord's Day. After a few months, some who were not in one accord in the China Inland Mission rose up to oppose! So we gathered a few of the brothers and sisters who were in one accord and met upstairs in a brother's house in Nan T'ang to worship and break bread in remembrance of the Lord. Thank the Lord; although there were only seven people, the savor among us was very sweet, because the Lord was with us. After a few months of meeting like this, those in the denomination outside the South Gate were afraid that an outward division would hinder the future development of their church. They had a meeting and exhorted us to meet together with them to worship the Lord. We saw that they had a heart for the Lord and thought that perhaps the Lord would raise up His work among them to revive His children. So we began to meet with them. In the spring of 1932, a sister who lived on Chu Kuan Lane of Hsin Ho Street was raised up. She was willing to let us use one of her apartments on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for Bible study meetings. The Lord also sent a worker to bear the responsibility for this Bible study. Although the location was more than ten miles from our place in Nan T'ang, we felt satisfied every time we went to the meetings there. On the Lord's Day we continued to go to the place outside the South Gate. In August or September, another small number of people in the denomination arose to oppose again. They said that the worship service was too long and that it was too much to break bread every Lord's Day! At the time, we saw that they did not obey the truth, so we separated from them and established the Lord's table in Chu Kuan Lane. In this way we completely separated from the denominations. The enemy did not want us to meet peacefully, and by the spring of 1933, he began a great work among us. A big problem occurred, and we could not continue meeting there lest we offend the Body of the Lord. At that time, the Lord sent His servant, Brother Lai, to help us. He knelt before the Lord with a few of us who were in one accord and asked the Lord to prepare a meeting place for us. Thank the Lord, in April we received what we asked for. We rented three two-story houses at 12 Sha Mao Ho Ta T'ing. Brother Lai and one of the brothers in one accord lived there. Our attendance at that time was low. Brother Lai took charge among us for a few months. At that time, we set the meeting times for Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings. Around November the Lord also sent His servant, Brother Wang Yu T'ing, to come with Brother Lai to meet with us for four days. We were greatly edified. We really thank the Lord.</P><P>In April of this year, the Lord sent two other workers, Brothers Chen Chin Fa and Ts'ai Ch'i, to come meet with us for seven days. They gave us much help. During this time two brothers and one sister were baptized into the Lord's name. Now the Lord has gradually added a number of saved ones to us. At this time there are thirteen brothers and fourteen sisters who break bread together. There are over thirty people who meet together. Recently, the meetings are as follows: Every Tuesday, there is a Bible study; every Thursday, there is a perfecting meeting; every Saturday, there is a prayer meeting; on the Lord's Day morning we worship and break bread in remembrance of the Lord; on the Lord's Day afternoon, we preach the gospel, and in the evening, we learn to sing hymns.</P><P>Thank the Lord, through all the ups and downs, He has kept us until today so that we could faithfully follow Him. We have just mentioned something of the condition and the work that the Lord has raised up in our Wenchow. We ask the brothers and sisters in every place to thank the Lord for this and to pray for the work to come, that His will be done among us. May glory, honor, blessing and thanks all be given to Him forever. Amen.</P><P>Your brothers,<br>Chang Ting Hsiang<br>Chang Tsai Kuang</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two</H2><P>Greetings in love to the beloved brother in the Lord,</P><P>Mr. Chang Kuang Jung:</P><P>It has been three months since we parted! Thank the Lord! In the days that have passed, the Lord's hand has upheld me and enabled me to stand firm. At times He has even used me to give a small testimony. Although I am very foolish, the Lord is happy to entrust me with a little of His messages here and there. Therefore, I dare not turn my back on the responsibility that the Lord has given me. I can only trust Him, on the one hand, while moving diligently forward, on the other. Brother, please pray earnestly for me because the work of the enemy is especially fierce both in my body and environment. There is no help for me other than from the Lord now. But the Lord's hand is eternally firm. Since He began the work, He will also finish it. Therefore, my heart is still at peace through faith.</P><P>Mr. Chang, I will now tell you some news about Wenchow. The meeting in Wenchow has had a lot of problems from the very beginning. It is a sad story. I am sure that you heard of it long ago, so I will not repeat it here. Thank the Lord! The dark clouds of the past have all passed away. Although man failed, God will never fail. Man can steal his way into the flock, but the Lord's sheep can discern the shepherd's voice from the stranger's. Therefore, beginning last spring, the brothers left the old Bible study place in Chu Kuan Lane and have rented another meeting place at Sha Mao Ho. The Lord really has given us a new beginning. About seventy percent of the ones who were in the old Bible study group did not come over. Although there are not many people, the condition is very pure. Now there are twenty people who break bread together, and they all love the Lord in one accord. On the fourteenth of last month, Brother Ts'ai Ch'i and I were led by the Lord to Wenchow to meet with them for eight days. In this meeting, we saw their zeal, piety, and love. It really moved our hearts. The worries the brothers had regarding the work in Wenchow can now be turned into praises.</P><P>We also thank the Lord that He has given us a co-worker in Wenchow. There is a brother named P'an Huo Ling who used to be a useful pastor in the China Inland Mission. In recent years he has read many of the publications put out by the Gospel Book Room, and he has been enlightened by the truth. He did not feel peace in his heart about being a hired pastor in the denominations, so he was willing to leave the denominations and follow the Lord to suffer outside the camp. His wife is very much in one accord. Now they have already moved out of the mission and are renting a house at 36 Hsing Kung Ti at T'ieh Ching Lan. Brother P'an completely relies on the Lord for his living. Please pray for this brother. Ask the Lord to bless his life and work so that he can glorify the Lord much. I will tell you the rest next time! Peace in the Lord.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Chen Chin Fa<br>May 4, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER TO ANNOUNCE A CONFERENCE OF "PURSUIT"</H2><P>Why are we, the church in Ning Hai, in such desolation? Why are the common believers so lacking in the growth in life? Why are the co-workers so weak and without the power of the Spirit in this work? Why are the meetings in every place so cold and scattered? It is because we understand only a little about our salvation. We only ask for peace and blessings for ourselves (both for now and in the future), but we have never taken up the cross to pursue that for which God has called us.</P><P>We now ask the Lord to give us a conference of "pursuit" from the sixth until the sixteenth of the sixth month of the Chinese calendar. We have invited a brother who is after the Lord's will and who has given up all for the Lord, David Hsu, to be at the meeting. He will lead us deeper into Christ. All the co-workers in the Lord and whoever has been regenerated and desires to pursue the truth may come to the conference.</P><P>The fifteenth day of the sixth month will be a time of baptism. Other matters, concerning bringing mosquito netting, bedding, and eating utensils, are the same as in years past, so I will not go into detail here. We hope that saints everywhere can pray much for this conference of pursuit. May the Lord give you peace in your way.</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Hua Shih Pin</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANNOUNCEMENT OF A CONFERENCE IN HANGCHOW,<br>CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>We ask all the brothers and sisters who meet in the Lord's name in all the localities to pray for the upcoming work of the Lord in Hangchow.</P><P>Some brothers who are in one accord awaiting the Lord's return feel deeply in prayer that what the church lacks today is not talent, method, or work but a revelation from the Holy Spirit, a spiritual living, and the cultivation of the truth. Therefore, the Father's center and the Lord's work should be the two testimonies that every person with life should know assuredly and should diligently practice. For this reason, in our prayer before the throne of the Father, we have decided to have an Overcomer Conference to support the brothers and sisters in the Lord. We hope to be able to have this conference in the fall of this year in Hangchow. We invite all the co-workers throughout China, those who walk in one accord in this way and who desire the truth, as well as all the brothers and sisters who pursue after the Lord's desire to come to the conference in Hangchow. Barring special hindrances, it will commence at the beginning of October. The conference will last about ten days: The first seven days will be only for preaching the central messages; the last three days will be for separate fellowship meetings among the brothers and the sisters. These fellowship meetings will resolve all kinds of spiritual difficulties and will emphasize the living of the members of the Lord's Body and their testimony of oneness. After the conference is over, perhaps there will be a few days of Bible study. The Bible study meeting is prepared especially for those brothers and sisters who desire to pursue the truth and please the Lord.</P><P>Brother Nee has already promised to bear the responsibility for the central messages of the Overcomer Conference. The rest of the meetings will perhaps be borne by other brothers or sisters. But we deeply know that we are weak and useless. If the Lord does not begin working first, we cannot do anything. For this reason, we ask all the brothers and sisters who care for the Lord's work to pray earnestly for this Overcomer Conference and for all the matters related to it. We only hope that our Father will be glorified in His church and in our Lord Jesus Christ! Amen! Peace in the Lord.</P><P>Your brother who is taking a pilgrimage in Hangchow,<br>Luan Hung Pin<br>July 4, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BRIEF NEWS FROM VARIOUS LOCALITIES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Northern Kiangsu</H2><P>The two brothers, Tsou Ts'ai Kao and Ts'ai Yun Hsien, who were incarcerated for suspicion of committing a crime, were found guilty of carelessness by the judge on May 18.

During this time, God really opened the door for preaching. Local ones have gradually been raised up. The ones who have improved the most and are the best are Mr. and Mrs. Ts'ao Tze Hsien. They are local people, and they are well respected in their social status, knowledge, and occupation. Their heart for pursuing the Lord is really admirable. There are also others who are very promising. Our brothers and sisters have received much help. They heard many spiritual things that they never heard before, and we have been supplied with much food in life. Our brother is really a good mother.</P><P>Brother Chang went out once last Thursday. The day after he came back, he was not feeling very well. He had very bad diarrhea. He could not eat or drink for two days, so he became physically weak and could not get out of bed. Although he tried many cures, he was still not fully restored. Brother Chang wanted very much to return to Shanghai for rest. We did not want to let him go! But Brother Chang was determined to go home so we reluctantly let him return to Shanghai. In considering how he left, I am ashamed that I did not know how to serve him better. Although I have a home, we could not care for him or cure him. Therefore, I felt it was my fault that he was so desperate to return home. A very healthy Brother Chang came to Tsinan and a very sick Brother Chang returned to Shanghai. The brothers and sisters in Shanghai may blame us! Please forgive us. After Brother Chang returns to Shanghai, he will still need to rest. I can tell him the results of the tests on his stool sample later, as well as how he should take care of himself.</P><P>Brother Chang's departure will surely affect the work in Tsinan. The work has not been fully concluded. There are several brothers who need a little more help to make that last step; they have not come to the meetings yet. The work is more than half done, but there is still a small portion left to finish. This is really too bad. May the Lord accomplish what is left through His other servant. We hope that Brother Chang can come to Tsinan again when he has recovered from his illness. The door of our meeting and the brothers' and sisters' hearts are open and waiting for him to return to Tsinan. We ask the Lord to send him again to do the work He entrusted to him.</P><P>Brother Nee, how is your health lately? We heard the news that you also were physically weak. We pray constantly that God will give you a healthy body to finish His work. We also hope that the day will come when we can leave this body of sickness. May the Lord bless you!</P><P>Brother Chou Hsin Yi is doing very well in Tsinan. The brothers are very close to him. We also worry about his health. I will not write more. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Ch'ien Neng Sheng<br>June 28</P><P>The meeting in Tsinan:<br>Responsible brothers: P'an Hui Sheng, Ts'ai Chih Wen<br>Meeting address: We have already moved to 13-7 Kuang Chih Yuan Street, Tsinan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTERS FROM HANGCHOW, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One</H2><P>To Brother Yueh Chiao and the brothers in Shanghai:</P><P>I am very peaceful in Hangchow. I am well in body, soul, and spirit. The brothers in Hangchow are all lovable in the sight of the Lord. Everything among the brothers is peaceful, although there is some persecution from the outside. Inwardly, there is no crack to be seen. "Filled with peace" can be used to describe the meeting in Hangchow. I have been helped by the brothers very much here. How could someone as weak and ignorant as myself help the brothers in Hangchow? But if I can receive some help from them, then I have not come in vain. My work is to fellowship more with the newly saved brothers, and sometimes there is a mutual exhortation among the brothers who walk in the same way. Finally, I want to ask you a favor; your little brother who is so weak and ignorant needs your prayers more than ever, so that I will not shame the Lord's name and so that I can serve them faithfully. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Huang Tsai Ch'ing</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two</H2><P>Dear Brother Ho:</P><P>You must be very busy now because the work in the Gospel Book Room has increased. But I know that you are not for yourself but for the Lord and the brothers. So I think you must be doing this laborious work very happily. May the Father provide you everything.</P><P>Brother Chang Kuang Jung is here and has a Bible study every evening concerning the matter of the church because the brothers in Hangchow need this kind of help now. May the Father bless this work so that the brothers will express the church life more.</P><P>With respect to the work here, I have been praying some before the Lord. As to the rest, I have left everything to the Lord's leading. However, in the past few days my flesh has been too active. When I have contacted people, I have not followed the leading of the Holy Spirit and have often acted according to the flesh. I have already repented for this sin before God. May God have mercy on me and give me the grace to stand in the place of death every day so that I will only act by the Holy Spirit. I bless you with peace in the Lord! Greet Brothers Witness Lee, Shen Ting Ling, and Chin T'ang for me.</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Tsai Ch'ing</P><P>The meeting in Hangchow:<br>Responsible brothers: Chiu Chung Man, Ma Ti Sheng<br>Meeting address: 321 Tung Chieh Road, Hangchow</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTERS FROM CH'I HSIEN CH'IAO, P'U TUNG,<br>EAST OF SHANGHAI</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One</H2><P>To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Watchman!</P><P>I have heard how you do not care for your life in your laboring for the Lord and that you have gotten sick. How have you been recently? I think of you often. I have been blessed by the Lord to leave the denominations which are condemned by God. According to my capacity in spiritual life and knowledge and the strength of my living, I would never dare to obey the Lord and leave the denominational way. But my heart would not have been peaceful if I had not left; therefore, I put all considerations aside and left the denominations.</P><P>The brothers and sisters are all well. Please do not worry about us. Their spiritual life, knowledge, and strength are all weak, but their desire is for the Lord. Now they are even more clear that the divisions in the denominations are of the flesh and are hated by the Lord. Although the number in our meetings is one third less than it was before we left the denominations, in the past five months, the amount of willing gifts in the offering box is already more than we received in a whole year prior to leaving the denomination.</P><P>This week we have more than ten brothers and sisters who will be baptized. We will also have a conference for several days. Please pray for it.</P><P>Some in the denominations oppose the fact that we do not allow women to pray or preach when there are both men and women in the congregation. They also oppose the matter of head covering. They use 1 Corinthians 11:5, "But every woman praying or prophesying..," and verse 15, "..because her long hair has been given to her for a covering," as a basis for their opposition. They think that it is all right for women to pray and preach in a congregation of both men and women. They also think that the woman's covering of long hair can be counted as a head covering.</P><P>I answered that 1 Corinthians 11:5 refers to a meeting of women where the sisters can pray or preach. Even then they still must cover their heads. If they do not, it is against the commandments in 1 Timothy 2:12 and 1 Corinthians 14:34-35. I also answered that believing women should not only cover their heads with long hair, but in a public meeting they should put on head coverings. First Corinthians 11:2-16 refers to what the sisters should do: (1) They cannot cut their hair or shave their heads (vv. 6, 15a); (2) they should cover their heads (vv. 6, 13); and (3) they should be in a position of submission (vv. 8-10). If a sister acts according to what the Bible says, she will gain more of the Lord's blessing and reward. I do not have enough Bible knowledge; I do not know if my answer to them was wrong or not. Please instruct me in Collection of Newsletters. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your weak brother,<br>Chu En Sheng<br>June 16, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Answer</H2><P>Your answer is according to the teachings of the Bible. However, the word in 1 Timothy 2:12 is "teach" in the original Greek. It means to teach as a teacher. God does not allow sisters to do this. The word in 1 Corinthians 11:4-5 is "prophesy" in the original Greek. God allows sisters to do this (Acts 21:9). First Corinthians 14:35 mentions "speaking in the church," which is in the meeting of the church (of course, there are brothers there). God does not allow sisters to do this either. Therefore, in these three passages of the Bible, we see that a sister (1) cannot teach as a teacher or define doctrines, either in public or in private, (2) can prophesy, but (3) cannot speak in the church meetings no matter whether it is a teaching or a prophesying.</P><P>Long hair is God's natural sign to remind the woman to submit to authority and not be the head. Head covering is an outward sign that the woman submits to authority. Long hair manifests God's ordination for woman (so it is a woman's glory); head covering manifests a woman's submission to God (so it can be called a woman's beauty). (Oh, God has such an ordination for woman that He would use her to manifest His wisdom. She is so glorious! It is so beautiful when she obeys God's ordination!) Long hair is a declaration that speaks forth God's ordination for woman; head covering is an amen that women respond to God. If a woman does not cover her head, she does not obey God's ordination. If a woman cuts her hair or shaves her head, she overthrows God's ordination. Therefore, a sister should (1) not shave her head or cut her hair; rather, she should allow her hair to grow long to exhibit God's ordination for woman in the natural realm, and (2) cover her head to express her obedience to God's ordination by her actions&mdash;Editor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two</H2><P>To my dear brother in the Lord, Shih Chiu Jung:</P><P>I think you have already received my answer last week. I have not received the seventh issue of Collection of Newsletters to date. Our locality had an eight-day conference from the twenty-second to the twenty-ninth of this month during a break in the farming work. In this conference, we preached two principles: (1) the emphasis in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and 24 of the salvation of the believer's soul and its relationship to the Lord's return, and (2) only those moved by the Holy Spirit and who realize the Father's love will bear the fruits of repentance, receive salvation, and bear spiritual fruit. By the Lord's blessing, both messages edified the spiritual life of the brothers and sisters. By the Lord's special grace, six brothers and eight sisters were baptized into the Lord's name during this conference. There are still a few who will be baptized in a few days. Please greet the brothers and sisters for me. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your little brother who is in the same way in the Lord,<br>Chu En Sheng<br>July 30, 1934</P><P>Mailing address: 112 Ch'i Hsien Ch'iao, P'u Tung, Shanghai</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM TA CH'IAO, HUAI AN,<br>NORTHERN KIANGSU</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters who have received the heavenly calling with us:</P><P>We few country farmers have been saved for six or seven years. We confess that in the past we disgraced the Lord's grace and buried the Lord's glory. Recently, the Lord has expressed the power of His cross in our environment and has used His miraculous ways to save quite a few people. We cannot cover up the Lord's glory any longer. We have written the history of our meeting and its present condition so that the Lord's name may be praised.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>How the Meeting in Ta Ch'aio Began</H2><P>Ta Ch'iao is a small town in the northwest region of Huai An County about sixty miles from the city. We began meeting there in Mr. Ting Keng Fu's house. Mr. Ting's name is Yi Yuan. He was a Presbyterian preacher. Later, he quit his preaching post as a result of a message by Chi Yung Tung concerning leaving the denominations. He gathered us together to his house to meet in the Lord's name. We began meeting in December of 1928, but we did not establish the Lord's table until October of 1929. There were only three brothers and four sisters who broke bread together to remember the Lord at the time. The first years were very peaceful.</P><P>Then all of a sudden, Mr. Ting's house was flooded. In the flood of July 1931, Mr. Ting's house was washed away by the water, and his whole family moved, so our meetings stopped for more than four months. Later, we received the Lord's gift and rebuilt the house, so our meetings resumed.</P><P>Unfortunately, problems came again not long after. Mr. Ting's house was repossessed by the landowner. At the end of 1932, he tore down his house and rebuilt it in Chang Chia Chuang, more than twenty miles from us. We moved our meeting place to Brother Hsin Ling's house and continued to break bread in remembrance of the Lord. Although our meeting had met with difficulties several times and our numbers were small, the Lord never dropped us. He continued to keep us on His ground. This is how our meeting was started. Now we mention something of the Lord's work among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>How the Lord Has Worked in Ta Ch'iao<br>and the Present Condition of the Work</H2><P>When the meeting in Ta Ch'iao began, there was an old brother, Mr. Shan Hsia Ch'ang, who was from So Chia Chi, Fu Ning. He was a teacher in Mr. Ting's house. In his spare time, he went out to preach the gospel. The Lord confirmed His work with miracles and the casting out of demons. Just as Mark 16:20 says, when the disciples preach the gospel, the Lord works with them and confirms the word by miracles. The news of this spread all over the neighboring towns, and many sick people came for healing by the Lord. Many sick ones were healed, and a few sinners were saved. Unfortunately, we and Mr. Ting did not understand the nature of God's work; therefore, when many sick ones came, we refused and even criticized them by saying that believing in Jesus for the sake of healing is not proper. We did not realize that the Lord was manifested to destroy the work of the devil. When we failed to express the Lord, His work stopped. Only recently has the work been revived.</P><P>Mr. Ting moved to Chang Chia Chuang in 1932. He came back to Ta Ch'iao in 1933. He began by renting a house to live in and then rented land and began building a five room house. Now we are still meeting in Mr. Ting's house. However, these few rooms are only sufficient for Mr. Ting's family, and it can barely accommodate the meeting. We have already given this matter to the Lord and have prayed for some time before the Lord concerning this matter. We also ask the brothers and sisters to pray for us to see when the Lord will make provision for the accomplishment of His work.</P><P>In January of this year, Mr. Ting returned from Shanghai and told us that in the past not only our gospel work was contrary to the will of God but even our prayer was not according to God's will. He said that in Shanghai he had heard Mr. Nee say God had an eternal plan before the foundation of the world. All creation and man are for the purpose of expressing the glory of His Son so that His Son can be the center and Head of all things. The Lord Jesus died on the cross to resolve God's problems and accomplish God's plan. The redeemed ones must be united with Christ to deal with the rebellious Satan. All our work and prayer must be according to this desire. In this way, we can become people after God's heart like David and Samuel. We can walk with God like Enoch. Upon hearing this word, we changed our prayer. We never expected it, but in a little more than half a month, the Lord's work revived and was recovered to the first condition. We used to have only a few people in our meetings; now we have more than thirty. On the twenty-eighth of last month (June), three brothers, Lu Tsai Chih, Lu An Pang, and Ting Ai Chu, and six sisters were baptized. Now there are a total of nineteen brothers and sisters in our table meeting. Although Mr. Ting often works in other localities, we still thank the Lord. In addition, Messrs. Chiu and Chi, Mr. Feng Hsien Chih, and Mr. Chu Huai Nan have come among us to help us go on.</P><P>Our hope now is that the Lord will return soon. We also hope that the brothers and sisters who love us will pray for us and help us weak and little ones stand firm so that we do not shame the Lord's name. Peace to the brothers and sisters in the Lord!</P><P>Your little brothers,<br>Lee Hsin Ling, Lee Yu Kao, Yang Shih Huai<br>July 14</P><P>Mailing address: c/o Mr. Chi Yung Tung, Su Chia Tsueh, northern Kiangsu</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM YIN HAN CHUANG, HUAI AN,<br>NORTHERN KIANGSU</H2><P>Peace to Brother Yueh Chiao:</P><P>I have received all the copies of Notes on Scriptural Messages, Collection of Newsletters and The Glad Tidings. I have also received your letter explaining why you did not send the issue of The Present Testimony (No. 32). It is truly the love of Christ that you did not feel bothered to do this even though you are very busy! Thank you, and thank you again!</P><P>In April I wrote a letter to the brothers telling them that the number of people meeting on the Lord's Day was around thirty and that our meeting place was in a sister's house. Thank the Lord for His marvelous grace. He did a special work in the hot summer and saved several people out of the authority of darkness. Now we have increased to fifty people, and the meeting place has moved to a three-room house I built when I returned here last year. We moved three Lord's Days ago. The Lord's table has increased by four sisters: Mrs. Yin, from the Presbyterian Church (baptized by sprinkling); Mrs. T'ang, from the China Inland Mission (baptized by immersion); and Miss Yin and Mrs. Ku who are newly regenerated through the truth. They were baptized together after the table meeting on the fifteenth of this month. The Lord willing, there will be others who are willing to be buried with Him. Please do not forget to pray for this.</P><P>There is one more thing we would ask the brothers and sisters who have fellowship with us in all the localities to especially pray for. It is the Lord's work. Thank the Lord, He has raised up workers in northern Kiangsu to work for Him. But the environment has hindered us, and we have been unable to do a proper work for the Lord. We were able to do something only at the end of the third month in 1932 when Brother Ting Yi Yuan came from Chang Chia Ao to work with us for three days. The rest of the time Brother Chou Pu Ch'ien and useless I have done some scattered work. Now the Lord has placed Brother Chang in Chang Chia Ao and has placed me, the very immature one, in Yin Han Chuang. I am still very ignorant of the truth of the church. Thank the Lord, He opened His channel of life at Wen-teh Lane in Shanghai, so that His water of life can flow livingly to every place to irrigate His fields and water His crops. We ask the Lord's glorious light to protect the co-laboring brothers and sisters there until His second coming and to rapture us before the tribulation. Amen.

Thank the Lord that he has rendered us much help in our fellowship. Now we have decided with him that we will have a few days of prayer first to see how the Lord leads. Perhaps the Lord will have work that He wants him to do. We especially ask the brothers and sisters in Shanghai to remember the Lord's work in Chefoo in their prayers and to remember His faithful servant (especially his health).</P><P>We have already sent a letter to Brother Chang Chen Ming in Dairen and invited him to come to Chefoo with Brothers Chiang Ch'uan Ch'ing and Chang Wen Wei. We also sent a letter to Brother Wang Hsin Wen in Mou Ping inviting him to the meeting.</P><P>We ask the Lord to give grace to the brothers in Chefoo so that we can be revived.</P><P>Brother Chang Tze Chieh has also come to Chefoo to meet with us. We have also seen the importance of the work in Tsingtao, and we pray often for the work in East Tsingtao. Thank the Lord, Brother Chang has come. Perhaps the Lord will want him to go to Tsingtao. Please pray much for this matter. Because he has many friends in Tsingtao, it will be easier for him to work there. We will see how the Lord leads him after the meeting is over. It is very marvelous that the Lord does not want to bring him alone to Tsingtao. The Lord sent him to Chefoo first to fellowship with the brothers and then from there to Tsingtao (the flow of the work). Please pray for this matter. May the Lord revive His work. Amen.</P><P>From,<br>Lee P'ei Ling, Chao Pi Chen</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two</H2><P>Greetings to Brother Witness:</P><P>I arrived safely in Chefoo eight days ago. Everything has been peacefully under the covering of the Father. Please do not worry!</P><P>Mr. T'ien P'ing Fang and Miss An from Ch'ang-ch'un and Brother Chang Tze Chieh and the rest from P'ing Tu have already arrived in Chefoo. I hear that Mr. T'ien Hsin Wu and Brother Chang Chen Ming from Dairen and the brothers from Tsingtao will be arriving soon. If the Lord is willing, we hope to have a few days of conference meetings beginning next Lord's Day. Please remember this conference before the throne of grace because if the Lord does not begin His good work first, we cannot do anything. We ask the Father God to not only save people in these few days of meetings but also to gain some for the Lord.</P><P>For the past few days, I have had four meetings with all the brothers and sisters in addition to talking to the brothers individually. In these four meetings, I really saw how lovable the brothers in Chefoo are.</P><P>Did Mr. Chang go to Hangchow? Have you received a letter from Brother Nee? How is your health? I am concerned about all these matters. If you have time, please let me know to comfort my heart. All the members of your family are healthy. Both Brothers Lee and Chao handle the responsibility for all aspects of the meeting well. My living quarters and food are very adequate also. Please do not worry about anything! I greet you with this. Peace in the Lord!

We pray that His powerful hand will come down from heaven to be with him. May the Lord prevent the hand of the enemy from working on him. Amen.</P><P>I have heard that Brother Ching Ch'ing will go to Tsingtao to work. Please let me know the details. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>May you have God's grace and peace, the presence of the Lord Jesus, and the leading of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</P><P>Your younger brother,<br>Ch'ang En<br>August 1</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Four</H2><P>Greetings to my brother Hsi Ling:</P><P>I was very happy to receive your letter. I felt very bad about mentioning the work in Tsingtao. I arrived in Tsingtao at the end of last year, and I could not stay for very long because the Chinese New Year was approaching, so I had to rush home. When I was in the meeting in Shanghai, I was not very clear about the matter of being called. Brother Nee also mentioned the conditions and principles for the work. I suddenly realized my previous failures. In the past my work was really "disjointed" and did not have Christ as its center. I felt very ashamed before the Lord and dared not move hastily. I have decided not to be a co-worker in the formal sense. Since returning home, I have been sick much and have had many frustrations (I wrote Brother Nee once and mentioned it to him). My coming to stay in Chefoo has definitely been with the Lord's leading. As for the work in Tsingtao, I can only pray for it much in my prayers. The Lord willing, I can go and see a little. I dare not decide yet if I will go or not. The matter of going to Tsingtao occupies a great place in my heart and has become a serious issue to me. Now I am dealing with the Lord about this matter. If I can go to Tsingtao, I will definitely let the brothers know. But in the matter of the work (preaching), if I put it aside, it seems to be a case of stubbornness and hard-heartedness on my part. Please pray much for this matter. May the Lord cause us to walk in His will, so the whips and rods of discipline do not come upon us. May the Lord bless your way with grace!</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Chang Tze Chieh<br>July 20</P><P>Greet Brothers Nee, Lee Teh Hsiu, and Witness Lee.

Time really flies. This has caused us to really count our days. We want to glorify God more in the time remaining. Amen.</P><P>Miss An's telegram arrived at my place around noon today. I discovered that you had already arrived in Chefoo. There is an elderly brother from Ch'ang-ch'un, Brother T'ien P'ing Fang, who is at the meetings there with you. I hope you can give him much help. Moreover, I hope you can take a trip through Manchuria because there is a desperate need for laborers to come here and work. You can find out about our condition by talking to Senior Brother T'ien. I hope you will remember the work here often. Time is running out. We can discuss this later!

We really thank and praise our Father and our Lord Christ because He has had mercy on us and cared for us in these last times. He has opened a door for us in every place to preach His messages and revive His children to return to His name. In addition to hastily sending Senior Brother T'ien P'ing Fang and my sister to Chefoo, we constantly remember the conference in Chefoo before the throne of grace. We ask the Lord to grace and bless His work and help you be filled with the power of the Holy Spirit to be a bright testimony for the Lord. We also ask the Lord to grace the unsaved sinners in Chefoo so that they would come to the Lord's cross and be enlightened. Amen.</P><P>Brother T'ien P'ing Fang can tell you of the news from our area. It has been raining every day for many days, and the water levels have risen very high everywhere. As a result, I have not been able to communicate with Ch'ang-ch'un for half a month. Brother Chiang Shun T'ien can usually come on Wednesday and the Lord's Day. Now there are three brothers who have been baptized into the Lord's name. When Brother Chiang comes, there are more brothers and sisters who want to be baptized. Since the Lord has opened a door for us, we believe that no man can shut it. Furthermore, there is a desperate need for the truth in Manchuria. Because the people here have been under the denominational system for a long time, they still are attracted by the activities in the denominations, even though they have obeyed the Lord and turned to Him. It is like the children of Israel longing for Egypt in the wilderness. Therefore, we beg the Lord to keep us and grace us by sending some brothers to help us. Since you have already come to Chefoo, it would only be another day and a night's journey to Ch'ang-ch'un. I beg the Lord's Spirit to lead you here. This is something we have earnestly hoped for for a long time. It would not delay you to come to Manchuria once. The Overcomer Conference in Hangchow is in the fall. May the Lord perfect us according to His will. Amen.</P><P>May the Lord bless your work in Chefoo and give you much power in the Holy Spirit and keep you healthy. I also hope that the brothers and sisters in Chefoo receive much grace from the Lord this time and are revived to become the Lord's overcomers. Amen. Please greet Brother Sun, Brother Chao, Brother Lin, and all the brothers and sisters in the Lord with peace!</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>An Ching T'ien<br>July 23</P><P>Mailing Address: Yu Min Hospital, Chu Chia Cheng Tze, Ch'ang-ch'un</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM DAIREN, MANCHURIA</H2><P>To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Yueh Chiao:</P><P>Although we have never met, I have known you for a long time in the Lord. Thank the Lord, when I had no way out, He showed me the right way. But while I was about to obey, as Hymn #68 in the Little Flock Hymnal says in stanza two, "Satan undermine[d] the way." As a consequence, the meeting in Dairen stopped for a long time. Because of this we were weak in life, and sometimes we fellowshipped with the brothers and sisters in the denominations. But we could never gain what we wanted in our innermost parts. As for myself, I just read the Bible in a sloppy way. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>We are so weak, how will we be able to do what we want to do? I myself know that I have not been baptized (I was baptized five years ago by sprinkling in the Lutheran Church. Two years ago, I debated strongly with the obedient brothers in Chefoo, and I even ridiculed them concerning the doctrine of baptism by immersion after sprinkling. I thought I held the proper truth. I was so very proud!) My name is still on the books of a denomination (in Pei Sui Hua County, Harbin). I know that I should inform them of my desire to leave as a testimony that I am renouncing the sin of denominations. These are two testimonies before man that cannot be compromised in expressing one's obedience. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>I hope all the brothers and sisters earnestly pray for us and ask the Lord to revive us. I respectfully greet you and Brother Witness Lee, whom I saw in Chefoo, and all the brothers and sisters.</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>Chiang Ch'un Ching</P><P>Mailing address: Holiness School, Jih Chi Ting, Dairen</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Additional Suggestion</H2><P>In Collection of Newsletters, the specific addresses of the different localities are not clearly provided. It is difficult for me to send a letter to Brother Yuan Chin Chou of Ling Tzu, to Chefoo, or to someplace else. (I have not received a letter from them for a long time.) I sometimes pass through Ch'ang-ch'un, but I do not know Brother Chiang Shun T'ien's address. How can I visit the church there? What is more, if I see a letter in Collection of Newsletters from a brother or sister in trials, how can I send a letter to comfort them? Would it be possible to put the specific mailing address after every letter, to facilitate communication between the brothers and sisters?

Peace in the Lord!</P><P>From,<br>Hung<br>June 5</P><P>The Meeting in Kuang Jau, Shantung:<br>Responsible Brother: Nieh Tao Hung<br>Mailing Address: c/o Hsi Men Li T'ien Yi Hsin Hao, Kuang Jau, Shantung</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Letter from Brother Yuan Chin Chou</H2><P>Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>We praise and thank the Lord because He has called some to meet in His name in Hsi Mao Wang Chuang which is to the northeast (ten miles) of the Kuang Jau county seat. They meet as obedient children and have become holy. God has truly manifested His own works of power. When a sinner repents, the angels in heaven rejoice. How much more should we rejoice when some believers repent and become obedient children!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Beginning of their Table Meeting<br>in the Lord's Name</H2><P>The table meeting in Hsi Mao Wang Chuang of Kuang Jau began on May 28, 1934 (the Lord's Day). A few days before that Lord's Day, a Mr. Nieh Jen Yi heard the word of the truth, the gospel of salvation, and believed that Jesus was the Son of God and the unique Savior. He also heard about baptism and obeyed the commandment of the Lord. On that Lord's Day, he was baptized in the Tzu River (seven miles from here) at 10:00 in the morning. In the evening we had a Lord's table meeting. There were two brothers, Nieh Tao Hung and Nieh Jen Yi, and four sisters and myself in attendance. Altogether there were seven people meeting together in harmony. We happily met, fellowshipped with each other, broke the bread, and prayed to remember the Lord and to praise God's greatness!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Origin of their Meeting<br>and Present Condition</H2><P>This area has been under the Presbyterian denomination for many years. The brothers and sisters usually meet in Brother Nieh Tao Hung's house. On the Lord's Day there are sometimes people from other villages in the meetings. There are usually about twenty people with more women than men. They have now rented two simple buildings specifically for meetings in the Lord's name. The chairs, tables, and other furnishings have all been borrowed (from the believers' homes). All the expenses come out of the newly established offering box. The two responsible brothers are the two Niehs.</P><P>More than half of them cannot read, so they have a problem reading the Bible. Now they hope and ask the Lord to enable them to read the thousand-character gospel lessons and Bible Studies for Beginners. But there is no one to take the responsibility. Please pray for them concerning this matter.</P><P>There is another matter that has come up recently. There are four people who have life and are willing to obey the Lord and be baptized, but their father will not allow it. He has hindered them by saying, "It is all right if you get baptized at home by sprinkling, but you cannot get baptized by immersion outside the home. The river is too far, and there are too many people watching. Even if you are not ashamed, I am ashamed for you! What is more, in this area no one has seen anyone go into the water like this. I am afraid you will be in danger of swallowing too much water!" Please give them some advice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Recent Opposition from Outsiders</H2><P>Their actions have attracted the attention and opposition of many people in the denominations! They look on them as ones who create confusion and who have been carried off by the winds of heresy and the deceptions of Satan. Therefore, they reject them. Even though they are meeting with this kind of opposition, the brothers and sisters are able to stand firm by the overcoming Lord. May the brothers and sisters who faithfully love the Lord pray before the Lord for the meeting in Kuang Jau's Hsi Mao Wang Chuang and ask the Lord to keep them until He comes. Amen. Peace to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord!</P><P>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br>Yuan Chin Chou<br>Mailing Address: 30 Nan Kuan, Ling Tzu, Shantung</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Additional Letter Written<br>by the Brothers and Sisters of Kuang Jau<br>to Leave the Denominations</H2><P>Greetings to the director of the Kuang Jau<br>Christian Presbyterian Church:</P><P>The Bible is the standard for the beliefs and practices of Christians. All decisions about the faith should have the Bible as the highest court of appeals. After carefully studying the matter of denominations, we have found that it is not only not in the Bible, but it is also forbidden by the Bible, because Christ is not divided (1 Cor. 1:10-13; Gal. 5:20). The Lord Jesus prayed, "Keep them..that they may be one" (John 17:11). The word in Acts 15:14 says, "To take out from them a people for His name." Second Corinthians 6:14-18 commands the believers to separate themselves from the unbelievers. It does not command the believers to separate themselves from other believers. The Bible forbids divisions of the Body (1 Cor. 12:25). For this reason, we will not confess to being the member of any denomination from now on in order to obey God's Word and to keep the oneness among all the children of God. We will only confess that we are Christians, and we will meet in the Lord's name according to the Bible. We will fellowship with all the children of God according to the regenerated life. We do this, not as a matter of personal affection, but to leave the denominational names. We are not leaving the brothers and sisters in the Lord. When we meet, we are still friends. In conclusion, those in the denominations are not unsaved, but the Bible says that believers cannot denominate themselves. We are not leaving the denominations in a hasty way. We have spent much time in study before taking this step. We are explaining our action to you with this letter. We greet you.</P><P>Sincerely,<br>Nieh Tao Hung, Nieh Tao Sheng, Nieh Fu Sheng,<br>Nieh Yun Chi, Nieh Cheng En<br>July 17, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM THE MEETING IN KU T'IEN,<br>FUKIEN PROVINCE</H2><P>To Brother Ho, whom I do not forget before the Lord:</P><P>I received the card and the bundle of tracts. Thank you. I also received the Bible and other books a few days ago. I think you must have already received my letter of response. Our meeting (the Lord's table) began on July 8 (a Lord's Day), and our gospel meeting did not begin until July 15. Only thirty to forty came to our gospel meeting this time because the rain hindered some. Most of those who came were from the various denominations. There were also many students. We now have the prayer meeting on Wednesday afternoons at 4:00. There is a children's meeting at 9:00 Saturday morning. On the Lord's Day, the table meeting is at 9:00 in the morning, and the gospel meeting is at 3:00 in the afternoon. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>When I first arrived in Ku T'ien, I went and testified in the four denominational schools and one chapel here. At that time, I only preached salvation and expounded on the various aspects of salvation. Therefore, they were all very happy to come to my meetings. Even the pastors in the denominations did not oppose much. But now they have begun to attack. They are afraid that their members will leave them because we have begun to meet separately. Therefore, every Lord's Day, they preach against us. We preach salvation by faith, so they preach salvation by works based on James 2. Thank the Lord, there are quite a few people in each school who understand salvation by faith. Even many who are not saved know that salvation is by faith. After the pastor began preaching this way, many people began to worry that he was not yet saved. On June 30, I baptized some brothers, and the pastor began to preach that baptism was a ritual and said that we were the Baptist Church. When the brothers and sisters did not go to his chapel to worship, he preached Luke 4:16 on Sunday to rebuke us. He said we did not follow the Lord Jesus in going into the synagogue according to custom. The enemy is setting traps to hinder us, but we know that the foolishness of those who oppose the truth will be exposed (2 Tim. 3:8-9).</P><P>The house which the Lord prepared for us is also very marvelous. Originally this house was rented to someone else. The brothers all felt that this house was good because (1) it is separate from other houses, and there are no houses connected to it, and (2) it is in a good, quiet, central location. For this reason we begged the Lord strongly. Later, the Lord accomplished it for us. The Lord also prepared everything that we need in the meetings now.</P><P>Brother Chung left us yesterday to return to Foochow because he received a telegram from his family. Our hearts were very sad. At this time the number of our co-workers should have increased instead of decreased. However, this is the Lord's arrangement, and we should also praise the Lord. Our hymn is #61.</P><P>Now only Brother Wei and myself are living in the room next to the meeting place. If the Lord is willing, we would also like to study Bible Studies for Beginners for those who desire the Word, but we do not know the Lord's time. If we wait until the schools are in session, we think we can also help more than a few dozen students. We have begun to pray for this matter now. Brothers, if you feel a burden before the Lord, please do not forget to pray for all these matters. I believe the strength of the work depends completely on your prayer and ours. If Brother Shen, Brother Witness Lee, Brother Lee Teh Hsiu, Brother Fu Feng Yen, Brother Tai En Chao, or Brother Sun Hung En want to know about the condition of Ku T'ien and want to bear the burden in prayer, please show them this letter.</P><P>Brother, you know that the most difficult thing to deal with is the people who have joined us from all the denominations. We must first tear down before we can build up. Most of what fills their brains is not the truth. At present there are many questions before us that need our explanation. If the Lord Himself does not do it, there is really no way. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>Brother, I do not have time to tell you everything in detail. I will tell you later if I have the chance. I bless you with victory. Greetings to the brothers!</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Pi Yin<br>July 18, 1934</P><P>Mailing Address: 1 Er Pao Hou Alley, Ku T'ien, Fukien</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM HUA SHE, SHAOHSING,<br>CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>Greetings to the brothers and sisters who meet<br>in the Lord's name in every place:</P><P>Through the publication Collection of Newsletters your brothers in Hua She have come to know how God uses His faithful servants to work in every place. We cannot refrain from giving glory to our Father. We weak, little ones have received much help from Collection of Newsletters, but we also feel very ashamed because we have seen that we are very immature in many areas.</P><P>Nevertheless, we still believe that all things work together for good to those who love God. For this reason, we have written the following to briefly explain the origin of the meeting in our locality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Period of Confusion</H2><P>There were about twenty different branches of the Hangchow Ch'ing T'ai Men Chinese Independent Inland Mission. Each branch was independent in each locality. Hua She was one of those localities. The number of those who confessed their faith outwardly was over one hundred. However, they were all confused and not clear about the matter of salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Period of Light</H2><P>After Brother Hu Chi T'ang went to Shanghai to work in the silk brocade business, he received clear salvation from God's servant. Every time he returned to Hua She, he would preach salvation to us causing us to become clearer step by step.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Period of Pursuit</H2><P>After we understood salvation, we knew that we were nothing but babes. We spontaneously desired the pure milk of the word. Brothers Shan Kai Fen and Hu Chi Fu attended the conference in Shanghai in 1931.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Period of Transition</H2><P>God released the truth concerning the church in the 1931 conference in Shanghai. Brothers Shan and Hu knew that they should not remain in the denominations. After returning to Hua She, they withdrew their names from the denomination and resigned from their positions as board members and treasurer of the church. At that time, the Seventh-day Adventists were working in Hua She, so the members of the Inland Mission were in turmoil. If Brothers Shan and Hu met some place else, many people would not know what to do. For this reason, many faithful ones invited Brothers Shan and Hu to conduct meetings in their denominations. The goal was to strengthen and exhort them and to wait for the time (God's time) to move.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Period of Practice</H2><P>After the truth of the church was preached in Hua She, it was several months before it was put into practice. Finally, Brother Watchman Nee came to Hua She on March 4, 1933. In a fellowship meeting, he clearly solved many difficult problems in the Bible, and many people were satisfied. A few days later, the entire congregation decided to leave the denominations. On April 2, we began to practice meeting in the Lord's name.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Preaching Meetings</H2><P>Every Lord's Day we preach the gospel at 9:00 in the morning and 2:00 in the afternoon. There is a edifying meeting at 10:30 in the morning.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Lord's Table Meeting</H2><P>At first we had the table meeting at 7:30 in the evening because we were afraid that unsaved ones would be mixed in with us. At that time, there were at most seventeen or eighteen and sometimes only four or five people because of the distance (most of the people live three miles outside of Hua She) and the weather (storms, heat, or cold). On June 24 of this year, we changed the meeting time to 8:30 in the morning for the convenience of the brothers who live far away. We meet in Brother Hu's house in order to avoid disturbance. The number in the meeting is usually about twenty. If all those who break bread come at once, there are more than thirty. Furthermore, there are still twenty to thirty people who are saved but have not yet broken bread with us. The immaturity of our spiritual life is sufficiently demonstrated by this condition. We ask and hope the brothers and sisters in each locality will pray for us.</P><p>Your brothers,<br>Hu Chi Fu, Yang En Fu, Shen Yung Tao</p><P>Mailing Address: c/o Mr. Hu Chi Fu, Hua She, Shaohsing, Chekiang</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM NING HAI, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>To my brother in the Lord, Brother Yueh Chiao:</P><P>May the Lord preserve you brothers in Shanghai in peace and may your bodies and spirits remain healthy in this very hot summer.</P><P>The meeting in Ning Hai held a ten-day training for the workers from July 18 to July 28. Many believers came from all the localities to attend the training. Brother David Hsu was led by the Lord to come bear the responsibility for the meetings. In the mornings he spoke about how Christ is the Head over all things and about the position of the overcomers. In the evenings, he preached the gospel to sinners. In the afternoons, we discussed the truth concerning the church. We really praise the Lord because He gave a good testimony through Brother Hsu and drew many people to the truth.</P><P>Some among us have already written a letter corporately to the China Inland Mission requesting that they allow us to meet freely in the Lord's name. The only relationship we will have with them is our relationship in the Lord, nothing else. If they do not concede, a small number of us will leave. As for the other matters, we do them one by one as we receive the light. The most difficult point is how to discern those who still have doubts concerning the matter of salvation. This matter requires the prayer of the brothers.</P><P>Brother Hsu is still here now. I exhorted him to rest several days before leaving.</P><P>Is Brother Nee in Shanghai? Have Brother Chang Kuang Jung and Brother Chou Hsin Yi returned from Tsinan? Please greet them for me. (Parts omitted.) I bless you with peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your brother,<br>Hua Shih Pin<br>July 2</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTERS FROM P'U MEN, P'ING YANG,<br>CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>One</H2><P>Peace to our dear brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee:</P><P>The churches in the P'u Men countryside have received grace from God to gain the truth. There are already five meetings in the Lord's name here. (Brother Wang Yu T'ing has already published their condition in Collection of Newsletters, so we will not waste time repeating.) However, we are spiritually immature and recently have had a feeling in the light that there should be a conference here. The location of the conference will be brother Fan P'ei Chen's house in Mu Teh Village near Ma Chan Town. (There is a meeting in the Lord's name in his house, which is the meeting in Ma Chan spoken of in Collection of Newsletters.) This is in the center of the P'u Men countryside and is connected with the southern area of Nan Kang River. Brother P'ei Chen's house is very large. It can hold several hundred people. We have set the dates for September 18 to the 23. On the one hand, we ask God to raise up His work, and on the other hand, we are writing to you to invite you to come help us. This has been our hope for many years. It is also what we earnestly pray for night and day before God. Furthermore, our work has just begun and there are many errors. We hope that you can come advise us so that we can continue in the Lord's way straightly without going off to the right or the left and can glorify God's name. When this letter arrives, please send us an answer quickly. If you yourself cannot come, it would be best if you could send another brother. We respectfully make this request. We bless you with joy in the Lord.</P><P>Your little brothers,<br>Fan P'ei Chen, Lee Kuan Hsin, Lin Wei Ch'ing,<br>Lee Hsi Ming, Wen Ching Yi, Su T'i Sheng,<br>Fan Chun Shan, Lin Li Ming</P><P>We greet Brothers Witness Lee, Chang Kuang Jung, Chou Hsin Yi, and Ho Yueh Chiao with this and will not send them another letter.</P><P>Mailing Address: c/o Mr. Wen Ching Yi, Ma Chan, P'u Men, Chekiang</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Two</H2><P>To my dear brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee:</P><P>I was able to attend only one meeting of the Third Overcomer Conference. I received the important message on "God's Center" which gave me a deeper knowledge of the Lord. I really thank the Lord deeply for His grace. In this message, you spoke one word which touched me: "Some people listen to the word of truth secretly, read the books which testify to the word of the truth, and receive some light and then follow the Lord. But they do not give others the impression that they are following those who preach the truth. The Lord allows this to happen because He wants the preacher to take Him as the Head and so that the preacher himself would not gain anything." At that time, I considered myself as one who secretly watched and listened to a preacher of the truth. I began reading The Christian in 1928 and received the light and saw the error of denominations. However, I was still hard-hearted and my faith was weak; I dared not leave the denominations. What is more, I was good friends with the leaders of the denomination. If I left, they would have criticized me. I also saw that the brothers who were already going this way were usually standing alone, oppressed, opposed, and misunderstood. For these reasons, I did not come forward. But God would not let me go. He led me step by step until I saw the sin of the denominations more clearly and their opposition to the truth more vehemently. At first I thought I could stand in the middle and be a mediator so that both sides would have peace. I was hoping that the denominations could change for the better, while the brothers seeking the truth could give in a little, and the two could be one. In this way they both could work to testify to the truth, and the Body of Christ would not be divided. Much unnecessary criticism would also be avoided and outsiders would not be frustrated in the hearing of the gospel. Who would have known that these were my own personal, ignorant thoughts? They were not according to the principles of the Bible and were completely impossible. The denominations can never be changed. The fleshly have always persecuted the spiritual. The son of the maidservant could not live with the son of the promise in the end. So in the end, the only thing to do was leave the denominations and resign from my post as preacher in a certain church. I relied on the Lord's own leading to do His work and began to learn something of obeying the Lord and walking in His way. The experience described above lasted for about four or five years. I think I am one of the slowest to obey. I have not communicated with you until now. For this reason, I say I am one who secretly gains the truth. I hope you will pray for me when you receive my letter that I may keep the will of God and walk in His way because I feel that I am an extremely weak person. Thank God, I still have some good news to tell you. In the place where I used to work, Luan Shan of Nan Kang (an Independent Church is there), some brothers received the light of the truth a few years ago. They have been meeting separately for four or five years. (The locality is Chung Tai of Luan Shan; in Collection of Newsletters it was written as the meeting in Luan Shan.) In the last two years, God has also led brothers in the Independent Church to understand the truth and realize that they must leave the denominations. They have stopped attending the general conventions and the spring and winter conferences and have begun meeting in the Lord's name to break bread for about the last two years. However, the brothers in the meeting in Chung Tai still do not dare to acknowledge them for fear that they left the denominations for human reasons. After I left the denomination, the brothers there began to pursue the Lord more ardently and gave the manifestation of leaving the denominations and expressed more and more the reality of leaving the denominations. For this reason, the brothers in the meeting in Chung Tai moved to that place (Ta Pu Tou, Luan Shan, in the old meeting place) two months ago to meet together with them. Now there are more than forty brothers and sisters meeting together in the morning to break bread. There are about two hundred attending the message meeting in the afternoon. Every Wednesday night we have a Bible study. Friday afternoon is the sisters' meeting. In the evening the brothers meet to pray and fellowship. The brother responsible for preaching is Brother Chen Shu Yao. The brothers responsible for practical affairs are Liu Chien Chung, Tseng P'ing K'ang, and Hsieh Ch'ing Sheng. May the Lord bless the meeting there. I have described the matters there to you briefly. May the Lord bless you and your work and bless all the brothers and sisters in Shanghai who are walking in the same way. Amen. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>The smallest in the Lord,<br>Lin Cheng Wu<br>July 13</P><P>Mailing Address: c/o Fan Yu K'ang, Ma Jan, P'u Men, P'ing Yang, Chekiang</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM CHANGCHOW, FUKIEN PROVINCE</H2><P>To our brother in the Lord, Mr. Watchman Nee:</P><P>The people in the denominations here often say that our meeting is not according to the Bible because it is not organized and because in the Bible there are the titles of elder and deacon. Although we have the reality, it gives people an excuse to refuse us because we do not have the names. We do not know how to answer this kind of question. If there are people in the meetings that are like elders and deacons, would it be all right to openly acknowledge them before the brothers and sisters and give them the title? We hope you will instruct us.</P><P>We are writing about the condition of the meeting in Changchow in general and ask you, brother, to publish it in Collection of Newsletters. Although we have prayed much before writing about these matters, if there is any problem with the language or any punctuation that needs to be added, please give it to the brother responsible for Collection of Newsletters to freely edit and correct the punctuation.</P><P>Furthermore, we would like to make a suggestion concerning the names of the responsible brothers in each locality. If a list of these names could be printed and sent to each locality, then when brothers and sisters travel with letters of recommendation from the responsible brothers, whoever sees the letters would know immediately whether the letter is authentic and where they are from. We do not know whether this is a good idea or not.</P><P>Mr. Nee, if the Lord is willing, we really hope that you can come again to southern Fukien to help us. Please remember the churches in southern Fukien. We have been hoping for several years now! May the Lord lead. Peace!</P><P>Your brothers,<br>Wu Feng Yuan, Chen Ch'eng Ch'ing,<br>Teng Chu Ch'in, Kuo Shu P'an<br>July 11, 1934</P><P>Mailing Address: 30 Po Ai Road, South Market End, Changchow, Fukien</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Answer</H2><P>According to the Bible, the church is not without organization. It has an organization, but it is not like the organization of man's will today. The Bible shows us that a local church has elders and deacons. They are chosen and established by the apostles. Today the church is desolate. There are no apostles, so there is no one in the church today with the authority to establish elders and deacons. Nevertheless, we can act according to the principles used by the apostles in establishing elders and deacons and allow some of the older (especially in spirituality), more stable brothers to rise up and bear the responsibility of the elders. We can also allow some of the more spiritual brothers and sisters who can manage affairs to rise up to bear the burden of the deacons. We can let the brothers and sisters know that these people are bearing the responsibility for these offices in the meeting, but we cannot give them the title of the offices. This is because today no one has the authority to formally establish elders and deacons, so no one can formally give anyone the title of elder or deacon. Please see Issue No. 5 of this publication.</P><P>It would be helpful to all the localities to publish a list of the responsible brothers in each locality. However, we will not be able to print a book like this immediately. In the second issue of this publication we published the names of the responsible brothers in all the meetings in the region of Fu Ning County, northern Kiangsu. Beginning with this issue, we will do our best to publish the names of the responsible brothers of each meeting at the end of the news from that meeting. We hope that from now on when the brothers communicate with us they will tell us the names of the responsible brothers in their localities.&mdash;Editor</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BEGINNING AND HISTORY OF THE MEETING<br>IN CHANGCHOW, FUKIEN PROVINCE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Very Beginning</H2><P>In 1925 Brother Watchman Nee came to the denomination here to lead a revival meeting. Brother Wang T'an Ch'i was revived and Brother Teng Chu Ch'in received salvation and was later baptized and left the denominations. However, at the time Brother Wang was living in Amoy and Brother Teng was in Changchow. Sometimes when Brother Wang returned to Changchow on the Lord's Day, they met in Brother Teng's house and preached the gospel. At that time Brothers Ch'in Szu Hsien and Wu Feng Yuan attended the meetings. Later, the Lord also raised up Brother Teng Chih Ch'eng (Brother Teng's younger brother). Therefore, the two of them had the table meeting in their home to remember the Lord a few times. This was the condition at the very beginning.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Next Stage</H2><P>In 1930 there was a Brother Han Chin Hsiu who was very zealous in the church of the Seventh-day Adventists and was a believer who knew the Bible well. He was a good friend of Brother Kuo Shu P'an. Brother Han's original idea was to lead Brother Kuo and his whole family into the church of the Seventh-day Adventists (at that time, Brother Kuo was a member of the London Mission). Therefore, he moved his dental practice into Brother Kuo's office (Brother Kuo is a Western medical doctor), hoping to have a good opportunity to introduce the doctrines of the Seventh-day Adventist Church to the Kuo family through his move. (Brother Han used to be a dentist and a preacher in the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Then Brother Han went to Tung An. In the Seventh-day Adventist Church, he picked up many old copies of The Present Testimony. He read them carefully one by one and the Lord Himself led Brother Han to understand His word. It was not long before he left the Seventh-day Adventists. Now he preaches the Word full-time in the Amoy region. He originally wanted to bring Brother Kuo into the Seventh-day Adventist Church, but now he walks in the Lord's way with us. The Lord's grace is very marvelous! Praise Him!) Finally, Brother Kuo was stirred up to gather a few zealous members of his denomination to study the Bible carefully. The Holy Spirit caused Brother Kuo, his father Kuo Wan Ch'ing, Brother Wu Feng, and the rest of the brothers to understand from the Bible the error of the Seventh-day Adventists and to see that if they wanted to walk in the Lord's way they had to leave all the traditions of man. At this time, the three of them, Brothers Teng, Wu, and Kuo, began to keep the Lord's command by faith and broke bread to remember the Lord for several months in the Teng home. There was a brother named Chen Ch'eng Ch'ing who had been a member of the denominations for thirty years or more. He had studied the Bible daily for the previous five or six years and had realized that the denominations were too far off the path. He was looking for people with the same heart that he had when he met Brother Kuo by chance at a friend's place. Once they began talking about the condition of the church, they discovered to their surprise that they were of the same will and same thought. We confess that this was the Lord's leading. Glory to the Lord's name. Amen.</P><P>At this great turning point, the Lord led his faithful servant, Brother Simon Meek, to lead the meeting in Changchow. We met in the Kuo home. Later, the Lord also raised up two brothers, Chang Li Chin and T'u Yu Lin. (Brother T'u died in 1932.) They met to break bread every Lord's Day evening in the Kuo home. (In the day they still met in the denominations or went to work.) During this time period Brother Wang T'an Ch'i came to their meetings often and rendered them much help.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Proper Beginning and History</H2><P>Not long afterward, the brothers were reminded that they should do their part in preaching the gospel and should not just take care of themselves. As a result, they discussed renting another house so that those who desired the Word could come to the meetings. Thus, the meetings began in February of 1931 in the newly rented building. Brothers Chen, Wu, Kuo, Chang, T'u Yu Ling, and Kuo Wan Ch'ing were baptized soon after this. At this time Brother Lin Wei Min (who was baptized and left the denominations) also attended the table meetings. The table meeting was in the morning, and the gospel meeting was in the afternoon.</P><P>When we began to obey like this, the persecution came. Many people in the denominations said that we were like children building a house of clay tiles; it could not last very long. They said this to our face, in anonymous letters of criticism, or in mocking. Thank and praise the Lord because He is faithful. Those who trust in Him will not be put to shame.</P><P>During this time, two faithful servants of the Lord, James Chen and Cheng Chih Ch'eng came often to help.</P><P>Although we had only a heart to obey the Lord (the brothers and sisters left but not because they hated those in the denominations; moreover, Brother Kuo was the son-in-law of a famous pastor in a large denomination in Fukien), when we started the meetings, we were still very immature with regard to the truth of the church. Then the Lord sent one of his faithful servants with a few brothers to us at the end of 1931. All the brothers among us became clearer about the truth of the church. Not long after this, we also received Brother Faithful Luk to come lead the meetings. Brother Simon Meek also came with him for a day because he had to pass through Amoy on his way to the Philippines. At the time nine men and women were baptized. With the exception of one brother and two sisters who are still in Changchow, the rest were from other places and have all scattered to other places. In 1932 the Lord also saved the household of Brother Chen Wen Chang. This household used to zealously worship Buddha. Now they have been enlightened by the Lord and are very zealous in testifying for the Lord.</P><P>The year before last, Brother James Chen also shared several portions from his notes on the 1931 conference in Shanghai concerning the matter of the church. We who received it profited deeply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Present Condition</H2><P>Every Tuesday we preach the gospel in our homes. On Wednesday afternoon there is a sisters' prayer meeting. On Thursday afternoon there is a Bible study meeting. On Saturday evening there is a brothers' prayer meeting. Every Lord's Day morning there is a table meeting and an edification meeting. There are about thirty who attend. In the afternoon there is a gospel meeting which usually has about forty or fifty who attend. Eleven brothers and twelve sisters have been baptized, including the eleven who were added in June of this year.</P><P>The preceding description of the condition of the church in Changchow was written according to what a few brothers were able to remember of the history. There is really not much of it that is worth saying. However after reading Collection of Newsletters, we have come to know that this kind of mutual fellowship is really necessary, so we wrote concerning what the Lord's grace has done in Changchow. We want the brothers and sisters who walk together with us in the Lord's way in all the localities to know the general situation, and we also ask you all to pray for us because we are still immature. We also lack workers for the day to day work of visiting each house and watering the brothers and sisters. Even more we lack workers among the sisters. Our most desperate need now is the watering work. The Lord's Day is the time of sowing, but the seeds must be watered during the week before they can grow. We deeply hope that the brothers and sisters in one accord will pray more for the work here so that all the glory may be given to the Lord's holy name. Amen.</P><P>Brothers Chen Ch'eng Ch'ing and Kuo Shu P'an usually bear the responsibility for speaking in the meetings. The rest of the brothers also give testimonies from time to time.</P><P>The responsible brothers in the meeting are: Chen Ch'eng Ch'ing, Teng Chu Ch'in, Wu Feng Yuan, and Kuo Shu P'an.</P><P>The address of the meeting is: 30 Po Ai Road, South Market End, Changchow, Fukien.</P><P>Wu Feng Yuan, Chen Ch'eng Ch'ing,<br>Teng Chu Ch'in, Kuo Shu P'an<br>July 11, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM CHIA HSING, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>Peace to my brother in the Lord, Brother Lee:</P><P>Thank Him for protecting me and allowing me to arrive safely in Chia Hsing. Everything was peaceful upon my arrival in Chia Hsing because Brother Lo Yung Tien, who walks with us together in the way in the Lord, assisted me.</P><P>I have almost nothing to do in the day except read. Every time I think of you and the meeting there, it really makes me feel lonely. By leaving you all and the warm atmosphere of mutual love, I have really felt the coldness elsewhere, especially yesterday on the Lord's Day. My heart really hurts with loneliness. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>I am the youngest in my family; therefore, when I first came here, I felt really weak. Brother Lo and I can only pray for God to revive His work Himself. May God prepare a meeting place for us. May the Lord Himself establish His table. Now we can only pray and wait. First we pray that the Lord will keep our standing and cause us to be sheep who follow Him. We do not want to run in front of Him by acting in the flesh or by being zealous for Him. At the same time, we pray that we will not shrink back so that we can be His strong, enduring soldiers. Of course there are a few brothers here who hope that Mr. Nee can come for a visit. We think that if the Lord gives us a meeting place, you will be willing to come here to nourish us through our relationship as members.</P><P>Every day I only read the Bible and other books. My heart is not at ease. Sometimes I think, "Be bold, be bold." Sometimes I think, "Wait, wait." Sometimes I wonder how I could bear responsibility for the Lord's work, because I am so immature and weak. At other times, I think the Lord is great, that He bears the responsibility, and that He knows everything. So I am fearful and worried one minute and peaceful and confident the next. But now I have only one thing&mdash;prayer. I endure and wait to see the Lord express His glory. I do whatever He says. I keep thinking of the principles in John 5:19, and I am willing to live according to these principles: (1) I can do nothing by myself; (2) I see that the Lord has done; and (3) I do so accordingly.</P><P>I now know that since this place has a few brothers who desire the Lord, it should have the Lord's table. What do you think? However we must wait until the brothers have the same view, and the hand of God arranges it. Do you think this is right?</P><P>In your prayer, please do not forget to pray for us so that the Lord would revive His work in Chia Hsing. If you think there is the need to mention it in the prayer meeting, it would be good to do so. Finally, ask the Lord to keep me as an empty, righteous, holy, and faithful vessel in His hand!</P><P>I hope we do not have fellowship only in our prayer, but at the same time I hope you will have a little time to help me by your letters so you can give me some light and exhortation.</P><P>The weather is very hot, but it is bearable. I have written enough. Until we meet again. May the grace of the Lord be with you always!</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>Chang Yu Chih<br>August 6</P><P>(Note: Brother Chang Yu Chih was a student in Shanghai. Recently he has gone to Hsiu Chou Private Secondary School in Chia Hsing, Chekiang to be a teacher.&mdash;Editor)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM SOOCHOW, KIANGSU PROVINCE</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters</P><P>who are dispersed in all the localities,</P><P> may you have peace and may you receive much grace and mercy in the great love of the Lord:</P><P>Thank our Lord that He purchased us with His priceless blood so we could pass from death to life and be one in Him. Although we are not together and there are some whom we have never met or seen, we are all members together in His Body. Our relationship is very close, and no one can separate us. Because we are members one of another, we have the boldness to report something to the brothers and sisters of the condition of the meeting in the Lord's name in Soochow. At the same time, we ask you to remember us in prayer.</P><P>The beginning of the meeting in Soochow was completely the Lord's work. Originally there were brothers and sisters in Soochow, but they did not know each other. The brothers felt that the Lord's grace was boundless, so every Lord's Day morning they met to break bread and remember the Lord. At that time the meeting was temporary and could not be considered the Lord's table. It was never in a set place. Sometimes it was in Hui Han Elementary School. Sometimes it was in the home of T'ang Hsing. The sisters did not know that the brothers were having such meetings, so they could only go to Shanghai one Lord's Day a month to break bread and fulfill their desire to remember the Lord. Thank the Lord's grace. He did not want to let us continue in this way. Last summer he sent Brother Chou Hsin Yi to Soochow. Through his introduction and explanation, the brothers met three sisters, Tso Fu Ju, Ku Yung Hua, Shao Hsueh Cheng, who work in the Gospel Hospital. It is hard to describe the joy that the brothers and sisters felt. On the one hand, we thanked the Lord for His grace that we could meet brothers and sisters in the Lord, and on the other hand, we asked the Lord Himself to enable us to have His own table in Soochow. Praise and thank the Lord, He answered our requests. Not long after this, a meeting of both the brothers and the sisters to break bread and remember the Lord began in Sister Ku's house on Shih T'ang Ch'iao Alley, Hsi Pei Street. At first we could only break bread once every two weeks because of limitations of time. Later, the desperateness of the brothers and sisters to remember the Lord overcame the limitations of time. So on the first day of every week, we meet to break bread. The Lord used His own love&mdash;the length, breadth, height, and depth of which cannot be &mdash;to draw many brothers and sisters who loved Him to come one by one to meet with us and break bread. Two elderly brothers, Yin Jen Sheng and Ch'in Yao Ch'ing, have come. There is also Brother Sung Chih Jen. Three sisters who teach at Ying Hua Girls' School have come. They are P'an Lu Chen, Yu Ch'i Sheng, Shang Chih Ch'uan. There are also Mrs. Ying, Mrs. Ch'in, and Mrs. Liang and many sisters from the Gospel Hospital.</P><P>Once God's work started, the frustrations and attacks of the enemy followed. The enemy caused the responsible brother to become unusually weak physically. He also caused all the denominations in Soochow to frustrate us in many ways. At first the denominations thought they could use us to do a building work for them, so they even invited the brothers among us to preach messages to them. Later, they realized that the way we were taking could never be compromised with theirs. This made them feel uneasy; therefore, they preached that we were those who destroy the church. They also said we were communists and heretics. They started a so-called pastoral alliance and suggested that (1) they should fire all those who work among them and also come to our meeting to break bread, (2) they should blockade us and not invite us to give messages to them anymore, and (3) they should begin a unified revival meeting to revive their members. Thank our Lord, He is the authority. If He is for us, who can be against us? Although the hospital has wanted to fire our sisters a few times, the Lord still has not allowed it, and it has not come to pass. On the contrary, the Lord has blessed the work in the hospital, so that those who do not believe receive the Lord and those who believe the Lord obey Him. Although the revival meeting that started out of jealousy was actually carried out, we have been blessed by the Lord and have not felt any negative effects. For this we thank the Lord's tender love in making us worthy to suffer shame for Him, and we also ask Him to forgive the ignorant ones and to open their hearts. The preceding story relates to Satan's persecution through the denominations. He still has other means to frustrate the Lord's work. But the Lord's grace is always sufficient. He has already brought us through them one by one.</P><P>The number of people attending the meetings gradually increased, and we felt our original meeting place was not big enough. The brothers and sisters prayed to the Lord in one accord, asking Him to give us a suitable house. Praise the Lord! At the appropriate time He gave us a suitable place. At the end of June we moved from Hsi Pei Street to 2 Kao Shih Alley. T'ang Hsing's home is also there. May the Lord be exalted and glorified there.</P><P>Dear brothers and sisters, please remember our weakness and immaturity. Do not forget to pray for the following matters in your prayers. (1) Ask the Lord to send His own workers to Soochow. (2) Ask Him to raise up local brothers who can bear the responsibility. (3) Ask the Lord to open the door for the gospel in Tung Wu University. (4) Ask the Lord to destroy the enemy's work in Soochow. (5) Ask the Lord to revive all of Soochow. The brothers and sisters in Soochow greet you and thank you for all your prayers and care. We want to thank Brother Chou Hsin Yi, Brother Witness Lee, Brother Watchman Nee, and Brother Ch'ien Neng Sheng. We would also like to thank Sister Miao Yun Ch'un, Sister Ruth Lee, and Sister Peace Wang. They all came at different times from distant places to visit us and gave us much help.</P><P>May our Lord come quickly. At that time, we will meet happily forever with all the saints and will never again be limited by time and space.</P><P>Your brothers,<br>Chang Hsien, Yu Hsien Liang, Stephen Kaung,<br>T'ang Hsing (T'ang Shou Ling)<br>August 10</P><P>Mailing Address: 2 Kao Shih Alley, Soochow</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COLLECTION OF NEWS FROM WENCHOW,<br>P'ING YANG, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>Greetings to the editor of Collection of Newsletters:</P><P>I have received letters from a few brothers and sisters concerning the work in various places and prayer requests. I would not have sent them to you except for the request you made in your publication that any news of the work should be communicated as much as possible. For this reason, five letters for publication are enclosed. Please do not follow your emotions in deciding whether or not to publish them. If you accept them, please correct any mistakes before publication. I bless you with peace, health, and joy!</P><P>From,<br>Wu Sheng</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Letter from<br>Ya Yang, Tai Shun, Chekiang</H2><P>Peace to my brother in the Lord, Brother Wu Sheng:</P><P>These five days of meetings in Ya Yang were especially blessed by the Lord. The messages preached were "The Kingdom of the Heavens." Brothers and sisters came from ten different localities. There were about two hundred people in the meetings, and they all were in one accord. Please pray for this time of the work. I am still in Ya Yang resting. If there are any books and letters for me, please give them to this brother from Tai Shun. Are there any matters in the meeting in Ch'iao Tun that need to be prayed for? If there are, please notify me so I can ask the brothers and sisters who love the Lord in Ya Yang to pray. Moreover, Brother Lai Kung Ho translated for me during our recent labor in Ya Ying. I was very released in my speaking. Mr. Ts'ai Ts'e Wu (also known as Mr. Chi Ch'ing) came to the meetings to hear the messages. He is in one accord with us. Please pray for him. I bless you with peace in the Lord!</P><P>From the Ya Yang Meeting Hall,<br>Wang Yu T'ing<br>March 27, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Letter from<br>Ko Ling, Tai Shun, Chekiang</H2><P>Greetings to Brother Chang Wu Sheng:</P><P>Although I have not seen you or greeted you since we parted, I met with you in prayer. May the Lord bless you with peace. Brother, in the midst of great trial last year, I still maintained my full joy. In a time of extreme poverty, I experienced the manifestation of abundant grace and love. Thank the Lord. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>At the conference in Shanghai, the year before last, Mr. Nee said to me that I should not be so anxious. I have not been anxious. I have only prayed with an earnest heart and tears. You have also prayed for me. Thank the Lord, I received a revelation from God in my prayer to read all of Ephesians 1, Hebrews 11:24-31; 12:1-2, and Joshua 3:4 and verse 14 to the end of the chapter. As a result, I received the teaching of the Scripture. I also asked the Lord to use the environment to restrict me, and He did. Now I have "come out from among them" and have left the realm of being a hired employee in the denominations. I really praise God. I have already ceased my own soulish work and have returned home to read the Bible, pray, and wait. I ask you and the brothers and sisters to thank God for what He has done for me. If the Lord is willing, I hope to come to you soon and meet with you to talk about the Lord's grace. May glory be to the Lord's name and blessings and peace be to us. Amen.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Wang Chu You<br>May 1</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Letter from Ting Pu, P'ing Yang, Chekiang</H2><P>To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Wu Sheng:</P><P>I have been lying in bed all day for the past few days. I am physically exhausted. I do not have the strength to get up and move around. I have no energy to speak or be social. I really hope to take a trip to Wu Tai, Ch'iao Tun. However, it does not look like I will be able to fulfill this desire in the near future. I hope you will pray for me. With respect to the brothers in Kuan Mei, Wu Tai, or any other place, if they zealously desire to be baptized, we will baptize them. But it is best that we are not directed by our emotions. This is crucial. (Parts omitted.) Thank the Lord! I bless you with peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your brother,<br>Wang Yu T'ing<br>June 6</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Letter from Yung Chia, Wenchow, Chekiang</H2><P>To the brother in the Lord, Mr. Chang:</P><P>May God bless you and give you peace. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>My whole family came out of the denominations (China Inland Mission outside the great South Gate in Wenchow) on April 11 and we moved to the north end of Wu T'ien Street. It is about ten miles from the town. We opened a small Chinese and Western medical hospital. My husband (Mr. Huang Lan Ju) is in much better physical health. We should thank God unceasingly for His grace. I only feel that we are very immature in our spiritual journey. I have many kinds of worldly affairs and I do not have much time to read the Bible or pray. It is really dangerous. I hope the Lord can bring me to an appropriate place to live a spiritual life in order to walk in the way of the cross and wait for the Lord's coming. I do not know yet what the Lord's will is. Please pray for me. I will tell you more another day. Until we meet again.</P><P>Your little sister in the Lord,<br>Mu Chen<br>June 18</P><P>(The place where our whole family worships on the Lord's Day is at Sha Mao River in the town.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Recent News from<br>Hu Shan, P'ing Yang, Chekiang</H2><P>To my brother in the Lord, Wu Sheng:</P><P>I am sure that you have received and read my last letter. Praise God, He hears the prayers of His children. The winds and waves are calm now and Sister Shu Liang has been comforted by the Lord. She has received happiness in her spirit and peace in her body. Thank the Lord, and thank you for your prayer.</P><P>Brother Hsu Jung San from Feng Chuan met with me a few days ago and talked about the meeting in his locality. They hope that after the fall they can have a conference there. They plan to invite Brother Wang Yu T'ing to lead the conference. Please notify him in advance. We would like to know how he is right now. Brother Hua Shih Pin wrote us a letter asking me to go to visit him. It seems that I will not have the opportunity soon, so I am asking you to greet him for us.</P><P>Brother Hua Shih Pin led a conference in Ch'u Chou from June 1 to June 11. God had already begun working there. After the conference he went to Hangchow and saw Brother Watchman Nee, Brother Witness Lee, and Brother Chou Fu An. He stayed there two days and then went to Shanghai for one night before going to Ningpo for one day. He preached the gospel there with Brother David Hsu before returning home. There will be a workers meeting in Ning Hai from July 17-27. Brother David Hsu will preach the Word and lead the Bible study. Please notify the brothers to pray much. I am now in Hsia Hsi of Pei Kang. We have decided to begin the meetings on July 25. I also ask you to please pray for this matter. Ask the Lord that it be His own work so that His name will be glorified greatly. May God be with you and all the brothers and sisters. Amen.</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>Chou Ta Ching<br>July 10, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Answering Letter</H2><P>Greetings to Brother Ta Ching:</P><P>I met with Brother Wang Yu T'ing for several days. We spoke about the importance of having a meeting for all the co-workers from various places. There should be one at least once a year. We are already praying. If the Lord is willing, we hope to meet in the fall when it is cool. (We plan to hold it in Ting Pu T'ou.) Therefore, Brother Wang cannot give you an answer concerning the conference in Feng Ch'uan at this time. May the Lord's will be done. Please pray much. Thank you for your greetings to us.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Wu Sheng</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM TAISHAN,<br>KWANGTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>To the sisters in the Lord in Shanghai:</P><P>We wrote a letter to you when we left Swatow and told you something of the condition in Swatow. Now we will tell you something of the condition of Kung Ho City in Taishan.</P><P>We arrived in Kung Ho City on July 12. Kung Ho City is a country town in Tai Cheng County. Although it is only fifteen or sixteen miles from the city, everything is very rustic with the exception of a few new buildings in town.</P><P>We began the work on July 16. (We worked for five days every week.) The first half of the first week we only preached the gospel. The second half of the week, half of the work we did was for sinners and half for new believers. Some were clearly saved, but the number was not large. There were four or five who said they believed, but I dared not say with assurance that they were saved. The second week was entirely for believers. Thank God, most of the sisters received a little help.</P><P>Although it was very hot the first week, there were usually about one hundred people in the meetings. During the second week, there were two meetings a day, and it rained every day. The weather was cool, like the beginning of fall. There were between forty to fifty people in the meetings every day. God really graced us. If the weather had been too hot and the attendance too mixed, it would not have been so easy to get through.</P><P>These last two days I have been doing a little individual work with the sinners who are on the borderline. After meeting and talking with them one by one, I know their situation, and it is easier to pray for them. There are seven or eight like this. Please pray for them also that they may be saved soon.</P><P>The Lord really used Sisters Lei and Lin. Over the past few years they have already gained more than forty sisters. These two sisters were originally going to give us hospitality, but then all the sisters wanted to have a part. They also manifested their diligence in other matters besides hospitality. Their offerings in love covered all our lack. Although they live in the country, they are the same as the sisters in Swatow in this matter.</P><P>Even the few sisters in the Presbyterian Church who come every day to hear the message have manifested their love in the Lord in their treatment of me.</P><P>I say this, not in the way of praising them for being good to me. I have really seen the Lord's work in them. Sometimes I am afraid it is difficult for them, but the responsible sisters said that they are usually like this in their treatment of others because the love of the Lord constrains them. I also hope that the sisters in Shanghai will treat all the sisters from other localities who pass through Shanghai and all the working sisters in the same way. I always thank my God. The love of all the sisters always causes me to weep. I can only ask the Lord to reward you and them richly!</P><P>There are quite a few sisters here with a good ability to understand. However, the gifts of Sister Lei and Sister Lin are in the preaching of the gospel. They teach during the week, and this presents some difficulties in the matter of edification. This matter requires your prayer. I told the two sisters that children are born, but there is no one to take care of them. They hope a sister who is a little deeper in spiritual life can come for a longer time to cultivate the sisters for a while.</P><P>Every day I have a time with the two sisters to pray together and to talk about the matters of the work. I confess that the only thing that can be of any help to others is for us to first learn the lesson before God and pass through the experience. Otherwise, it is hard to escape being idealistic, and there will not be any assurance in the work.</P><P>Tomorrow (August 1), I will leave Kung Ho City for Kung Yi Pu (more than ten miles from here). I will stay there for four or five days and work with a small number of the sisters. On August 8, I will go to Kwangchow. On August 11, I will go to Hong Kong. I will hold meetings in Hong Kong for five or six days beginning on August 13. Then perhaps I will go to Amoy for five or six days. I do not know yet if I will go to Hsing Hua. I still must receive a letter from the co-working sisters and see what the feeling in the Body is before deciding.</P><P>I have slept pretty well this trip. Every time I leave a place, God always has His special arrangement with regard to time. Please give thanks with me to God for all these matters.</P><P>I pray for you often. If there is a special need, I pray for it almost every day. You have already prayed for me, please continue to pray to God so that He will bless all the seeds that have been sown and that they will grow. May God bless you in all things!</P><P>Your sister,<br>Ruth Lee</P><P>P.S. There is a sister here who is a young widow. She sells soybean sprouts for a living. She has to support her mother-in-law and a young daughter. Her father-in-law is abroad and does not remember her financially. God has blessed her. When others cannot sell their bean sprouts, she is always able to finish selling hers. When she sells them, she testifies for the Lord. She can read. However, she must get up in the middle of the night and is very exhausted. When the country people see that her business is good, they often try to cheat her. She is very kind and has considerable compassion for others, so she often lends and gives money to people. However, because the people think that she is gullible, they try to cheat her even more. Her face shows the suffering of her labor. She wants to change jobs to be a temporary laborer (either in a hospital or a school). Please ask God to open a way for her. One day she gave me twenty cents. I consider that her money is as the water of Bethlehem (2 Sam. 23:16-17). I could not bear to drink it; I could only offer it for the printing costs of The Glad Tidings. I explained this to her, and she had peace.</P><P>Sister Lei Mei Hsiung is too tired; she must rest for at least a few months. Please pray for her also.</P><P>Ruth Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS FROM PEKING</H2><P>Brother Witness:</P><P>I received and read the card that you sent before. I have been so long in answering, please forgive me for this! (Parts omitted.) There will be a conference soon, so I cannot write too much. Because the Lord has not opened a way to us in the environment and in other needs, we could not hold it in July but waited for God's way. We now clearly understand God's will and time, and we have decided to have a conference for ten days beginning on August 16. The first three days will be for preaching the gospel. The last seven days will be on overcoming. A brother in the Lord will be responsible for the first three days, and I will be responsible for the last seven days. Please pray unceasingly. May the Lord gain the glory!</P><P>Your brother,<br>Hsu Chung Chieh</P><P>Mailing Address: 19 Chi Hsiang Alley, Shih Ching Garden, 4 East Peking</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM HAINAN</H2><P>Greetings to God's faithful servant, Brother Nee:</P><P>Last month I received a letter from three brothers in Singapore (Wang Kai Sen, Yang Jen Chu, and Chang Chia Chi) telling me that the Shanghai Gospel Book Room was publishing Collection of Newsletters on news from the meetings in the Lord's name in every place. When I heard that this good news concerns everyone meeting in the Lord's name, I was very happy and gave thanks and praise to our Lord for the realization of this publication. May the Lord bless the flow of this publication to all the localities so that all the meetings in the Lord's name can receive this good news. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>The number of brothers in Hainan coming to worship God and break bread on the Lord's Day is very small. Brother Ts'ai Shou Lun has already left us and gone to another locality. I do not yet know when he will return. Brother Shih K'e Jen will leave for Southeast Asia soon. May the Lord revive the church in Hainan. I ask the brothers there to pray for the meeting here and to pray for me. I also hope you, Mr. Nee, will guide us in the proper path in the Lord, so that we carry out the Lord's will. Amen. I also greet the brothers in the Lord with peace!</P><P>Your little brother in Christ,<br>Yun Feng Chan<br>July 6, 1934</P><P>Mailing Address: c/o Hung Sheng Hao, Wen Ch'ang Pai Yen City, Hainan, Canton.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER TO BROTHER WANG KAI SEN</H2><P>Brother Kai Sen:</P><P>I received your question concerning whether or not the Open Brethren are a denomination, and I am writing several facts that I know so the brothers in your locality can determine for themselves.</P><P>(1) They have a name. They have a missionary board called the Christian Mission to Many Lands which is abbreviated as C.M.M.L. It does not matter whether or not it is a real organization or something done as a matter of convenience. A special name is already the action of a denomination.</P><P>(2) They have a center. They have a central organization in Bath, England. All the offerings collected by the meetings in each locality are sent to Bath and two brothers there administrate them and send them to every country in the world for those who work for the Lord among them. In this way, the workers who have a good relationship with Bath receive more money. Those who do not, receive less money. This also means that when their workers say they live by faith, it is empty words. Actually, in their hearts they know that there will be money coming from Bath. Furthermore, this makes Bath into a little Rome because the workers must subconciously acknowledge Bath or they will have to worry about losing their living. The workers do not receive the offering directly from the hand of the believers or the church. All of their property purchased abroad is not offered to the Lord and then put into the workers' hands to administer as the Lord leads. All of their property is administrated by a Steward's Company in England. The name used on all the contracts and deeds is the name of the company. Is this not centralized administration?</P><P>(3) They have hired workers. The Western workers among them receive money from Bath, so the Chinese workers among them automatically receive their salaries from the Western missionaries. The preachers among them receive a predetermined amount in salary like those in other denominations, because they believe that if they do not do this, the work can not be carried out.</P><P>(4) They have a hierarchy. The hierarchy of the priesthood is something of Judaism. Christianity should not have it. The basic difference between the New Testament and the Old Testament is that all the believers in the New Testament are priests and there is not a group of special people acting as priests. The Nicolaitans in the ancient church, the Roman priests, and the Protestant pastors have all become a modified hierarchy of priesthood.</P><P>The Westerners among them usually accept the honorific title of pastor. At the same time, they stand in an elevated position in their meetings. Recently, one of their co-workers in Jehol rose up to oppose this, but he met with fierce opposition. They have followed the denominations around them to have the hierarchy of priesthood.</P><P>(5) Their way. After we began a meeting in Shanghai, they established a separate table meeting. After we had begun a meeting in Kuling in the winter, they came the next summer and established another table.</P><P>Brother, what I have written above are all facts. You need to pray much before the Lord to determine whether or not you should have fellowship with them or be among them. All questions are not just outward; they are a matter of whether or not we are living according to the Christ who is within us. May we be faithful. I bless you with peace.</P><P>From,<br>Watchman Nee<br>The thirtieth</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER ABOUT<br>THIS PUBLICATION AND THE CO-WORKERS</H2><P>Dear Brother Witness:</P><P>(Parts omitted.) Concerning the articles for Collection of Newsletters, I personally hope that in the future there will be more news about how the brothers and sisters have consecrated to the Lord, about how they have obeyed the Lord and have taken the Lord as Head over all things, about how they have overcome their dryness and entered into the more abundant life, and about how they were delivered from a sinful life and have overcome sin. These spiritual aspects are much more important than outwardly leaving the denominations.</P><P>What is our center? Is our work to preach Christ as Lord or to preach leaving the denominations? I am really fearful that in every locality there are brothers who, being limited in understanding and spiritual experiences before God, only have a little knowledge about outward matters such as baptism, head covering, and denominations, and exhaust their effort to publicize these matters. By doing so, they cause outsiders to misunderstand us, thinking that we only emphasize these outward things and that we do not exalt Jesus Christ as Lord.</P><P>We know that if anyone follows the Lord, he will certainly take care of these outward matters. But it does not mean that anyone who practices these outward things is necessarily following the Lord completely. We must emphasize again and again for the sake of the ignorant brothers among us, that although we believe in these outward matters, yet our testimony, that which makes us different from others, is not in these outward things.</P><P>Another matter which is continually on my heart is the matter of the co-workers. We thank God that many who had rank and position in the denominations have seen the truth of the church. But this is also a problem! Many have seen only the error of sectarianism among the denominations, but have not perceived the wrongness of the system in the denominations. Therefore, while they may have left the denominations, they have not rejected the system. Consequently, they think that since they were workers in the denominations, they can continue in the same way after they have come out of the denominations. They simply do not care whether or not they are gifted or whether or not they have been called by God. Although they have left their particular denominations, they have never left the work which these denominations afforded them. This will cause us to be filled with many unsuitable workers.</P><P>I believe God's will is this: Unless one is clear that he has been called and is definitely gifted, after he leaves the denominations, he should seek a proper occupation and witness for the Lord there. He should never have the thought that since he has been a worker before, he can therefore go ahead and begin a work in any locality. This is the most dangerous thing in our midst. We would prefer a locality be without any worker or work than to be doing something in a loose way. Oh, the flesh must be dealt with!</P><P>I am grateful to God that many have obeyed in these outward matters, yet their obedience is not merely restricted to these matters. These matters are but a part of their obedience to God's will. Unless it emanates from within, anything outward is worthless. (Parts omitted.) Peace be unto you.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Watchman Nee<br>The sixth</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM DR. MU</H2><P>To the brothers who are my co-believers in Christ!</P><P>Since I have decided to separate myself from the co-workers in Jehol (Brethren or C.M.M.L., Christian Mission to Many Lands), my goal in writing this letter is not to criticize them. My only goal is to explain my reasons for this action. I have done this because of a burden I have felt for a long time in my heart. I also waited on God and discussed it with the co-workers in that province before deciding. I believe that by doing this I am placing myself in a better position to practice the proper fellowship with all the children of God, especially with those who obey the principles of the New Testament teachings and patterns. According to what I have seen in my past three years in China, I know deeply that a gospel region controlled by one person with the help of salaried Chinese assistants (almost all of their work receives the supply of foreign money) cannot replace a church that is according to the teachings and patterns of the New Testament. This kind of thing cannot but cause the believers and the sinners to suffer much loss.</P><P>I tried to see if I could take a different way in the northern part of Jehol province. I intended to help the brothers in several localities to maintain the testimony of the Lord. It proved to me that this kind of mission board method had already been planted deeply into their minds. They have already learned how to rely on foreigners and their money, and they cannot believe in the eternally living God to supply the spiritual and material needs of the work. When I opposed the title and position of the pastors, one local brother told me that if no one rose up to manage the church and receive a salary to preach the Word, nothing would get done. He cited numerous instances in and out of Jehol province to prove this.</P><P>Therefore, my first reason for leaving the Brethren is because I do not want to show people that I uphold and approve of that kind of thing. (Actually, before I began to work in Jehol, I did not know anything of the principles of the work there nor did I know that the practices of the work were different from those in my country.)</P><P>I went to Shanghai recently and received great encouragement and help there. I saw a movement there among the Chinese Christians which is found also in many places in China. This movement is one I hear of often. Because they have not seen anything among the many Christian representations in China that is according to the teachings and patterns of the New Testament, they have boldly gone out to follow the teachings and patterns of the New Testament in their meetings. They receive all Christians (unless the Bible has removed their qualification). There are more than one hundred of these meetings in China. More than sixty workers have come out from these meetings, relying solely on the Lord to supply their needs. Many of the brothers in the meetings are country farmers or laborers without an education. I had the privilege of being able to discuss some of the important questions before us with one of their brothers in Shanghai. His English was very fluent, and he has recently been to America and England to see the condition of the Brethren and the meetings there. His name is Watchman Nee. In 1927 he asked the translator of C.H. Mackintosh's volumes on the Pentateuch why the Chinese translation deleted the references to the position, practices, and truth of the church. The answer he received was that the translator had done this purposely to avoid debate. I thought mentioning this should show you what the condition is of the so-called Brethren in the northern and central parts of China.</P><P>I fully believe that this movement is the work of the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, we should adjust our methods through the light of the Bible so that we can work with these Chinese brothers. They have a good reason today to look at our (C.M.M.L.'s) position as being unscriptural and as a denomination.</P><P>The second reason I have for leaving the Brethren is because I want to be able to match the work that I believe is of the Holy Spirit. This work of the Holy Spirit begins by calling a group of God's children out of the denominations to practice the principles and examples in the New Testament. By doing this, perhaps we can accomplish the work which has not been completely started of preaching the gospel in all of China. If not, it will never be done.</P><P>I believe that if I continue to receive monetary support indirectly from a central organization with authority (as the paper The Response does, which uses the money received from subscriptions to help the missionaries connected with it) and do not directly receive offerings from believers in simple meetings that are according to the Bible (three and a half years ago they gave me to the work in China), I will be one who does not practice what he preaches. For this reason, I have already decided to ask them to discontinue supporting me. I now deeply believe that anything added on to local meetings (which were all they had in the days of the apostles) is man-made and will not help the furtherance of the gospel in the long run.</P><P>I confess that the people I am now leaving were once greatly used by God both in their country and abroad. I have also received much help in love from them and much care in prayer. However, this cannot keep me from being responsible before the Lord to do according to what I believe.</P><P>Yours in the one Lord and Savior Christ,<br>Mu Ju Nung</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER CONCERNING<br>THE SISTERS COVERING THEIR HEADS</H2><P>In the seventh issue of Collection of Newsletters, I read Brother David Hsu's letter from Ningpo and the editor's response. I was led by the Holy Spirit and am willing to answer the sisters' question concerning head covering according to the light received from the Lord.</P><P>Today we should lay down all of our own ideas and opinions because they cause people to argue divisively. If we take Christ's mind as our own and have a heart of obedience, we will be able to receive a clear answer from the Lord to any question. Today people bring in man's opinion because they are not willing to obey. They twist the Bible to fit their own personal opinion. This is something we should all reject. Therefore, I would like to examine fully how the Bible treats the matter of sisters covering their heads in order to avoid our own error. If someone finds evidence outside of the Bible concerning the matter of head covering, he is not willing to obey the Word of God and is opposing God. May all the sisters today boldly obey God's commandment and seek to please God so the Lord can gain something!</P><P>The only passage in the Bible concerning the sisters covering their heads is 1 Corinthians 11:2-16. It says:</P><P>"But I praise you because in all things you have remembered me and hold fast the things that I have handed down even as I handed them down to you. But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ. Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraces his head. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved. For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered. For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is God's image and glory; but the women is the glory of the man. For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man; for also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man. Therefore the woman ought to have a sign of submission to authority on her head for the sake of the angels. However neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord. For just as the woman is out from the man, so also is the man through the woman; but all things are out from God. Judge this in your own selves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God? Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him, but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering. But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God."</P><P>What we see from this passage is that it is completely a matter of position. First Corinthians 11:3 says, "Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ." This verse means that everyone (both male and female) belongs to Christ, that the woman belongs to man, and that Christ belongs to God. In another aspect, it means that since Christ is the head of everyone, we all should obey Christ; since man is the head of the woman, the woman should obey the man; and since God is the head of Christ, Christ obeys God. Christ originally had the form of God; however, He did not grasp His equality with God but poured Himself out and willingly took the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men. He obeyed even unto death. Christ kept His position; therefore, He received the name above all names (Phil. 2:6-9). Today each of us (both male and female) should stand in the position God has given us and obey Christ because Christ is the head of each one of us. Since man is the head of the woman, and since woman was created for man, women should stand in the proper position and obey God's command. Today people are not willing to stand in their God-given position to keep His commandments. For this reason, it seems that day by day, more and more things are in rebellion against God! May the Lord shine His light on us so we can obey and stand in the position we were meant to stand in to serve our God and our Lord Jesus Christ.</P><P>From the arguments in 1 Corinthians 11:2-16, we see that women should cover their heads. There are two reasons a woman should cover her head:</P><P>(1) Man is the head of the woman (vv. 3-5).</P><P>The meaning of head covering is that it is a sign of not being the head and of not heading things up. According to these few verses, women should cover their heads to pray and prophesy in order to manifest that the man is the head. Not covering one's head is a denial of man's headship and opposes God's order in His creation. A man should not cover his head because he is the head of the woman. He bears God's image and His glory. If we speak of the spiritual reality, each person (male and female) has a covered head (that is they are not the head) in order to manifest that Christ is the head of each one. Therefore, no matter what, the woman's head should be covered. This is revealed clearly in this section.</P><P>(2) There should be a symbol of authority on the head for the sake of the angels (v. 10).</P><P>Head covering is a symbol of submission to authority. It is a testimony to the angels that the woman created by God is for man and that she acknowledges man as the head in an expression of obedience to the position God gave her. What does it really mean when we say that head covering is for the angels? We should read the two passages in Genesis 3:1-21 and 6:1-4. They give us the reason.</P><P>(a) Genesis 3:1-21 talks about Eve in the garden of Eden being led astray by the serpent into the fall. Eve did not keep her position as a woman. She denied Adam as her head and made herself the head (Adam obeyed Eve&mdash;vv. 6, 17). She did not ask Adam's permission but ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil by herself and of her own will. She took the devil's temptation (the devil was once a shining star, a son of the morning&mdash;Isa. 14:12, one of the anointed cherubim covering the ark of the covenant&mdash;Ezek. 28:14) and fell into sin. For this reason, the New Testament says in 1 Timothy 2:11-14, "Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection; but I do not permit a woman to teach or to assert authority over a man, but to be in quietness. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been quite deceived, has fallen into transgression." Because Eve did not keep her position according to the order of God's creation and did not obey Adam who was formed first, she fell into transgression. For this reason, the sisters today should testify before the angels that they are satisfied with the position God has given them. They should express their obedience to the order of God's creation and stand in the position of a woman to acknowledge the headship of man and obey. Head covering is the symbol of this obedience.</P><P>(b) Genesis 6:1-4 speaks of the sons of God (they are angels&mdash;Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7) seeing the beauty of women and taking wives of all that they chose. (They were the angels who did not stay in their original position&mdash;Jude 6.) The marriage of two different kinds of beings caused the wrath of God to come upon the angels who left their proper position. He imprisoned them in darkness forever until the great day of judgment (Jude 6). Since the human race had become fleshly like the sons of God, God used the flood to destroy them. Woman was created for man to be a mate for man. God never intended that she be joined to the angels. This action was disobedience to God. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 11:9-10 says that woman was created "for the sake of the man. Therefore the woman ought to have a sign of submission to authority on her head for the sake of the angels." Women should cover their heads to prove to the angels that they were created for the sake of man and to express their obedience to God's order in creation, so they need a symbol of submission to authority on their heads.</P><P>Now let us speak of the situation in Corinth at that time. From what is written in chapter eleven, we can clearly know that the believing women in Corinth at that time did not cover their heads. Therefore, Paul exhorted them to cover their heads and told them the reason women should cover their heads. Some people think that Paul gave this type of teaching because head covering was a custom in Corinth. But by reading 1 Corinthians 1:2, we see that this letter was not just written to the people in Corinth, it was also written to all those who call upon the name of the Lord. From the word "every" in 1 Corinthians 11:5, we can see that the women in Corinth were not the only ones who should cover their heads. All women in the Lord should cover their heads. This is a serious command that may not be contended against, because we do not have such a custom in the churches of God. Furthermore, in the Bible, God never asks us to follow the customs of the worldly people. May the Lord's Word be honored and may the Lord's authority have a place in people's hearts.</P><P>Some think that if a woman has long hair she does not need to cover her head because her hair acts as a covering. Please remember that if you believe that a woman should have long hair for a covering, it is sufficient proof that she should cover her head. Look at the wording of 1 Corinthians 11:6. It shows us that women believers in those days were ashamed of cutting their hair. Therefore, the apostle says that if a woman is ashamed to cut or shave her hair, she should cover her head. (A woman who is not ashamed to cut her hair has not arrived at the point of covering her head.)</P><P>One further question concerns when a woman should cover her head. The passage from the Bible in 1 Corinthians 11:2-16 does not clearly say when a woman should cover her head. We do not need to guess whether this passage is talking about the meetings or in private. However, one thing is sure&mdash;when a woman prays or prophesies, she should cover her head.</P><P>Today we should let the Lord be the head. We should each stand in our proper position to serve Him. May God be glorified in the church and in the Lord Jesus Christ forever and ever. Amen (Eph. 3:21).</P><P>Your brother,<br>Hsu Chung Chieh<br>July 14, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BRIEF NEWS FROM VARIOUS LOCALITIES</H2><P>(1) Tsou Ts'ai Kao and Ts'ai Yun Hsien, the two brothers who were imprisoned in northern Kiangsu for suspicion of committing a crime, were freed on June 28.
