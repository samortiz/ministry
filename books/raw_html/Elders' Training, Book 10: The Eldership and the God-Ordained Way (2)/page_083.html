<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Being Heretical</H2><P>The second thing for which a believer can be kept away from the fellowship of the church is being heretical, denying that Christ came in the flesh (2 John 7-11). This implies the denying of Christ's redemptive work, which was accomplished by Christ in His flesh (Rom. 8:3; Col. 1:22). Teaching heresy is not merely a matter of teaching wrongly or differently. In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul said that he had urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently. However, in 2 John 7-11, John was not referring to those who taught differently, but to those who taught heretically, denying that Christ came in the flesh, that is, denying Christ's person in His humanity, and denying His redemptive work. They do not believe that Christ is both God and man who came in the flesh to accomplish redemption for us, the sinners. The apostle John said that if such a one comes to us, we should not receive him into our home, and we should not even greet him. Then John said that if we greet him, saying to him, "Rejoice," we will share in his sin. This is not my word, but the word of the apostle John.</P><P>Thus far, among us there is no one who is teaching heretically. However, there are some who are making divisions and causes of falling.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Committing Gross Sins and Living in Them</H2><P>The third thing for which a believer can be kept away from the fellowship of a local church is the committing of gross sins and living in these sins, not being willing to repent of them and forsake them (1 Cor. 5:9-13). A person who commits gross sins in this way should be removed from the fellowship of the church. But once such a one would repent and forsake his sins, the church should forgive him and receive him into the fellowship of the church, that we may not be taken advantage of by Satan (2 Cor. 2:5-11). In his first Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul charged the church in Corinth to remove a sinful brother from the fellowship of the church. Later, this one repented, and the news came to Paul. Immediately, Paul wrote the second Epistle, charging the church to forgive this one and to receive him back. If we do not do this, we may be taken advantage of by Satan in that he might devour such a repentant one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. How to Deal with the Divisions</H2><P>In dealing with the divisions that have separated themselves from the genuine local churches and have broken the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ, I would like to present to you my proposal, and I believe that this is according to the holy Word.</P>
