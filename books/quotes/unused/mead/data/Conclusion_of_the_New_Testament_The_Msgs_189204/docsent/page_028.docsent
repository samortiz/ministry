   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord Jesus came to His disciples on the day of His resurrection as the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Greek word for "Spirit" in John 20:22 is pneuma, a word that also means breath or air.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 1 Christ is the Lamb, but in John 20, after His death and in His resurrection, He is the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To say that Christ is the pneumatic Christ means that He is full of the divine breath.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whereas in John 1 Christ came as the Lamb, in John 20 He came as the pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fact that He breathed into the disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit indicates that He had come to them as the breath, the pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord became the pneumatic Christ through resurrection, and today, in resurrection, He still comes to us as the Spirit, the pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the Lord Jesus came in John 20:19, there is no word or hint in John's record indicating that the Lord left the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason for this is that He stayed with them, although they were not conscious of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead of leaving them, He disappeared, becoming invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But to the surprise of the disciples, at various times and in different places He would appear, manifesting Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Acts 1:3 tells us that to the apostles "He presented Himself alive after His suffering by many convincing proofs, through a period of forty days, appearing to them."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His appearing does not mean that He ever left them; it simply means that He made His presence visible to them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After appearing to His disciples for a period of forty days, the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ten days later, on the day of Pentecost, He, having again received the consummated Spirit, poured out this Spirit upon all His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At this point we need to consider the difference between the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The essential Spirit is for the believers' spiritual life, living, existence, and being, and the economical Spirit is for God's economy, work, and move.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus breathed the Spirit into the disciples essentially as life for their spiritual existence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, Christ, in His ascension, poured out the consummated Spirit upon His disciples economically as power for their work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Lord's resurrection, the Spirit of resurrection life is likened to breath, breathed into the disciples for their spiritual being and living essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Lord's ascension, the Spirit of ascension power, poured out upon the disciples, is symbolized by wind for the disciples' ministry and move economically Acts 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The essential Spirit of resurrection life is for the believers to live Christ; the economical Spirit of ascension power is for them to carry out His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to see clearly the difference between the breathing in John 20 and the blowing in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The breathing in John 20 is for the imparting of the life-giving Spirit into the believers essentially for their spiritual being and for their spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the blowing in Acts 2 is for the pouring out of the economical Spirit of power upon the believers, who have already received the essential Spirit into them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The pouring out of the Spirit of power is not for the believers' spiritual being or living; rather, the outpouring of the Spirit of power is for the believers' ministry and move.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the essential aspect of the Spirit is for living, and the economical aspect is for ministry.</S>
