[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW COVENANT OUTLINE Not of the letter but of the Spirit 2 Cor 3:6.
[2]  The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life v. 6.
[3]  We are transformed into the image of the Lord from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit v. 18.
[4]  However, if we read the Bible, we can find the terms Christ and Christians which means Christ-men , but we cannot find the term Christianity .
[5]  Suppose that there are four brothers who love the Lord very much and often have fellowship with Him.
[6]  Remember that the Lord whom they love is neither a doctrine nor a religion; He is the Spirit .
[7]  CHAPTER TWO THE WAY TO ENJOY CHRIST OUTLINE Christ is the portion of all those who call upon His name 1 Cor 1:2.
[8]  God has called us so that we may partake of Christ v. 9.
[9]  You may say that you have never called upon the name of the Lord you even may be hard-hearted, but the Lord still has a way to deal with you, and when He does, you will call louder than everyone else.
[10]  Christ becomes wisdom to us as righteousness for our past, as sanctification for our present, and as redemption for our future v. 30 . As our righteousness the Lord covers all of our shameful past, as our sanctification the Lord enables us to live a sanctified life in the present, and as our redemption the Lord will redeem and transfigure our body in the future.
[11]  Praise the Lord that the all-inclusive Christ, who is so full, has become the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who gives life v. 45b; 2 Cor 3:6b . This Christ has become the Spirit, and as the Spirit He is power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
[12]  In other words, if we simply say, Lord Jesus, we will be in the Holy Spirit and will also drink of this Spirit.
[13]  We simply need to open our mouth and call on the Lord from our spirit, calling, O Lord Jesus!
[14]  I am afraid that some of you who love the Lord and have intimate fellowship with the Lord have never called on the Lord like this.
[15]  CHAPTER THREE THE RENEWING OF THE INNER MAN OUTLINE The Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17.
[16]  The Lord as the Spirit is the treasure in us as earthen vessels 4:7.
[17]  Because we have the Lord as life in our spirit, our spirit becomes our inner man Eph 3:16.
[18]  We are being transformed into the image of the Lord, even as from the Lord Spirit, by the renewing of our inner man 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2.
[19]  To be transformed by the renewing of the mind requires the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit to be with us 2 Cor 13:14.
[20]  On the one hand, human beings have a spirit.
[21]  The fact that the Lord is the Spirit implies three things.
[22]  The third thing that this fact implies is that, according to God s plan of redemption, the Lord Jesus was incarnated to become a man, the last Adam, and that one day the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .
[23]  We all need to be clear that the Lord Jesus is in us not only as life but also as a person.
[24]  Today the Lord Jesus is inside of us, but will He be able to possess our whole being, or will we force Him to stay only in our spirit?
[25]  However, in response to your plans, the Lord may try to come into the room of your mind, yet when He tries to do this, right away you shut the door to your mind, saying, Lord!
[26]  For the Lord to make His home in our hearts means that He is able to go from our spirit to our conscience and from our conscience to our mind, emotion, and will, thus occupying our entire heart.
[27]  The Lord has indeed come into our spirit, but He is waiting in our spirit for a chance to spread His influence from our spirit into every corner, every part, of our being.
[28]  The Lord wants to spread His influence in our being to the extent that if He does not move in our mind, we will not think about buying things, if He does not move in our emotion, we will not give our love to anything, and if He does not move in our will, we will not make any plans or decisions.
[29]  CHAPTER FOUR SETTING THE MIND ON THE SPIRIT OUTLINE Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God John 3:6.
[30]  The Lord Spirit lives in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22.
[31]  In addition to a spirit, we also have a soul within us.
[32]  Our soul, which is between our body and our spirit, is our person.
[33]  I know for a fact that if the sisters call, O Lord! as they are picking up a pair of shoes, the One within them will tell them to drop the shoes; if they call, O Lord! as they are taking a skirt off of a rack of clothes, the One within them will tell them to put the skirt back; if they call, O Lord! as they are approaching the next rack, before they could even pick anything up, the One within them will tell them to keep walking; and if they call, O Lord! as they are approaching the next rack, the One within them will tell them to go home.
[34]  If we do, we may look to the Lord to give us love, knowing that we cannot love our wife and that only the Lord can cause us to love her.
