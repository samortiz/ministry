   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>L. The Feeling of the Conscience and the Supply of Grace</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since a normal feeling of the conscience originates from life, the Holy Spirit, and spiritual knowledge, it certainly carries with it the supply of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a glorious characteristic of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Old Testament laws given to man contained only demands without supply.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Testament law of life dispensed into man contains not only demand, but even more, supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The demand in the law of life is met by itself as the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, whenever our conscience reveals the demand of the law of life, giving us a normal feeling to deal with a certain matter, we need but to bow down, worship, and acknowledge that this feeling of God's demand is a preliminary announcement of the supply of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the demand of the feeling in the conscience carries with it the supply of grace, yet if we desire to realize this supply, we must fulfill one requirement: we must respond to this demand in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The supply of God's grace is always dependent upon our trust and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we trust and obey, the supply of God's grace follows.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Otherwise, the supply will not be forthcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God always desires that we first obey by faith in response to all His demands.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then He will supply us with His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, our response to God's demands is our application for God's supply.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, when we ask someone to send a telegram, according to the business principle in the world, we first supply him with money, and then he proceeds to act.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the spiritual principle is that he must first obey and act accordingly; then the money follows.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If someone is afraid to act because of no means, then the money surely will not come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But while he is acting in faith to pay the expense, the money will be in hand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many historical facts in the Bible illustrate this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When God brought Israel through Jordan, the water did not separate before they stepped down; rather they stepped down by faith, and then the waters were separated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The supply of grace is also obtained by faith and experienced in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, anyone learning to deal with the conscience needs to learn the lesson of receiving the supply of God's grace in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every time the feeling in the conscience brings forth a demand, we ought to realize that this is God's supply for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we answer this demand in faith, God's supply will surely come.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our obligation is to respond; God's obligation is to supply.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should be grateful to the Lord that even our believing and obeying are also God-given; they do not necessitate our striving or struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Normally, when a feeling of the conscience corresponds to the growth in life, we spontaneously have faith and submit in obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If ever a feeling of the conscience surpasses our trust in the supply of God's grace and our ability to obey, it is a premature feeling and proves that our growth of life has not reached this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this case we should hide under the blood and wait until our life advances to this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then spontaneously we will have sufficient faith to apply the grace of God and obey the feeling of conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In conclusion, to fulfill the demand of the feeling in the conscience, we certainly need God's supply of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This supply is received through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we fulfill in faith the demand which is in the feeling of our conscience, immediately God's grace comes to supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On one hand, it gives us strength to deal with the matter and obtain cleansing; on the other hand, this supply and grace become interwoven within us, bringing about the growth of life.</S>
