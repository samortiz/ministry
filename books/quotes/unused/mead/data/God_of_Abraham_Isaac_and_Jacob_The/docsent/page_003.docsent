   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why do Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob occupy such a special place in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is because God wants to select a group of people to come under His name and to make them His people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beginning with Abraham, God began to gain a people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God had a spiritual beginning with Abraham, and He did something in Abraham for the purpose of showing us the necessary experience that God's people have to go through.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All of God's people have to go through the same kind of experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did something in Abraham first, giving him some particular experiences, and through him He conveyed these experiences to all of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The nation of Israel is founded upon Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, God has worked not only in Abraham, but also in Isaac, giving him some particular experiences, and through him He conveyed these experiences to all of His people as well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Similarly, God did some work in Jacob, giving him some particular experiences, and through him He conveyed these experiences to all of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The dealings which these three received before God and the experiences they went through culminated in a people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the total experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are the experiences that all of God's people should have.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The attainments of these three should be the attainments of all the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not enough to make us God's people if we merely have Abraham's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not enough to make us God's people if we merely have Isaac's experience, and it is not enough to make us God's people if we merely have Jacob's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must have the attainments of Abraham plus Isaac plus Jacob before we can become God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God told Isaac, "I am the God of Abraham thy father...I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake" Gen 26:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He told Jacob, "I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed" 28:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He also told the Israelites, "I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage" Exo 6:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This shows us that the Israelites entered into the inheritance of the three men, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They did not have any inheritance of their own.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, they entered into the inheritance of the three men, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Each of these men occupies a particular position before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their different spiritual experiences typify three different kinds of spiritual principles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, all the people of God should have the element of Abraham, the element of Isaac, and the element of Jacob in them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without these elements, we cannot become God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's people must have the element of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All true Israelites and all genuine people of God must say that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are their ancestors.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To say that Abraham is our ancestor is not enough, because Ishmael and his descendants can also say that their ancestor is Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither is it enough to say that both Abraham and Isaac are our ancestors, because Esau and his descendents can say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's people must say that their ancestors are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jacob must be included for complete qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All three must be together before we can justifiably be a people of God.</S>
