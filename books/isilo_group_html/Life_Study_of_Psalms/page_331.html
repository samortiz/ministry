In Creating the Heavens,<br>the Earth over the Waters, and the Great Lights</H2><P>Next, the psalmist charges the people to give thanks to God who by understanding made the heavens, who spread forth the earth over the waters, and who made the great lights, the sun to rule the day and the moon and the stars to rule the night (vv. 5-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. In Bringing Forth Israel from Egypt<br>and Marching Them through the Wilderness</H2><P>In verses 10 through 16 we have a word about giving thanks to God who struck Egypt through their firstborn, who brought forth Israel from their midst with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, who divided the Red Sea apart, brought Israel over through the midst of it, and shook off Pharaoh and his force into it, and who marched His people through the wilderness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. In Slaying Great and Majestic Kings of Canaan<br>That He Might Give Their Land to Israel<br>as an Inheritance</H2><P>Verses 17 through 22 are a charge to give thanks to Jehovah for His everlasting lovingkindness in striking great kings and slaying majestic kings and then giving their land as an inheritance to Israel His servant.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. In Remembering Israel in Their Low Estate<br>and Rescuing Them from Their Adversaries</H2><P>Jehovah remembered His people in their low estate and rescued them from their adversaries (vv. 23-24). Sometimes they were defeated by the surrounding Gentiles, who caused them to be in a low estate. Thus they needed God's mercy to remember them and rescue them. For this they were charged by the psalmist to give thanks to Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G.

In Being the God of Heaven</H2><P>Finally, in verse 26 the psalmist charges the people to give thanks to the God of heaven.</P><P>This psalm does not have any crucial points. Nevertheless, in order to write such a psalm, the psalmist had to be a person who was very close to God and who cared for God's interests. Only such a person can write such a psalm.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_330.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_332.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 331</div><br></body></html>
