<p>There are several principles that we must take heed to when we are looking for companions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Looking for Saved Ones</h2>
<p>First, you should not seek companions among unbelievers (2 Cor. 6:14-18). Christians who seek friendship with unbelievers will eventually suffer a loss. An unbeliever can be likened to a person wearing dirty clothes, and a believer can be likened to a person wearing clean white clothes. By spending time together, the person in white clothes will eventually become dirty. We should not be quick to become companions with an unbeliever. Instead, we should preach the gospel to him and lead him to salvation so that he may become a brother in the Lord. Only then should we become his companion, because he would have put off his dirty clothes and put on clean white clothes.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Looking for Those Who Can Be of Mutual Help</h2>
<p>Second, we should look for brothers and sisters who can be of mutual help; either they can help us, or we can help them. The purpose of seeking companions is so that we may know more of Christ and let Him live in us. Hence, we should not make friends with those who enjoy the world&rsquo;s pleasures, because instead of helping us to live in Christ, they will pull us to follow Satan and to take him as our life. We must pay attention to this point when we look for companions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Looking for Three Kinds of Companions</h2>
<p>Third, we should look for three kinds of companions. The first kind should be those who are at our spiritual level. This kind of friend is for mutual help&mdash;we can help him, and he can help us. The second kind should be more experienced in the Lord; he can lead us. We need to listen to such a one and receive his help, be restricted by him, and even be subject to him. I believe that Paul was such a companion to Timothy and to Titus; Paul was like their father. For this reason, Timothy and Titus had to learn submission, and they had to subject themselves to his authority (1 Tim. 1:1-2; Titus 1:4). We should also look for this kind of companion. The third kind of companion should be one who is younger and weaker. We should render him help and lead him like a big brother leading his younger siblings.</p>
<p>We should have these three kinds of companions. It is best for every believer to have two companions who are at the same level, a companion who is younger, and a companion who is older. The brothers should look for companions among the brothers, and the sisters should look for companions among the sisters. They should look for all three kinds of companions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CAUTIONS CONCERNING<br />
LOOKING FOR SPIRITUAL COMPANIONS</h2>
<p>We would like to fellowship some more with regard to the cautions one should heed when looking for companions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fearing God</h2>
<p>When the young brothers or sisters become companions, they must learn to fear God. We should never become so familiar with one another that we become loose, saying things or doing things that show no fear for God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Respecting One Another</h2>
<p>Under the fear of God, companions should also respect one another. We should avoid jesting and being loose because of familiarity. Being careless in our speech and our actions, such that the fear of God and our mutual respect are missing, will open a big door for Satan. Not only the young ones but even the older believers should not become relaxed concerning these two points. When I am with brothers and sisters and notice some kind of looseness, I immediately shut the door by becoming serious. It is right to be friends, but we should neither sacrifice the fear of God nor lose our respect for one another. If at any time we become so familiar with a particular companion that we lose the fear of God and become wild, loose, or relaxed, we should stop immediately and cut off that companionship. We must be on guard.</p>
<p>I have a very intimate friend who went to be with the Lord. Having been friends for twenty years, we knew each other very well, understood one another, and were in one accord. However, the Lord can testify that when we were together, we did not jest. Sometimes we might say a few words of humor, but we never engaged in frivolous, irreverent, self-indulgent, or careless speaking. We always had an atmosphere of fearing God. For this reason, for twenty years our friendship did not have any problems. I wrote the hymn &ldquo;Rest in the Lord&rdquo; when he passed away. We came to know each other after we were saved. I chose him as my companion, and he also chose me as his companion. For twenty years we walked before the Lord together. Our friendship gave us only benefits because we did not lose our fear of God; instead of being loose, we always respected each other.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Rejecting Natural Affection</h2>
<p>We should also guard against having natural affection, natural love. As companions in the Lord, we should love one another, but we should kill any natural affection. Natural affection is to be excessive in our love for one another. Natural affection is harmful, and it offends the Lord. We should love one another in the Lord, but we should not bring in any natural affection.</p>
<p>It is rather difficult to love without having natural affection. However, if we cannot restrain ourselves in this matter, our friendship will become a trap, and we will become loose. Anyone who cannot restrain his natural affection is also an unrestrained person before the Lord. We should be strict and restrained before the Lord in order to love our brother but reject natural affection. This also applies to the sisters. The sisters should love one another, but they should be restrained and not exercise natural affection. Friendship in the church is different from friendship in the world. People in the world love others in the realm of natural affection. But having more natural affection than love is often harmful. The brothers or sisters should love one another without natural affection. Our love must be in the Lord without any natural human affection. If we can know the difference between love in the Lord and natural affection and can guard against the exercise of natural affection, our companionships will be profitable, and we will not incur any loss.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURSUING TOGETHER WITH SPIRITUAL COMPANIONS</h2>
<p>I hope that the young saints will find three to five spiritual companions among the brothers and sisters in order to pursue the Lord together. On one hand, we should fear God and respect one another, and on the other hand, we should love one another and forsake natural affection. It is good to come together often in order to fellowship, pray, read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, and learn spiritual lessons together. When we encounter difficulties or problems, we should bear one another and solve the problems together. Then our living will be according to the principle of the Body. The results and the benefits of such a living are unlimited. The breadth, length, height, and depth of Christ, His unlimited fullness, will be opened to us and will flow unceasingly into us. Furthermore, we will grow speedily in a balanced and steady way.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 32</div><br></body></html>
