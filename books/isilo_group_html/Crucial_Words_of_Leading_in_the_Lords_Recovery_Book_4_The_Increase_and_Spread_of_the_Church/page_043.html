and the Life-studies</h2>
<p>In 1974 I received a burden to write footnotes for all the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. I added footnotes to verses that, according to my own experience, were difficult to understand, difficult to expound, and profound in terms of the revelation of truth. At the same time, I felt that I should give messages to present the main points of each book as they related to the experience of the divine life. Since 1974 we have conducted bi-annual trainings in the United States to release messages on every book in the New Testament. These messages have spread throughout the earth. After eleven years and twenty-two trainings, in 1984 the translation of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament was completed and published with footnotes, outlines, and cross references. In addition, Life-study messages of each book have also been published.</p>
<p>Over the past one thousand years, many books related to the New Testament have been published, and we have spent much time studying the important books; nevertheless, many of the published books do not provide much help. We have gathered together the main points from the important books and, using simple words, included them in the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament. Hence, as long as a person reads the footnotes and the Life-study messages, all the riches we have received will be displayed before his eyes. It is easy to understand the New Testament with the footnotes and Life-study messages.</p>
<p>The whole set of the Life-study of the Bible has approximately one thousand two hundred messages, and each message is about ten pages long. Altogether, there are over twelve thousand pages, and it is quite profitable to read them. I hope that all the churches would utilize the Recovery Version of the Bible and the Life-studies to teach the truth to the saints. I often tell others that if I could have been introduced to the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-study of the New Testament sixty years ago, I would have spent much time to enter into them. If you are willing to spend eight hours a day for pursuing, you will be able to read the New Testament very thoroughly in two years. If you do not have eight hours, it is all right to spend four hours. The brothers and sisters who are consecrated as full-timers must spend fours hours a day to fully get into the Recovery Version and the Life-studies. In this way, after four years you will enter into the revelation of the New Testament. Then everyone will be able to teach others and speak with inspiration for God to others, that is, to prophesy. With so many prophets and teachers, the churches in all the localities will be in a glorious condition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS BEING<br />
IN THE NATURE OF HOME NURTURING</h2>
<p>Small group gatherings are in the nature of home nurturing. The number of people who can gather in a home is usually not very large, and it is always sweet to get together. Therefore, we have a burden to establish the small group gatherings. We should learn from the Lord&rsquo;s way and have a maximum of twelve in a group. When there are more than twelve in a group, they should be divided into two groups. Since the number of people in a small group gathering is small, the nature of the meeting should be to nurture the saints. Rather than emphasizing the truth, the focus should be on nourishing, fellowshipping, shepherding, supporting, caring, and bearing one another. Both educational and nurturing meetings are necessary.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ARRANGEMENT OF EDUCATIONAL<br />
AND NURTURING MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Joint Meetings for Education</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Supplying Life by Releasing the Truth</h2>
<p>The educational aspect of a joint meeting can be carried out with two kinds of meetings. The first kind supplies life by releasing the truth, and the second kind teaches the truth by expounding the Bible. The first aspect of education can be accomplished by nourishing the saints with a life message at least once a week. Such a message cannot be without foundation; it must be a living message, based on the pure word of truth, and be full of the light of life and the supply of life. All the saints will feel very satisfied after such a meeting. According to my experience over the past decades, the best time for such a meeting is from 10:00 to 11:30 A.M. every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. Today in countries throughout the world, Sunday is a day of rest&mdash;schools have no classes, factories are closed, and many commercial businesses are not open. Thus, the brothers and sisters have time to listen to this kind of message. Therefore, we should have ample time for a meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. If the starting time is too early, it will create difficulties for the saints. It also should not be too short so that there will be ample time for the release of the truth. Moreover, there should be time for the saints to share and give testimonies. All these matters should not be carried out in a hurried atmosphere so that every saint will receive help, light, and the life supply. These meetings cannot be conducted in a small group gathering; they should be held in the various meeting halls, and the messages should be released, in rotation, by brothers who can minister the word.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 4: The Increase and Spread of the Church &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
