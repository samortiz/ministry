[1]  The teaching of the apostles is the unique divine revelation of God's New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem, carried out by the full ministry of Christ in three divine and mystical stages for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy: The first stage, the stage of incarnation, is for Christ to bring God into man, to express God in humanity, and to accomplish His judicial redemption.
[2]  God's economy is His household economy, His household administration, which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church, the Body of Christ.
[3]  This is accomplished by creating man in His image and after His likeness Gen 1:26-27 , becoming a man in His incarnation to partake of the human nature Heb 2:14a , living a human life to express His attributes through man's virtues, dying an all-inclusive death, resurrecting to become the firstborn Son of God and the life-giving Spirit Rom 8:29; Acts 13:33; 1 Cor 15:45 , dispensing Himself into His chosen people to regenerate them with Himself as their life for producing many sons 1 Pet 1:3 , forming the churches with His many sons, and building up the Body of Christ with His brothers as the members to be the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God to consummate the New Jerusalem as His eternal enlargement and expression.
[4]  of God's New Testament Economy Christ has the preeminence, the first place, in all things Col 1:18: Christ has the preeminence in the Triune Godhead the first, the Father, always exalts the Son, and the third, the Spirit, always testifies concerning the Son Phil 2:9; John 15:26: Christ has the first place in all things; for in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell Col 1:18b-19.
[5]  Message Six The Full Ministry of Christ in Three Stages
[6]  Incarnation, Inclusion, and Intensification The first stage of the full ministry of Christ is the stage of His incarnation, the stage of Christ in the flesh, from His human birth through His human living to His death: In His incarnation, Christ brought the infinite God into the finite man; He also united and mingled the Triune God with the tripartite man.
[7]  In His human living, Christ expressed in His humanity the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues: Christ expressed the bountiful God in His human living, mainly expressing God in His rich attributes.
[8]  The second stage of the full ministry of Christ is the stage of His inclusion, the stage of Christ as the life-giving Spirit, from His resurrection to the degradation of the church: In His resurrection, Christ was begotten as God's firstborn Son Acts 13:33: From eternity past without beginning, Christ was God's only begotten Son, possessing only divinity, without humanity, and not having passed through death into resurrection.
[9]  In His resurrection, Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b: Christ, the Son of God as the second of the Divine Trinity, after completing His ministry on the earth, became was transfigured into the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection.
[10]  This life-giving Spirit who is the pneumatic Christ is also called the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , and the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .
[11]  The third stage of the full ministry of Christ is the stage of His intensification, the stage of Christ as the sevenfold intensified Spirit, from the degradation of the church to the consummation of the New Jerusalem: The first thing which Christ is doing in the third stage of His ministry is to intensify His organic salvation: On the way of Christ's ministry in the stage of His inclusion, which is to carry out His organic salvation for the producing of the church and the building up of His Body to consummate the New Jerusalem, the church became degraded, frustrating the accomplishment of God's eternal economy.
[12]  The all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit of God with the element of divinity Gen 1:1-2; Matt 12:28; Rom 8:9; 1 Cor 2:11-12: In the phrase the Spirit of God, God is in apposition to Spirit; thus, the Spirit of God means that God is the Spirit and the Spirit is God.
[13]  in Which We Are Saved and in Which We Reign In our physical body we have a biological life Gk. bios , in our soul we have a psychological life Gk. psuche , but when we were regenerated we received another life, the eternal life Gk. zoe : The eternal life is the life that is not only everlasting but also eternal both in time and in nature John 3:16, 36; 1 John 1:2.
[14]  the Organism of the Triune God The vision of the Body of Christ: The goal of God's eternal economy is to create, to constitute, and to produce a Body for Christ, who will gain this Body, which is a part of Himself, to be His counterpart, His bride, and consummately the New Jerusalem.
[15]  The Body of Christ, a constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with the regenerated and transformed tripartite men, is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God and of the transfusing of the ascended Christ and the consummation of the ministering of the riches of Christ.
[16]  as Many Local Churches The church of God, as the universal Body of Christ, the universal house of God, and the kingdom of God Eph 1:22-23; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Matt 16:18-19 , is expressed practically as many local churches Rev 1:4a, 11 , and all the local churches, being the one Body of Christ separated by localities for their existence, express the same one Body, not respectively but corporately.
[17]  According to the divine revelation of the New Testament, the church ground is constituted of three crucial elements: The first element is the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ, that is, the oneness of the one Spirit as the unique essence of the Body, with the one Lord as the unique element of the Body, and with the one Father as the unique source of the Body Eph 4:4-6.
[18]  the Consummation of God's Eternal Economy The New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the entire divine revelation and the central and ultimate consummated significance of the entire divine revelation Rev 21:2, 9-10: The New Jerusalem is the conclusion and the total composition of the entire revelation of the Bible.
[19]  The New Jerusalem is not a physical city but an organic constitution constituted with the redeeming processed and consummated Triune God with the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man as an organism of the consummated Triune God for His eternal enlargement and expression through the glorified tripartite man: The New Jerusalem is the composition of all the Old Testament and New Testament saints built together as God's eternal building.
