[1]  The life of a Christian is the life of the altar and the tent.
[2]  The altar is toward God while the tent is toward the world.
[3]  In His presence, God requires that His children have an altar and on the earth that they have a tent.
[4]  God appeared to Abraham, and Abraham built an altar.
[5]  It was the kind of altar spoken of in Romans 12:1: "I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service."
[6]  Genesis 12:8 says, "And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord."
[7]  The altar led to the tent, and then the tent led again to the altar.
[8]  When we offer ourselves upon the altar and consecrate our all to God, He leaves certain things for our use; but we have no choice as to what we can keep in the tent and what we have to take out of the tent back to the altar.
