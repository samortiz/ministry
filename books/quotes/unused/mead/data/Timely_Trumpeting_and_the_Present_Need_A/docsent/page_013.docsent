   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Letters Written by the Apostle</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to the Church in Colosse and</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>to the Church in Laodicea Respectively</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>to Be Read and Received Interchangeably</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the end of the book of Colossians, Paul said, And when this letter is read among you, cause that it may be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the one from Laodicea Col 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although these were two separate churches in different localities, the teaching they received was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Apostles Teaching the Same Thing</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>in All the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the apostles taught in the various local churches, their teachings were all the same 1 Cor 4:17; 7:17; 11:16; 14:33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no such thing as having one kind of teaching in one place and another kind of teaching in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The apostles taught the same thing in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result, the churches that were produced, though different in affairs and practices, were the same in nature and form.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST A. For the Growth</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>of the Body of Christ Universally and</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having No Element of Political Organization</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our body there is no element of political organization.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If there were, we would be robots.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our organic body knows nothing about politics; it only knows how to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The same is true with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, the elders must drop all political or bureaucratic concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a problem arises, they should not merely consider ways of discussion or moderation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That is merely the way of politics and should not be adopted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The way that supplies the church is like the way a mother nurses her baby.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, she has to be well fed herself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then, she needs to digest the food into milk and feed her baby with it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same way, the elders have to be well fed themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After they have digested the food, they will be able to produce milk for supplying and nourishing the flock under their care.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way, the Body of Christ will grow universally.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not a bureaucracy; it does not have any element of organization or politics.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. Fully a Matter of the Growth</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>of the Saints in the Divine Life,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather Than the Membership Relationship</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>of a Human Organization</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is fully a matter of the growth of the saints in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no membership relationship of a human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In all human societies and communities, there is the need for discussion and liaison.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even with the pastors in Christianity, there is the need for social skill and affability.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If they do not have these qualities, they will not be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today in the Lord s church we do not need these kinds of things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since the church is the Body of Christ, everything must be of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Foremost in importance among all the Lord s people are the co-workers, those directly under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Next are the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These two groups of people are two crucial links.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the co-workers who are gifted are not up to standard, it is difficult for the elders to be up to standard.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>And if the elders are not up to standard, it is difficult to expect the saints to be up to standard, nor will it be easy for the church to be up to standard.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a result, it will be difficult to realize the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For this reason, the elders and co-workers have to take the lead to grow in the divine life, that the Body of Christ may be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>C. Ultimately for the Growth</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>and Maturity of the New Man,</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>unto the Measure of the Stature</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>of the Fullness of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The ultimate goal of the building up of the Body of Christ is the growth and maturity of the new man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Fullness here means expression.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be filled with the fullness of Christ is to be filled with the Body as the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This Body has a stature, and when the stature attains a measure, there is a full-grown man.</S>
