   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FAITHFUL TO THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In a previous message I pointed out that in 1934 Brother Nee gave a series of messages in Shanghai on the centrality and universality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At Brother Nee s request, I polished my notes of these messages and prepared them to be printed in Brother Nee s paper called The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When this material was translated into English, the translator took the liberty of interpreting Brother Nee s concept regarding Christ as the first of the creatures in a way to which Brother Nee would never have agreed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead of saying, as Brother Nee did, that the Son is the number one of the creatures, the translator says that the Son is the head of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Surely this is not a faithful translation, but an interpretation according to the concept of the translator.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Nee had the boldness to say just what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During that conference in 1934 we read from Brother Nee s Chinese translation of Colossians 1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this translation he made it very definite that Christ is the first of all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is an example of Brother Nee s boldness for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He did not care for what men say; he cared only for what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, the translator of these messages changed Brother Nee s words in order to avoid trouble with certain theological concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not faithful to Brother Nee s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we care for the truth, we shall testify that Christ, the image of the invisible God, the very Creator, as the firstborn of all creation, is the first among all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this sense, Christ is not only the Creator, but also part of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>IN HIM, THROUGH HIM, AND UNTO HIM</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Colossians 1:16 says, Because in Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Him means in the power of Christ s Person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All things were created in the power of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All creation bears the characteristics of Christ s intrinsic power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>See note on this verse in Darby s New Translation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through Him indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was processed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Finally, unto Him indicates that Christ is the end of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All things were created for His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BEFORE ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 17 Paul goes on to say, And He is before all things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates His eternal preexistence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>ALL THINGS SUBSISTING IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, verse 17 says that all things subsist together in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For all things to subsist together in Christ means that they exist together by Christ as the holding center, just as the spokes of a wheel are held together by the hub at their center.</S>
