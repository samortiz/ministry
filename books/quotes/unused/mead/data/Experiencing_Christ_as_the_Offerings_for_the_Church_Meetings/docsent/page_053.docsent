   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE REALITY OF THE FULFILLMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE TABERNACLE AND THE OFFERINGS Scripture Reading: John 1:1; 14, 29, 31-33; 3:5-6, 34; 4:14, 23-24; 6:63; 7:37-39; 14:16-20; 15:26; 16:13-15; 20:19-22</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some aspects of the truth concerning the matter of the meeting of God s people have been somewhat hidden and missed by Christians for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most Christian meetings today are mainly either traditional, natural, religious, or just according to people s taste.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If I am a person who likes to be quiet, I would attend a quiet meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I am a person who likes to be excited, I would attend some exciting meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>MEETING AS A FEAST UNTO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the previous thirteen messages we have covered three crucial and main points.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First of all those messages have opened the veil to show us that in God s redemption His intention is to have a people on the earth who are meeting as a feast unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Exodus 12:14 God ordained His redeemed people to meet together for a feasting unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means not only before Him, but also with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Feasting, of course, mainly implies two things: meeting and eating.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Firstly you need people coming together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You cannot have a feast by yourself or even with your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To have a feast you need to have a meeting, and the more people, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Also feasting implies eating.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you come together, but with nothing to eat, that is not a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That may be a kind of emptiness or vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When God s people came out of Egypt in the ancient time, there were probably two million.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When they came together to feast, what a feast that was!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a feast was unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means they feasted before God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today in the church meetings we are feasting before God and also with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we are feasting before the Lord, God is happy, and we also are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A DWELLING PLACE AND THE OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Secondly, for such a feasting meeting before God and with God there is the need of two things: a dwelling place and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the record of Exodus they were firstly feasting in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There were no houses or lodgings just wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So there was the need of a dwelling place, the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The tabernacle was the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God dwelt there, and His people also dwelt there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the picture presented in Exodus, while they were in the wilderness, the children of Israel were either traveling or camping.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When they camped, it was around God s tabernacle which was called the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There was the tent of meeting with all the camps.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their camping was also a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While they were camping, God was camping among them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As they were camping in the wilderness, they spent much time to build a wonderful tabernacle with all its furniture and utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That tabernacle signified not only Christ but also God s people in a collective sense to be a dwelling place for God and for all those who loved Him and served Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To enter into that dwelling place, there was the need of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The offerings were needed because God is God, and man is man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of the fall there is a gap between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need some offerings to bridge the gap, to bring us from the altar into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The main offerings, of course, were the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The subordinate offerings were the wave offering, the heave offering, the drink offering, the vows, and the free-will offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All these offerings are bridges to bring us to the other side, that is, into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>CHRIST BEING THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>AND ALL THE OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The third crucial point we have covered is that Christ, the incarnated God, is both the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One book in the New Testament, the Gospel of John, points out that the incarnated God, Christ, is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John 1:14 reads, And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father , full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In writing his Gospel John used the word tabernacled for dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He used the word tabernacle in the verbal form to denote what the incarnated God intended to do.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God incarnated intended to be the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before the incarnation God was invisible and mysterious, but after the incarnation, there was something solid, visible, and touchable the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As the tabernacle, Christ is enterable!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is not only visible, solid, and touchable, but also enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can walk into God as our tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I can testify that for so many years I have entered into God and even traveled in God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a wonderful fact!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The mysterious, invisible God became solid, visible, touchable, and enterable.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You can dwell in Him as the tabernacle and travel through Him day and night.</S>
