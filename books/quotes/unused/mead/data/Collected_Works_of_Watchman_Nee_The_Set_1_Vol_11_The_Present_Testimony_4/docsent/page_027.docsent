   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST IN REDEMPTION Christ Having the First Place in Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A few days ago we saw that "Christ is all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What God planned before the foundation of the world is "that He Himself might have the first place in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today we want to see how Christ's redemption accomplishes God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's plan has one goal with two aspects: 1 to have all things expressing Christ's glory, so that Christ may have the first place in all things, and 2 to have man conformed to Christ, having His life and His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Colossians 1 tells us these two things: 1 Christ has the first place in all things, and 2 Christ is the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians 1 also tells us these two things: 1 Christ is heading up all things in the heavens and on earth, and 2 the church becomes His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation 4 and 5 also tell us these two things: 1 chapter four speaks of creation, and 2 chapter five speaks of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's creation is for the carrying out of His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's goal in creating all things and man, is to have all things express Christ and to have man conformed to Christ, having His life and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, Satan rebelled and came in to interrupt, causing all things to become disjointed and causing man to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, God had to use redemption to achieve the goal of His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result, Christ's redemption must 1 reconcile all things to God, and 2 redeem fallen mankind and impart His life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To solve God's problems, Christ's redemption must also 3 deal with the rebellious Satan, and 4 take care of man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ's redemption indeed solved these four matters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It accomplished God's goals: 1 by reconciling all things to God, and 2 by dispensing His life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It also solved God's problems: 3 by dealing with the rebellious Satan, and 4 by taking care of man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Two are positive and two are negative.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ's Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Accomplishing God's Two Goals</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before the foundation of the world, the Father had a conference with His Son, in which He asked His Son to come as a man to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Redemption is not a temporary remedy that God made in time, but a plan according to His predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ did not come to the world to become a man according to Adam's image; rather, Adam was created according to Christ's image.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Genesis 1:26 is God's plan, while 1:27 is God's execution of His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 26 says that it is "Us" that plan, while verse 27 says God created according to "His" image.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 26 tells of the plan in the conference of the Godhead, while verse 27 tells of the creation of man according to the Son's image.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Within the Godhead, only the Son has an image.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Adam was created according to Christ's image.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That is why Adam is a type of Christ Rom 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ's coming to the world was not a temporary remedy; it was out of God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ was anointed before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the universal Man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is not limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the anointed One from before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is also the Christ who fills the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Bethlehem and Judea are both universal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only was Christ born in Bethlehem and baptized in the Jordan River; the universe was also born and baptized there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Christ in the Gospels should be considered as the universal Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first thing in Christ's redemption is His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ was incarnated to be a man in order to come from the position of the Creator to the position of the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He had to take on a created body before He could die for man and for all things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There must first be Bethlehem before there can be Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There must first be the manger before there can be the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1 Christ's redemption reconciled all things to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All things were created in Christ Col 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When God deals with Christ, He deals with all things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All things are dealt with by God in Christ, just as Levi had offered up tithes in Abraham's loins Heb 7:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ tasted death on behalf of everything Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the cross He reconciled all things to God Col 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The extent of Christ's redemption covers not only man but all things as well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All things have not sinned; therefore, redemption is not needed for them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The problem between all things and God is that they are not reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, they need only reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>2 Christ's redemption gives man His life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ's redemption not only reconciles all things to God, but also causes man to have life and to be like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Redemption releases His life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When Christ was on the earth, His divine life was restricted and confined to His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When He was in Jerusalem, He could not be in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ's death enabled this confined life to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"The grain of wheat" in John 12:24 is God's only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The life of this grain of wheat is confined to its shell.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If it does not fall into the ground and die, it will forever be one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If it dies, and its flesh is broken, the life within will be released, thus producing many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All these grains will be identical to that one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can also say that every grain is in that one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ died to reproduce us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Before His death He was the only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After His resurrection He became the Firstborn among many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ's resurrection regenerates us so that we can obtain His life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>"Fire" in Luke 12:49 refers to Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When Christ was on earth, His life was confined to His outer shell.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Through His baptism His death on the cross this confined life was released.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ's life was released and was cast on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After being cast on the earth, it was kindled.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This caused division on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christ's death is a great release of His life!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As a result of His death, His life was imparted to us.</S>
