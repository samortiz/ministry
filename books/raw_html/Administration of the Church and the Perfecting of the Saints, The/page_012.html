        <h2 class="head1">PERFECTING EVERYONE IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The elders should not administrate the church in the way that people do things in society. The church is not administrated in that way. In the church everyone who seems foolish in our eyes must be put to use; such a one can learn to wipe the chairs. The more foolish a person seems, the more we should welcome and treasure him. He may make a mess the first time he cleans the chairs, but we should not give up. We should teach him and ask him to clean the chairs again. If he does not succeed the first week, we can help him the next week. Although he learns things slowly, we must not put him aside, for once he knows how to do it, he will be faithful, and we can fully depend on him. Those who seem to be foolish do not play clever tricks and do not have gimmicks. We may need to spend four or five weeks to teach them, but they will save us much trouble in the future. Those who consider themselves smart like to play tricks. They may do a good job in our presence, but in our absence they will change everything we taught them. Therefore, the smart ones are not that reliable, but the foolish ones are. This is particularly true in the church. This might be the reason that the Lord does not save so many smart ones. The Lord does not have a way with those who consider themselves to be smart. Although the foolish ones learn things slowly, they are very reliable.</p>
<p>The local churches cannot be built up in a short time. If there are one hundred and twenty people in a locality, we will need at least three years to build up everyone and bring them into serving. The way to build up the church differs from the methods of society. Society depends on elections, and only talented ones can win elections. In the church everyone must be put to use. The more the elders ask the saints to bear responsibility and do things, the more involved the saints will be. When the saints do things in the church, they will be interested in the church, love the church, and care for the church, because they feel that they have a part in the church. If the elders do not let the saints do things, the saints will feel useless and indifferent and will lose their interest in the church.</p>
<p>We cannot build up the church with the methods used in society. The church and society are completely different entities. Smart ones cannot gain fame or profit in the church, and the Lord has saved many foolish ones. Therefore, the elders should not consider themselves smart. Those who are competent to be elders live in their spirit, pray at all times, and minister life. They are able to bring all the children of God, regardless of how foolish they appear to be, into serving, to teach and perfect them, and to commit things to them. By such a process both the elders and the saints will grow together in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING REALITY INSTEAD OF FALSE THINGS</h2>
<p>We also need to see that the church is built up by growing in life. Paul says, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 4:15). <em>Truth</em> here refers to the things that are true and real. We do not want false things or vanity in the church; we want only what is true and real. Caring for physical appearance, playing politics, and treating people not according to our spirit are false things. Therefore, we do not play tricks or politics. Paul also says, &ldquo;Having put off the lie, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another&rdquo; (v. 25). We do not care for false things, pretense, or methods. We should not treat others with hypocrisy; rather, we must hold to truth in love. Then we will grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWING UP INTO THE HEAD, CHRIST, IN ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>In the administration of the church the elders must always be genuine with one another and toward others; they must be without pretense. The elders must also grow up into Christ in all things, whether big or small. We were put into Christ when we were saved. However, we have not yet grown up into Christ in many aspects of our living. Hence, we need to grow up into Christ in all things. This means we should not do anything apart from Christ; we should do everything in Christ. We should not choose the color or style of our clothing apart from Christ. Before we were saved, we were outside of Christ and followed the trend and fashion of the world. Now that we are saved, we should buy our clothes in Christ, spend money in Christ, and do things in Christ. This is what it means to grow up into Christ in all things. Then we will experience verse 16: &ldquo;Out from whom [Christ] all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A crucial point in the administration of the church is that the elders must not give up on any brother or sister. Nearly every locality has neglected this point. When the elders pray and fellowship concerning the needs of the church, they discover that the church has many needs, but they cannot find the people who will serve. However, it is not that the elders cannot find people but that they cannot find the people whom they think are useful. There are many saints, but the elders feel that this brother is not qualified and that sister is not up to the standard. For example, the elders may want the saints to praise God but feel that no one is competent, because everyone seems to be either &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; or &ldquo;deaf.&rdquo; If all the saints are dumb, the elders should still pray and inquire of the Lord how to lead the saints. If the saints are incompetent, the elders should be constrained to pray. Then the elders will take the lead to grow in life. After the elders are dealt with by the Lord, they should ask for the Lord&rsquo;s leading and guidance. Although a dumb person cannot speak, he can use sign language. The brothers should then learn &ldquo;sign language&rdquo; in order to teach the saints how to praise God. In this way no one is set aside, but everyone is brought into function. This is the proper way to build up the church. In order to bring the saints into serving, the elders need to pray patiently and teach and perfect the saints. We must not give up on anyone, because the saints are children of God; they were created and redeemed by God. If God treasures them, how can we abandon them? If we as elders have the attitude of letting the saints go, after a few years there will be no one but the elders left to praise God.</p>
<p>In some local churches the elders put everything, including the keys to the meeting hall, in their pocket. As a result, no one functions except the elders. This is unacceptable. The brothers must remember that they should never put any brother or sister aside. It is a gross error to put the saints aside. To put the saints aside is to abandon God&rsquo;s creation and the Lord&rsquo;s redemption. God did not make a mistake in creating the saints, nor did the Lord make a mistake in redeeming them. Hence, we must bring all the believers into serving and perfect them to function. I can testify that if we know how to administrate the church, every saint will be precious. In the eyes of the outsiders, we are all foolish people who are cleaning the hall, and we are dumb ones who cannot sing but who use sign language to express our praise. In such a process of administrating the church, we will grow in life, and we will be able to minister life so that others may also grow in life.</p>
<p>The only way for the elders to minister life, to help others to grow in life, and to perfect others is not to consider anyone useless but to bring everyone into serving. Then the elders will have the way and will gain the experience. We will be the first to grow in life, and then we can help others to also grow in life.</p>
<p>It is our hope and prayer that some in every local church will rise up to lay a good foundation. This way may be hard initially, but eventually everyone will follow this way. In some local churches no &ldquo;graduates&rdquo; have been produced for many years, because the elders administrate the church in a natural way and have not learned this lesson. In a natural way we do not trust others, we think that we are the only capable ones, and we do everything ourselves. This way must change. We must not take the natural way. Instead, we should take the way that is based on the Word of God and bring the children of God, one by one, into serving so that they can function. If we do this for one day, we will gain one day&rsquo;s worth of learning, and if we do this for one year, we will gain one year&rsquo;s worth of learning. We will gain many experiences. If we will carry this out, those who come after us will spontaneously follow the same path. Although this is hard at the beginning, it will be easy for others to follow.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
