   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THINKING THE SAME THING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND REJOICING IN THE LORD Scripture Reading: Phil 4:1-4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In reading the Bible we should not take anything for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not take one sentence, or even a phrase or word, for granted, assuming that we understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we take things for granted when reading the Bible, we shall deceive ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In my reading of the Word I always exercise not to take anything for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In particular, I pay attention to those things which are rather puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before we go on to 4:1-4, I would like to point out some of the puzzling elements in 3:7-16.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>SOME PUZZLES IN PHILIPPIANS 3</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 7 Paul says, But what things were gains to me, these I have counted loss on account of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What does Paul mean by gains and by loss?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, why does he speak of gains in the plural and loss in the singular?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 8 Paul continues, But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them to be refuse that I may gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul s use of the word excellency is puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What does he mean by this word?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And what is the excellency of the knowledge of Christ ?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In reading this verse, many think of excellent knowledge rather than of the excellency of the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is a great difference, however, between excellent knowledge and the excellency of the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this verse Paul also speaks of suffering loss and counting certain things to be refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why does he use the word refuse ?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why does he not say, I counted them to be nothing ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, what is the difference between loss and refuse ?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 9 Paul says, And be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What does it mean to be found in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why does Paul not say known in Christ or seen in Christ ?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why did he use the word found ?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 10 says, To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have pointed out that to know Christ means to experience Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why does Paul not use the words enjoy and experience here?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We also need to pay more attention to the expression the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not believe that we yet have an adequate definition of this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should also inquire about the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To what does this refer?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may say that the fellowship of Christ s sufferings denotes our participation in these sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But what does Paul intend by the word fellowship here?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, why does he use the word conformed ?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to study carefully Paul s word about being conformed to Christ s death and solve the puzzle raised by this expression.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 11 Paul continues, If by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul s use of the term out-resurrection is puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even the words by any means require careful consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 12 Paul says, Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why does Paul use the word obtained here instead of gained ?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Also what does he mean by laying hold of that for which he had been laid hold of by Christ Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All these matters are puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verses 13 and 14 Paul goes on to say, Brothers, I do not yet reckon myself to have laid hold, but one thing forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What does Paul mean by the word reckon here?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Also we need to ask how it is possible to forget the things behind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It seems we can forget things only when we do not want to forget them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But when we try to forget something, we remember it all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How then are we to understand Paul s word about forgetting?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Can we forget our national characteristics, when they are with us wherever we go?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul s expression stretching forward is also unique and worthy of close examination.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What does it mean to stretch forward to the things which are before?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We also need to ponder the goal and the prize in verse 14, not assuming that we have a full understanding of these two items.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We also need to consider Paul s word concerning the high calling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why does he not speak of the calling from above or the calling from the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why does Paul say that the high calling of God is in Christ Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Why does he not say that it is in Jesus Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, why does he put the title Christ before the name Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Surely the order is significant and meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Moreover, why does Paul speak not of the high calling by God, but of the high calling of God?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some may say that this is simply a matter of idiom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But this does not resolve the puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Greek Paul could have said it either way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There must be a reason he said of God here and not by God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we ask questions such as these, we shall learn not to take things for granted in reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As we read the Word, we need to realize how little we actually understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Verse 15 continues, Let us therefore, as many as are full grown, have this mind; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Why does Paul use the term full grown ?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This expression signifies life, for anything that grows must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although we may have some understanding of the expression full grown, it is still rather puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In verse 15 what does Paul mean by this mind and by otherwise minded ?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>These simple words convey important concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Finally, in verse 16 Paul says, Only this, whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What is the meaning of only this and of whereunto we have attained ?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In this verse almost every phrase is a puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Bible is God s word; it is the divine breath, the breathing out of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thus we should not read it the way we read a newspaper or magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Instead, we should not take anything for granted, but, by asking questions, earnestly seek out the meaning and significance of the words, phrases, and sentences of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we pay attention to all the puzzling elements in 3:7-16, we shall receive more spiritual riches.</S>
