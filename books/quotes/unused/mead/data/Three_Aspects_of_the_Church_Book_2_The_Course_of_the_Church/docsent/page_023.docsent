   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How to Be an Overcomer</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to see what the Lord says concerning the church s overcoming in the seven epistles in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recovering the First Love for the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first epistle the Lord asks the overcomers to recover or keep their first love for the Lord 2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the order of the seven epistles, the desolation of the church began with losing the first love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Initially, the church s love toward the Lord was fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Out of this fresh love, the church followed and served the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, at a certain point in time, the church lost its first love for the Lord, although it was still zealous in works and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because the first love was lost, there was a problem in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the first epistle to Ephesus, we see the tree of life v. 7 and the lampstand v. 5 . Because the church lost its first love, it had a problem in life, and the light of its testimony was no longer clear.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the lampstand was removed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church was in a condition of desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since this is the first epistle, it is a record of the beginning and cause of the desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This beginning, this cause, was the losing of the first love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the overcomers must constantly maintain their love for the Lord in the desolation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The world, fame, and position are not the only things that can cause us to lose our love for the Lord; even the blessings God gives us or the work in our hands can cause us to lose our love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the result when a work is not done out of love for the Lord or if the fellowship in love with the Lord is lost during the course of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are like this, we are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All our work should be a matter of love between the Lord and us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We preach the gospel because we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because we have a fresh love for Him, our gospel work does not replace the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We build up the church because of our fellowship of love with the Lord; we administrate the church in a proper way because there is a story of love between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our love to the Lord we administrate His church and preach the truth to the saints for their edification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our work and service should issue out of our love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many among us have experienced working for the Lord without loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not make our service a profession.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We make our service a profession when we lose our first love toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A nanny feeds children in the course of her profession, but a mother feeds her children out of love instead of professional duty.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our preaching of the gospel is just a duty, we have fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It should not be a matter of duty but of love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every morning we should fellowship with the Lord in love, with a feeling of love, the love of the bridal days Jer 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must turn afresh to the Lord and renew our consecration to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should say, Lord, I love You in the same way that I loved You on the day I first met You.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our relationship is as it was in the bridal days.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is what the book of Jeremiah says about the love of the bridal days.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The losing of the first love in the epistle to Ephesus is the same as the Israelites losing the love of their bridal days for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to be overcomers in the desolation of the church, we must maintain our fresh love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every day we must say, O Lord, our relationship is like that of a newly married couple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lord, I have a fresh heart for You, a fresh hope in You, and a fresh turn to You.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, I also have a fresh enjoyment of You and a fresh knowledge of You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then such a love will motivate us to do His work; this is to be constrained by the love of Christ 2 Cor 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the elders administrate the church, they should pour themselves out for the saints because they are constrained by the Lord s love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not pour ourselves out for His church, God s heart will not be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What makes God s heart the happiest is the building up of His church; God loves and treasures the church more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because we love Him and care for His heart s desire, we are willing to sacrifice everything for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the first requirement for being an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should search our hearts to see whether our work has become a profession.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we administrate the church, are we doing something merely out of duty?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we serve the church, are we doing it merely out of diligence?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If this is the case, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When others contact us, they should sense that we have a fresh love toward the Lord and that we have freshly tasted the Lord s love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The only motivation behind our daily living should be our love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should be for the church, for sinners, and for the Lord s way because we have a strong love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because Lord s loveliness has deeply touched and attracted us, we have no murmurings or other motives.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All our labor and actions come out of this love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Others can sense when we are in such a loving condition, and we ourselves know it even more.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When such a person gives a message, he will sense not so much that Jesus is the Lord but that He is the lovely One.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The relationship of such a person with the Lord is not one of servant and master but one of mutual love.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should have prayers before the Lord that are not begging prayers but more like a loving consultation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We may say to Him, Lord, I like this; how do You feel?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I want to know if You like it too.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I do not want Your commandment; I want to know Your heart, and I want to live in the feeling of Your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do not want You to give me a command; I want to know Your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Lord, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every servant of the Lord should be a lover of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If a servant of the Lord is not like the Shulammite in the Song of Songs, he has a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, the first requirement for overcoming is to have a fresh love for the Lord and to maintain the first love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If our work is blessed or if we become a famous preacher in Christianity, we are in danger of losing our love for the Lord without having any feeling about it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>That is a dangerous situation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we treasure our position or the blessing on our work more than we treasure the Lord Himself, we will lose our fellowship in love with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many famous preachers today have fallen into this trap.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should not care to be a person who works for the Lord, a person of great renown, or a person whose work is effective; rather, we should care to be a person who loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everything we do in our service, work, and meetings should have the flavor of the loving virgins in Song of Songs 1:3.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This flavor indicates a proper condition.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A church without this flavor is in the desolate condition of Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The service of the deacons in the church office should give people a sense of love for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the deacons give people only the sense that everything is orderly and that the work is carried out diligently and thoroughly, the office is merely a place of business.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The office should manifest love; it should be filled with love.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The serving ones should cause others to touch the love of Christ, and they should touch the saints love for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our service should cause others to touch love, and we should have a fresh love for the Lord.</S>
