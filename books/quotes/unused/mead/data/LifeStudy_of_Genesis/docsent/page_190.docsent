   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Enosh's Way of Calling</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The third godly way that Noah inherited was Enosh's way of calling on the name of the Lord to enjoy all that He is 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was an addition to the first two godly ways.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was not only a matter of being saved or of pleasing God, but of participating in and enjoying what God is by calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may partake of the riches of God by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Noah must have practiced this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the Fathers' Way of Living and Begetting</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Noah also inherited the way of living and begetting 5:3-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Noah, like his forefathers, was not idle, but was living with a purpose for God and begetting children for man's proper multiplication that God's purpose might be fulfilled on this earth through mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Enoch's Way of Walking with God</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Noah also inherited the fifth way, the way of walking with God 5:22, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How good it is that a fallen man can walk with God!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although it is marvelous to see that a fallen man can be saved, we must further realize that such a person can walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the seventh human generation, Enoch discovered the way of walking with God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can be saved, please God, call on His name, live and beget, and walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What else do we want?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems that we have been fully satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are saved; we can please God; we can call on His name to enjoy all that He is to us; we can live with a purpose and beget, that is, bear fruit, for God's multiplication; and we can walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What do we lack?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are pleased and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, God has not been satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the burden that the Lord has shown me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is inadequate simply to see that Noah inherited all the godly ways of his forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If this ministry only helps you to see this much, it has failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must see something more.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>B. Receiving More Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God gave Noah what was nearly an all-inclusive revelation, a further revelation which none of Noah's forefathers saw.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although Enoch prophesied that when his son Methuselah died the deluge would come the meaning of the name "Methuselah" , and that God's judgment would be executed upon the corrupted earth, and although he even prophesied about the Lord's coming Jude 14 , Enoch never received the vision of the way that God would terminate the corrupted generation and bring in a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>None of Noah's forefathers saw this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One day, God came to Noah and revealed it to him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result of this, Noah's view of godly things was greatly broadened, and he saw much more than all his forefathers did.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He saw the vision and received a definite revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all need such a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In principle, our situation is exactly the same as Noah's. Today's generation is corrupt, and the earth is filled with evil and violence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It seems that, according to man's concept, God has been defeated and driven out of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, do you not realize that today there is a big "but"?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some dear ones have inherited all the godly ways of the saints from the first century of the Christian era until the present.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have inherited all the godly ways that were exercised in the past centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But should we stop here?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Should we say, "Look at what we have"?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No. Although we have inherited so many godly things and are satisfied and contented, how about God? How about God's purpose? God needs to terminate this age.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He needs a change of generation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He needs an ark that can bring His people out of this generation and start a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God needs an ark.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have seen this and I cry out for this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Have you been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do you have a way to please God?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thank the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Can you call on His name to partake of His riches?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since 1967, we have practiced this matter of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Are you living and begetting?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yes, day by day we are living for the Lord and are begetting for the Lord's multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are you satisfied?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hallelujah, we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But what about God and His purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do you realize that God intends to terminate this generation and bring in another age?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order to do this, He must have an ark.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot build the ark by our imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Like Noah, we must receive a revelation concerning God's need of the ark.</S>
