   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has been shuttling between Ch'ang-Teh and Yi-Yang, and he knows the condition in that area firsthand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He and I have been seeking the Lord's guidance in oneness concerning the way to distribute the money you sent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was filled with thanksgiving to the Lord when Brother Kuo related how the saints from Ch'ang-sha escaped from danger.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sister Chao Shi-chi intended to stay in Ch'ang-sha but eventually left with Brother Yen Wen-shiang's family.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We heard that the bombing in Ch'ang-Teh was quite devastating.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nothing has happened where I am.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In particular, the neighborhoods around the homes of Brothers Shang, Liu, Yang, and Shen have been burned because of the bombing, but the burning stopped at their doorstep.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord is truly the refuge to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Yang Dai, December 14</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I intended to send money through Brothers Liu Ai-Wu, Yang Dai, and Zhang Gun-jih to be distributed to saints in difficulty throughout Hunan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, Brother Liu has gone to Ch'ang-Teh, and Brother Zhang has gone to Dong-Ping in An-Hwa.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother Yang moved into the countryside sixty miles from the city of Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thank the Lord, I met a Mr. Lung Rong-hwa of the Lutheran Church on my way from Ch'ang-Teh to Ch'ang-sha, and he was willing to send the money to his home.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By the time I reached his home, I was able to cash it back.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I had not intended to involve myself in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As I walked back to Ch'ang-sha the next day, there was a storm on the way, and it was difficult to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I returned to Lung's house and left my belongings there, choosing instead to walk to Brother Yang's place which was sixty miles from Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was happy to see him and his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we talked about the money, Brother Yang suggested sending it to Ch'ang-Teh to let Brother Liu decide on its use.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I felt that this was not the right thing to do, and I advised Brother Yang against it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The instability of the political situation has caused mail correspondence to become extremely unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A letter from Ch'ang-Teh to Tao-Yuen, which is only sixty miles away by road, takes a week to get there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the brothers did not see each other, the mailing back and forth could take more than a month, not to mention the loss in postal fees.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even if the money arrived in Yi-Yang, I was not certain that there would be anyone who could distribute it to the countryside.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why I persuaded Brother Yang to distribute the money immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Yueh-Yang capitulated, all the brothers who had jobs before the city capitulated were given two or three months' salary in advance before they dispersed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some brothers are still drawing a salary even now.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, they do not have much need.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the great fire in Ch'ang-sha, most of the brothers and sisters left.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only four sisters who worked at an orphanage of a Westerner remained.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although the orphanage was burned, the livelihood of the four sisters was taken care of by the Westerner.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The ones who are finding it difficult to make ends meet are the saints who have escaped to Yi-Yang, An-Hwa, Ch'ang-Teh, and Yuan-Ling with a few poor local ones .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their suffering is untold.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the past they have always been distributors of money to others, taking care of others rather than meeting their own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I found out their true condition and after much prayer, I had to give the money to them, according to their practical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yueh-Yang capitulated, and Ch'ang-sha was burned, but the Lord's children left in time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one was stuck.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord has been gracious to His children.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brother Kuo Jen-yung, December 14</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brother Kuo, we thank the Lord for the way the money was distributed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From this matter we see that our God never delays!</S>
