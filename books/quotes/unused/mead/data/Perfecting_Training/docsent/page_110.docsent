   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT INSTRUCTIONS BUT A DESCRIPTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Have you noticed that Romans 8 doesn t seem to give us any definite instructions?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is no instruction but a kind of description.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To say, There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, is not an instruction; this is a description.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Neither is this an instruction; this is a description.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Another description is in verse 4: That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 5 reads, For those who are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to spirit, the things of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 6 goes on to say, For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Again these verses are not a kind of instruction, but a kind of description.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A description is just a view.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You have to have a clear view.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Romans 8 is a clear view of the processed God who, after being installed into us, becomes the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This God now is the law that operates in us not by activities but by the natural principles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You need to see such a view.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A CLEAR VIEW</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Don t just try to learn the way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have mentioned many times before that when I was young I read a lot concerning the way to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, I discovered that none of those ways worked.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have one small booklet entitled A Simple Way to Touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We don t need another way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need the way of contacting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But Romans 8 doesn t give you a way; it gives you a clear view.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You must be desperate for a clear view.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must believe me that you don t yet have such a clear view.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I too was like this for years, and even now sometimes I m still like this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although I got the view sometime ago, occasionally it seems as though suddenly the view is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you are in the view everything is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you lose the view you become another person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You need a view.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You need a view to see that God has gone through all His processes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we are not in the age of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time God had gone through nearly no process.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By Abraham s time God was not incarnated; He simply was God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At David s time it was nearly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But today we are even much later than Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to realize that God has gone through all the processes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only has God done everything needed for our redemption, but He has also gone through all the processes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He has gone through incarnation, through human living, through crucifixion, through the tomb, through Hades, through all the things related to death, and He has entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today He is still in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is now the very God whom we serve and in whom we believe and who is now dwelling in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have such a God indwelling us as a law working by principles and not by activities.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is within us as the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The law within us is not the law of letters, nor the law of commandments, but the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Life and Spirit are the elements, the constituents, of this law because this law is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many things are included within this law: God s divinity, humanity, death, resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must have a clear view that such a God today is this law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such a God as a law doesn t work in us and for us by activities.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He does not work in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today He is the processed God as a law to you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Have you ever had a specific prayer to thank Him that He is now the law to you?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to have such a kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I m afraid we still pray in the old way asking the Lord for His help in our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We still ask the Lord to help us not to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means we still do not have the view.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The electricity has been installed, so there is no need to kneel down and pray to the power plant to do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need a view!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Of course, our habit is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are used to praying in that old way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since we became Christians we have been charged and taught and even disciplined to pray in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But it is so strange that although this chapter tells us that there are two intercessors the Spirit and Christ it doesn t charge us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But it shows us that we have two marvelous intercessors praying for us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because we have two such marvelous intercessors within us, we surely don t need to pray so much in that old way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do you really realize that you are in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And do you really realize that God has been installed into you as the law of the Spirit of life?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do you have such a clear view?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we could see such a view, we would realize we don t need to pray that much.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is working within us by a law, not by activity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What we need to do is to cooperate with Him.</S>
