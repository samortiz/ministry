	 <h2 class="head2">Abandoning the Old Ways<br />
and Adopting Scientific Ways</h2>
<p>Even though we are all burdened for the gospel in the schools, it is futile for me to explain how to spread the gospel in the schools. Instead, our concepts need to be changed. My fellowship can be compared to a coach teaching a team how to play basketball. The team must first learn how to dribble. In 1953 I held a training in Taipei and spoke on thirty points of character, which included being genuine, exact, strict, diligent, broad, and fine. I taught the saints, point by point, how to be proper persons. If we do not know how to be a proper person, we can never know how to do things, and if we do not know how to do things, we can never labor for the Lord.</p>
<p>There is a large fishpond in front of us, and the resources of the church, including the brothers and sisters, are rich. However, we should not think that this provision is sufficient in order for us to succeed in the gospel work in schools. We must find the right methods and not go according to our old ways. Those who have not learned how to play the piano can still play it, but they play in a natural way. Their way of playing is not appropriate; it is not melodious. When learning to play the piano, one has to learn the scales and practice for one to two hours a day. After several years of daily practice, a person can play melodiously. The sisters who play the hymns play in a proper way, without wild movements. Do we labor in a way that is similar to the way in which people who have taken lessons play the piano? Most of us labor in a natural way, without much learning. How can we expect such labor to bring results? How can we expect the church to be strong?</p>
<p>If you were to ask me to be the principal of an elementary school or a university, I can guarantee you that the school would close within three years. However, if I study education and apply scientific methods to running the school, nearly every parent would want to send their children to the school.</p>
<p>For the past decades we have not made much progress in the work concerning propagation or spread. Thirty-five years ago there were only four hundred saints on the island; in less than ten years the number increased to forty thousand saints in fifty localities. Twenty years have gone by since then. Frankly speaking, we are merely maintaining the old fa&#231;ade. We are not propagating or spreading. This must not continue.</p>
<p>In this day and age it is no longer acceptable to run a school according to the old ways. Sixty years ago I studied accounting in a professional school run by Americans. Then I worked as an accounting clerk for a Chinese customs office. Now even accounting terminology has progressed. Almost all the old accounting terminology in Chinese has been phased out. This proves that everyone seeks progress. The principles in accounting have remained the same, but the application has improved. This is also true in mathematics. The principles in mathematics have not changed, but the way mathematics is taught has changed. Even the elementary school textbooks have changed. No one can change the fact that two plus two is four, but the way to teach this fact can be progressively improved.</p>
<p>Why have we not improved the way we labor? People are traveling in the 747 Jumbo Jet, but we are still riding on an ox cart. To continue in this way is to shut our doors, thinking that we are doing all right, without paying attention to the advancements all around us. Eleven years ago I began to devote all my energy to writing the notes for the New Testament and the Life-studies. After I finished the last book&mdash;the book of Acts&mdash;I said that I would return to Taiwan and begin the labor anew. The Lord has truly blessed the churches here with a good environment and rich resources. It is regrettable that we are holding on to the old ways and not making progress.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Studying, Laboring, and Improving</h2>
<p>We must take a new approach in the work and abandon the old ways. We need to study a new and scientific way to change the way that we labor and make progress. How can we achieve a tenfold increase on the campuses? We cannot guarantee that we will succeed initially. Only the Lord can create something from nothing; we cannot. What we can do is to study, to labor, and to improve daily.</p>
<p>I hope that the older brothers and sisters would be energized. We should not say that Brother Lee is developing some strange ways to lead us and that we did not do these things in the past. No one can guarantee that the way we take will have success, but we would like to see success. We do not want our rich resources to go to waste with no results year after year.</p>
<p>I have been in fellowship with the brothers in Taiwan for more than five years, and many matters have been brought up in my concern for the situation here. Now may the Lord cover me with His precious blood as I ask how we will proceed. We do not have any set plans. We only feel that our work needs to improve. Our maintaining the status quo year after year is hindering the Lord and His move.</p>
