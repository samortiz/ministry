<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH<br>AS THE ANOINTED OF JEHOVAH<br>AND THE ANGEL OF THE PRESENCE OF JEHOVAH<br>FOR THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL<br>UNTO THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 61:1-3; 63:1-6, 9; 64:1; 65:17-25; 66:15, 22</H1><P>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for Your mercy and grace that You have brought us to today. Lord, You know what we need. We thank You that we have gotten through all the points concerning Yourself as the all-inclusive Christ in Isaiah. Thank You tonight that You have brought us to the last message. Lord, bless us as You did in the past. We trust in You, in Your mercy, in Your blessing, in Your utterance, in Your speaking, and even in our being one spirit with You. Stand with us and speak in our speaking. Defeat the enemy and bless every attendant. Thank You. Amen.</P><P>In this message we want to see the all-inclusive Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in two aspects. First, He is the Anointed of Jehovah. This is a very precious term in the Old Testament. Second, He is the Angel of the presence of Jehovah. Some may think that to say "the Angel of the presence of Jehovah" is wrong. We may prefer to say "the Angel in the presence of Jehovah." But the text of the Scripture says "the Angel of His presence" (Isa. 63:9).</P><P>The most striking chapter on the Angel of Jehovah is Exodus 3. The Angel of Jehovah was the One who escorted the entire race of Israel out of Egypt through the wilderness and into the good land. Eventually this One, the Angel of Jehovah, is in Zechariah 1. He is the One who rides on the red horse, who was suffering with God's suffering people in order to serve them. The Angel of Jehovah served the children of Israel in their whole journey of forty years in the wilderness. In Exodus 14 we can see that He was taking the lead at the forefront. When the Egyptian army was chasing after Israel, the Angel turned to the rear (v. 19). He Himself protected Israel from the Egyptian army. That Angel of Jehovah was the Lord Jesus.</P><P>The last item of the all-inclusive Christ in the book of Isaiah is the Angel of, not in, the presence of Jehovah. His being the Angel of the presence of Jehovah means that He is the presence of Jehovah. Of indicates apposition. If I am with you, that means you and I are two persons. If I am of you, this makes us one. A husband may say that he is of his wife. That means that he and his wife are one. In the presence implies two persons. Of the presence means one person. The Angel of Jehovah is just Jehovah's presence. If I say, "the life in Christ," this means the life and Christ are two. If I say, "the life of Christ," this means the life is Christ. The Angel of the presence of Jehovah means that this very Angel is the presence of Jehovah.</P>
