   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING THE MANY GRAINS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO FORM A LOAF FOR GOD S FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND MAN S SATISFACTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In John 12:24 the Lord said, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Originally, Christ was the unique grain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, no one can make a loaf of bread with a single grain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A loaf requires many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One grain of wheat becomes many grains by falling into the earth and dying.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ needed to die so that He as the one grain could produce many grains to form the one loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ s death was necessary for the producing of the church, not merely because we, the chosen people of God, were involved with sins and the world and were troubled by Satan, self, the natural man, and ordinances, but because we needed to become the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The only way for us to be the many grains was for Christ to die so that He as the one grain could be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we, the many grains, are the members of the church and the constituents of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are no longer sinners or people of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are the many grains, which are good to form a loaf for God s food and people s satisfaction 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is what the church is, and this is what the death of Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The death of Christ has dealt with every negative thing and has produced the many grains for the one loaf, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must all see a clear vision that all the negative things that we were born into have been dealt with by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no longer anything negative to frustrate the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All these things have been abolished, slain, crucified, and dealt with thoroughly on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only so, but Christ s death has also made us the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are no longer sinners but grains good to form a loaf for God s food and man s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can test whether or not a group of Christians is the church by checking whether or not they satisfy people s inner hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the loaf, constituted of the many grains, can satisfy people s hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE CHURCH BEING THE MANY SONS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>AND THE MANY BROTHERS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THROUGH CHRIST S DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Early on the day of His resurrection, Jesus told Mary the Magdalene, Go to My brothers John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time Jesus called the disciples My brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers is a great title.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before His resurrection the disciples were His followers, not His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At best, they were His friends 15:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is because before Christ s resurrection the disciples were not yet regenerated; that is, they were not yet the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before His resurrection Christ was the unique grain, but after His resurrection this one grain became many grains, who are His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the unique grain, Christ was God s unique, only begotten Son 1:18 , but through His death and resurrection Christ became the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From eternity Christ is the only begotten Son of God, the second of the Triune God, in His divinity, but today He is also the firstborn Son of God with both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word firstborn indicates that many sons are following.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The multiplied grains produced by Christ s death and resurrection are the many sons of God Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today God has many sons, and Christ has many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John 20 we do not have the word church, but we do have the many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the evening of the day of resurrection Christ came to His disciples vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hebrews 2:11 and 12 refer to the same event.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These verses say, For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying, I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The brothers of Christ are the church, and the church is constituted with the many brothers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By this we can see that the church is produced by both the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are the sons of God and the brothers of Christ by His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE CHURCH S LIVING BEING NOT</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>IN THE NATURAL LIFE BUT IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church is not something natural; rather, the church is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before Christ s resurrection there was no church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church was produced through Christ s resurrection, and today it lives in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are still living in our natural life, we are not the church in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No doubt, we are still Christ s brothers, but it is only when we live in the resurrection life, denying our natural life, that we are in the church practically.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The death of Christ has abolished all negative things, and the resurrection of Christ has produced the many grains, the many brothers, and the many sons, who are the constituents of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, if we still live by our ordinances and natural ways, we are finished in relation to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may be a religious body or a social organization, but we are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church is an entity that has been delivered from all negative things and produced and built up in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To be the church in resurrection is not a mere term; it must be our situation in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Day by day we do not live in our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Instead, we walk, live, and have our being in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is not a mere doctrinal teaching; it is a matter of our real and living experience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some people have asked, How can you say that you are the church?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may illustrate the answer with a lamb and a turtle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A lamb has the life, nature, appearance, and living of a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If another animal has the appearance and living of a turtle, it must be a turtle, not a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This shows that in order to be the church, we must have the appearance and living of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must truly see that we have been regenerated and that all the negative things sins, worldliness, Satan, the flesh, the old man, the natural life, and all the ordinances have been dealt with on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must also realize that the church is not natural; it is altogether of and in the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must have our living in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christianity has become a religion of doctrines, and many in it do not care for the genuine experience of Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Recently, a brother testified that when he told his grandmother that she needed to have Christ in her heart, she showed him a crucifix that she was wearing and said that Christ was already on her heart.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the brother told her that Christ is present everywhere, his grandmother agreed and pointed to all her pictures of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This illustrates that Christians use the same terms that we do, but their lexicon is different.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Accordingly, the word church means one thing to us, but it means something very different to many other people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christianity has fallen into a religious condition, full of different doctrines, concepts, and opinions, and not many in it care for the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is why we are in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We do not care for religion or for different teachings, concepts, and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We care only for the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is our God, He is the Son of God, and He became a man to live on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He died on the cross for our sins, and He was resurrected physically and spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now the resurrected Christ is in the heavens, and at the same time He is within us to be our life and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, we care only for this living One.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We live by Him and in Him, and we come together to have the church life with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the situation in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We do not care for doctrinal teachings, organizations, rules, or practices.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have dropped all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We care only for the living Christ with the living, real, and practical church life, which is produced and built up by Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
