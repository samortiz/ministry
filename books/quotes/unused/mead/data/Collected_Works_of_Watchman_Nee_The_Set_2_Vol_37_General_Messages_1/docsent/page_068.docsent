   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR HE IS NOT WHO IS ONE OUTWARDLY,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT WHO IS ONE INWARDLY Scripture Reading: Rom 2:28-29; Gal 1:11-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should focus on a few expressions from the two verses we have read in Romans 2: "For he is not...who is one outwardly...But he is...who is one inwardly"; "in spirit, not in letter"; "not from men, but from God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here are a few contrasts: "outwardly" versus "inwardly"; "spirit" versus "letter"; and "from men" versus "from God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible shows us clearly through these contrasts the fact that Christianity is not a matter of outward regulations, forms, and ceremonies but a matter of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christianity is not an outward religion or a product of the human mind; Christianity is an inward revelation and a religion of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is it to be a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A Christian is one who has the life of the Lord within him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some people were baptized when they were young; they attend church services regularly and carry a Bible with them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They can recite the Lord's Prayer and know the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They can sing hymns and say amen to others' prayers, and they are very familiar with the stories in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They even consider themselves to be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But are they?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible says that "he is not...who is one outwardly."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, a Christian is not a Christian by teaching or by learning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A Christian becomes a Christian inwardly; he is a person who has the life of the Lord within him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus said, "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly" John 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A Christian is a person who has something to do with life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is not one outwardly but one inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Life comes from the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In fact, life is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A man receives this life through knowing the Lord Jesus and through knowing Him as the Son of God and as the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This knowledge comes from God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul had been instructed in the law according to the strict traditions of his fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He persecuted the church greatly and thought that by so doing he was zealously serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Lord appeared to him, he repented and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He testified in Galatians 1 that his gospel was not received from men nor taught by men; it came from the revelation of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a man has not received any revelation from God, his zeal is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He may be able to keep all the traditions of his fathers, but these traditions can never give him God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul did not become a Christian through men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He became a Christian because it pleased God to reveal His Son in him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once the Lord asked the disciples, "Who do men say that the Son of Man is?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They answered, "Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord then asked the disciples, "But you, who do you say that I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord immediately said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" Matt 16:13-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows us clearly that a Christian must be one who has received a revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you want to be a Christian, you must have this revelation and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you say that you admire the life of Jesus, this will not make you a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you say that Jesus' teaching contains some very deep philosophy, this will not make you a Christian either.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may not agree with this word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may argue: "I admire Jesus and honor Him; I am favorably inclined towards Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Does that not make me a Christian?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No, it does not.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Being a Christian is not a question of admiring or not admiring; it is not a question of being favorably or ill inclined towards Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some considered the Lord Jesus to be John the Baptist, Elijah, or Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Was not John the Baptist good?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Was not Elijah good?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Was not Jeremiah good?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet these were all man's views and man's opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christianity is absolutely not from man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, human views and human opinions cannot replace Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christianity is a religion of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only those who have received a revelation from God and who know the Lord Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, are blessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once a man receives a revelation, he touches the Lord Jesus in the Holy Spirit, and he comes face to face with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He has a direct relationship with Him and has made contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let me give a little illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once an electrical power line in a brother's home became worn out.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was easy to receive an electric shock from the wire.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The brother was not careful enough and touched the line.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Immediately he withdrew his hand and shouted, "What a shock!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What a shock!"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His young son saw how his hand stretched out and pulled back, and he imitated his father and pretended that he had been shocked also.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He stretched out his little hand and pulled it back shouting, "What a shock!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What a shock!"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But we know that the son was acting in an outward way; he was imitating.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The father was genuinely shocked by the electricity; he tasted the reality of the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Brothers and sisters, outward imitations do not count; it is the real taste that counts.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You must touch Christ like the brother who touched the electrical current.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do you know that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God today?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is not what men say, but what you say within yourself that counts.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You may not have any knowledge within you, and you may only have heard about Him from others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When others say that He is the Son of God, you echo and say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When others say that Jesus was a great social reformer, you follow suit and say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Your "faith" is one that revolves around others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I am afraid that you are not clear what you believe in.</S>
