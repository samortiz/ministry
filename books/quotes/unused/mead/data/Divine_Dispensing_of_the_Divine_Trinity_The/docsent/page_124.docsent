   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Comforted by the God of All Encouragement</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 3 Paul speaks of God as the Father of compassions and the God of all encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word rendered compassions also means mercies, pity, sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word rendered encouragement is different from the word for comfort or consolation and has the sense of cheer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such a title as the Father of compassions and the God of all encouragement is ascribed here to God because this Epistle is one of comfort and encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First we must experience the encouragement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we shall be able to encourage others with the encouragement we have experienced of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For many years I did not understand what Paul meant by encouragement in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some versions render the Greek word for encouragement here as comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to this translation, when we suffer persecution, God comforts us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our reading of the Bible, we should not take verses such as 1:3 and 4 for granted, assuming that we understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to ask ourselves what these verses mean.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In particular, we need to ask what it means to say that God encourages us in all our affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How does God comfort us when we are suffering because of the name of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I did not have a proper understanding of encouragement as described in this chapter until I came to realize that it is related to God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are comforted by God, encouraged by Him, through His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is dispensing Himself into us, and this dispensing is His encouraging, His comforting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I can testify from experience that the Triune God comforts and encourages us by dispensing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the years of the occupation of China by the invading Japanese army, I was imprisoned by the Japanese on two occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first time was in 1938, when I was in prison for one night; the second was in 1943, when I was held in prison for one month.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During my second imprisonment, twice a day I was subjected to a lengthy trial.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I was threatened and severely ill-treated, and I was exhausted physically and mentally.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although I had done nothing wrong, I was being persecuted by the Japanese army.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was persecuted simply because I was a preacher who was bringing people to Christ, and the Japanese army did not like such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Out of fear that I would have contact with others who would spread information, I was kept in solitary confinement whenever I was not being tried.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One night, after having suffered for days, as I was praying to the Lord, I said to Him, Lord, You know I m here.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I m suffering not because I have done anything wrong, but because of You and Your gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I certainly would not say that I saw or touched the Lord physically.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But I can testify that I experienced the Lord s presence in a remarkable way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seemed to me that when I told the Lord that I was suffering for Him and His gospel, the atmosphere in the room changed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord s presence was so real and intimate that I wept before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I knew that He was there with me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At that time I did not have the term divine dispensing, a term we have recently begun to use.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, I truly experienced the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through the Lord s dispensing, I was encouraged, comforted, and cheered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I was deeply at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I was in prison, I experienced the dispensing of the Lord into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That dispensing was His comforting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, I can testify that this comforting, this encouraging, is not a mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The real encouragement is the dispensing of the divine riches into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through that experience I eventually came to realize that the Lord s comforting is actually the dispensing of Himself into us to become our inward sustenance and support.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity can be compared to the flow of electricity from the power plant into our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the current of electricity flows, the appliances in our homes receive the power for their operation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the appliances operate, they continually receive the flowing, the dispensing, of electrical power into them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is an illustration of the dispensing of the riches of the Triune God into us.</S>
