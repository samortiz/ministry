   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b The Second Altar</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Abraham built an altar to the Lord at Moreh, he traveled through the land.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God did not give him just one little spot; He gave him a spacious land.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In his travels, Abraham came to a place that was between Bethel and Ai.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Bethel was on the west and Ai was on the east.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here, between Bethel and Ai, Abraham built another altar 12:8; 13:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Bethel means the house of God, and Ai means the heap of ruins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Bethel and Ai stand in contrast one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What does this contrast mean?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It means that in the eyes of the called ones only God's house is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything else is just a heap of ruins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The principle is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, we have Bethel, God's house, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Opposite to this is a heap of ruins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everything that is contrary to the church life is a heap of ruins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the eyes of God's called ones, everything other than the church life is a heap of ruins because the called ones look at the world situation from God's point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This point of view is absolutely different from the world's point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the worldly viewpoint, everything in the world is high, good, and wonderful, but, from the point of view of God's called ones, everything opposite to the house of God is a heap of ruins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Firstly, we consecrate ourselves at Moreh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we consecrate ourselves at the place that is between the church life and the heap of ruins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As far as we are concerned, only the house of God is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything other than this is a heap of ruins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Between the house of God and the heap of ruins we build an altar that we might fellowship with God, worship Him, and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>c The Third Altar</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abraham built the third altar at Mamre of Hebron 13:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mamre means strength, and Hebron means fellowship, communion, or friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Genesis 18:1, it was at Mamre that God came to visit Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In that visit God not only appeared to him but stayed with him for quite a long time, even feasting with him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We shall see more about this when we come to that chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although both Moreh and the place between Bethel and Ai were good, neither one was the place where Abraham stayed for constant fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The place where Abraham stayed for such constant fellowship with the Lord was Mamre of Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all need to maintain a constant fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This does not happen by accident; neither should it occur occasionally.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It must be constant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps some years ago you built an altar to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is good, but what has happened since then?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may say that you built an altar two years ago, but how about today?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many of us have had the experience at Moreh but have not had the experience at Mamre.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe that Abraham's life was mostly spent at Hebron, the place where he could have constant fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There, at Hebron, he built the third altar.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all need to build at least three altars: the first at Moreh, the second between Bethel and Ai, and the third at Mamre in Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to build an altar at Mamre in Hebron so that we may worship God, serve Him, and have constant fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the experience of the third altar, the altar in Hebron.</S>
