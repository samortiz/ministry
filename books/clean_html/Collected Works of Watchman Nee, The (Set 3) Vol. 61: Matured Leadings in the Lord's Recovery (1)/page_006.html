<h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD'S WILL</h2><p>Miss Lin Wei-shi: In the past I had many things to say when I prayed. Now I have very little to say. I am confused about God's will. My work supplies little life to others. I find it difficult to stop, yet I find myself too weak to work.</p><p>Watchman Nee: There are several steps towards knowing God's will. At the beginning of the Christian life, when a man seeks to know God's will, he may have a strong consciousness that God's will is this or that, but this is not altogether reliable. In the second step, God breaks down this so-called consciousness of God's will so that he begins to learn to trust by a faith that is independent of his own feelings. He has the faith that he is always in God's hand and that he will not be wrong under God's keeping power. He does not have to struggle to avoid making mistakes. If God is the preserving One in him, he will be right whether or not he feels that he is right. No matter how he turns, he can never depart from God's will. He is free from his own feelings, but there is still a long way to go. In our experience we should not be as foolish as a mule, but we should be like a maidservant looking at the hand of her mistress. Yet there are times when we have to go on like a mule. We have to exercise our faith at such times. The reins are in God's hand; He will check us and guide us. We cannot move by ourselves; we have to trust in the Lord all the time. We believe that we are in God's hand. If God does not allow it, we will never take the wrong path.</p><p>When a man learns to fly a plane, he must follow instructions blindly. If the instructor tells him to go up, he goes up. If the instructor tells him to turn left, he turns left. If the instructor tells him to turn one degree to the right, he turns one degree to the right. The instructor sees everything and knows how to fly. The student only needs to trust and obey. When he steps off the plane, he may say to himself with sweat on his brow, "I could have spared myself the suspense if I had made these judgments myself." But even if he knows the instructions, he still has to be fully at home with all the parts and instruments before he can fly the plane according to his own sight. Before that happens, he can only trust his instructor.</p><p>We have to learn to trust in the Holy Spirit's restraint. God can never be wrong. We may think that God is wrong in putting us in a certain environment, but eventually we will see that nothing is wrong. As long as life is released, nothing can be wrong. Any kind of environment can release God's life. This was Paul's experience. Whether he was in prison in Rome or in dire circumstances like those described in 2 Corinthians 11, he could equally claim that the Lord's grace was sufficient for him (12:9). Christ was manifested in him, whether through life or through death (Phil. 1:20).</p><h2 class="head1">FEELINGS AND FACTS</h2><p>Miss Lei: In the past I felt powerful when I spoke for the Lord, but now I do not feel that I have anything within me. I feel weak, and I do not have much to say when I pray.</p><p>Watchman Nee: This is not a problem. You only need faith. I believe you are very clear within that you do not have a problem in reality. You are merely going through a transition. Having nothing to say in your prayer may mean that you do not need to say much. Perhaps you only need more faith. You feel weak as if you are nothing. Perhaps God is reminding you that you need more faith. This faith will enable you to pray less strenuously.</p><p>A Christian should not be bound by his own feelings. He may feel that he does not fare better by praying and that he does not fare worse by not praying. Actually, prayer makes a great deal of difference. When a man knows God more, he will ignore finicky and fleeting feelings. We are communicating with the eternal God. We should not care for fleeting feelings. The facts are objective, while our subjective experience can be wrong. For example, every day we see the sun rising from the east and setting in the west. Actually, the sun never rises from the east or sets in the west. It is our subjective perception that tells us this. If we do not believe in the objective facts and pay attention only to the subjective experiences, we cannot be Christians at all.</p><p>If a scientist only pays attention to what he sees and ignores the facts behind a phenomenon, he is not qualified to be a scientist. The same can be said of a Christian. A Christian has to learn to constantly free himself from subjective feelings throughout his life. He should only believe in objective facts. We have to know that the objective things that our spirit touches are real, while the subjective feelings may not be real. We have to know facts and should not be led away by feelings. What is contained in Christ's salvation are facts. If we follow our feelings, we will find the way long and tortuous. We may search for years and still not find the way. If we do not see the facts, it will be hard for us to get out of this rut.</p>
