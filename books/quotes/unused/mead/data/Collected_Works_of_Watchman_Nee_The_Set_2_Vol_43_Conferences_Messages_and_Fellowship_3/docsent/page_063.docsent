   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GIVEN IN SHANGHAI, 1938 CHAPTER EIGHTY-FIVE CONCERNING MATERIAL OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Editor's Note: This is fellowship given by Brother Nee before a bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Date: Month unknown, 23rd, 1938</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Place: Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Scripture Reading: Heb 13:15-16; 1 Cor 16:1-3 SACRIFICE OF PRAISE AND SACRIFICE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>OF MATERIAL OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am not in Shanghai much of the time, and according to the words of a few brothers and sisters, the bread-breaking meeting here has not been very good.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I also feel the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, there are many reasons for this, and they may be quite complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But of all the reasons affecting the bread-breaking meeting, none is more serious than the one spoken of in Hebrews 13:15-16: "Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But do not forget doing good and sharing with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here two sacrifices are spoken of.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first is the sacrifice of praise, and the second is that of doing good and sharing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A sacrifice is something that is a loss to oneself and a gain to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A sacrifice of praise is a praise that is rendered to God at one's own loss.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A sacrifice of sharing or giving is giving something to God at one's own expense.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not have adequate praise in the bread-breaking meeting because we fall short in sharing and giving.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must give to the extent that we "feel" our giving.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, we have to give to the extent that we can sense the loss.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only this kind of offering can be considered a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we do this, we will spontaneously offer up the sacrifice of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we give in a casual way, our praise will not be high.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not have the sacrifice of giving, we will not have the sacrifice of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The apostle told us to offer up a sacrifice of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then he spoke of the sacrifice of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word "but" in verse 16 means that something will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In addition to the sacrifice of praise, there is still something that follows.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The phrase "do not forget" refers to the fact that it is most easy for men to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What should we not forget?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not forget doing good and sharing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the apostle explained, "For with such sacrifices God is well pleased."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The apostle considered doing good and giving as a kind of sacrifice, and he pointed out that they are sacrifices that are well pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise and giving are like two legs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If one is shorter than the other, we cannot expect a person to walk properly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Praise and giving are also like two wings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If one is missing, a bird cannot fly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It may still have one wing, but the wing is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A bird with only one wing cannot fly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we come to the meeting, we sometimes find superficial ones uttering a few words of praise, but their praise is never high.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE HEART BEING WHERE THE TREASURE IS</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our God is a rich God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He does not need our money.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The cattle of a thousand hills and the goats of ten thousand mountains are His.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the gold and silver are His.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then why does He need our money?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is because where our treasure is, there will our heart be also Matt 6:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Money is a material thing that belongs to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet the Bible puts God and mammon together.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This proves that man's heart is either touched by God or by money.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's test of a man's heart toward Him is in the way of man's giving.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I started working for the Lord sixteen years ago in 1922.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although I cannot say that my work has been perfect, I can say that all the shortages have been covered under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes I gave one-tenth, sometimes two-tenths, and sometimes five-tenths of what I received.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because there was never a steady flow of income, it was difficult to determine ahead of time how much I should give.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But I can say that the times when I felt the pain of giving the most were the times that my thanksgivings and praises were the loudest.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many brothers and sisters can testify of the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I despise anyone who says that he is living by faith, but who knows only how to receive but not to give.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes the best test of where a person stands is to consider his giving.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A worker of the Lord must give at least one-tenth, because the Bible shows us that the Levites had to tithe the same way as the rest of the Israelites Num 18:25-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a worker only expects to receive from others, and if he considers money as being such a big thing, it is better for him to not be a preacher at all.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, he should go to the world and take up a money-making profession.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Someone told me that sisters generally give more than brothers do.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The reason for this may be a failure on the part of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>One can speak on any subject comfortably; but when it comes to the subject of giving, many are hesitant to open their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Tonight I am forced to speak about it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is something I have wanted to say for many years but could not find the right opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Tonight I will grasp the opportunity to say something because I will be away again very soon.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Bible records the case of brothers stealing money and sisters offering money John 12:6; Luke 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is a shame to the brothers.</S>
