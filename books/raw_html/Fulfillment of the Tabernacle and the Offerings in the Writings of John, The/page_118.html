<h2 class=head2>For the Glorification of God the Father</h2><p>Christ’s all-inclusive death was also for the glorification of God the Father. In verse 28 the Lord Jesus prayed, “Father, glorify Your name.” This verse goes on to say, “There came then a voice out of heaven, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.” To glorify the name of the Father is to cause the Father’s divine element to be expressed. The Father’s divine element, which is the eternal life, was in the incarnated Son. The shell of the Son’s flesh had to be broken through death so that the Father’s divine element could be released and expressed in resurrection, just as the life element of a grain of wheat is released by the breaking of its shell and expressed by its blossoming. When the divine life concealed within the Lord Jesus blossomed and brought forth many grains, that was the glorification of God the Father, the glorification of the divine life.<p>We may use a carnation seed as an illustration of the glorification of the Father through the death of Christ. If a carnation seed is kept in a package, nothing will happen to the seed. But if the seed is sown into the earth, that seed will release the life that is within it. After this life has been released, it will grow and eventually blossom. The blossom will be the glorification of the carnation seed.<p>When the Lord Jesus was in the flesh, He was like a carnation seed. Others regarded Him as nothing more than a Nazarene, for they did not know that the divine life was within Him. In order for this divine life to be released from within the Lord Jesus, it was necessary for Him to die. His death and resurrection was the glorification of the divine life, and this glorification was the glorification of God the Father Himself. This was the reason the Lord Jesus prayed in verse 28 for the Father to glorify His name, that is, to glorify His Person.<p>When the Lord prayed for the Father’s name to be glorified, the Father answered that He had glorified it and that He would glorify it again. Through Christ’s all-inclusive death the divine life, the life of God the Father, was released. Then in Christ’s resurrection this life blossomed and was glorified. This is the glorification of God the Father, who was the divine life within the Lord Jesus.<h2 class=head2>For the Judgment of the World</h2><p>The Lord’s all-inclusive death was also for the judgment of the world. In verse 31 the Lord declared, “Now is the judgment of this world.” When the Lord Jesus was crucified, the entire old creation, including our old man and the satanic world, was crucified with Him. Hence, the Lord’s crucifixion was a termination of the satanic world. Therefore, in Galatians 6:14 Paul could say, “Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.”<p>Christ died an all-inclusive death. In the sight of God, that death may be compared to a great broom that God used to “sweep” the entire universe. Through the death of Christ on the cross, all the negative things, all the things of the old creation, were judged.<h2 class=head2>For the Casting Out of Satan</h2><p>In 12:31b the Lord Jesus said, “Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.” This indicates that Christ’s all-inclusive death was for the casting out of Satan, the ruler of this world. Satan thought that he was wise in having the Lord Jesus crucified. Actually, by doing this Satan caused himself to be destroyed. The cross was the way used by God to destroy Satan. Hence, through His death Christ destroyed Satan and his work (Heb. 2:14). Through His death on the cross Christ destroyed the Devil, the one who had the authority of death.
