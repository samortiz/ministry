<h1 class="title">The Will of God and the Building of God</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 7:21-23; 6:10; 12:50;<br />
16:18-19; 21:42, 44; 5:14</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In order to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the coming age, we must do the will of our Father in this age&mdash;Matt. 7:21-23; 6:10; 12:50; Rev. 4:11; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 1:5, 9, 11; 5:17; Col. 1:9; 4:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is a God of purpose, having a will of His own pleasure, and He created all things for His will that He might accomplish and fulfill His purpose&mdash;Rev. 4:11; Eph. 3:9-11; Col. 1:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s will is His heart&rsquo;s desire, His mingling with man, and the fulfillment of His eternal plan&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9, 11; 5:17.</li>
		<li>The will of God is to obtain a Body for Christ to be His fullness, His expression&mdash;Rom. 12:2, 5; Eph. 1:5, 9, 11, 22-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The kingdom is absolutely a matter of God&rsquo;s will and completely fulfills God&rsquo;s will; in fact, the kingdom is God&rsquo;s will&mdash;Matt. 6:10.</li>
	<li>The ultimate issue of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is the will of the heavenly Father&mdash;7:21.</li>
	<li>As the kingdom people, we are on earth to do the Father&rsquo;s will&mdash;7:21; 12:50.</li>
	<li>In order to do the will of the Father, we need to enter in through the narrow gate and walk on the constricted way&mdash;7:13-14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The narrow gate excludes the old man, the self, the flesh, the human concept, and the world with all its glory; only that which corresponds with God&rsquo;s will can enter in.</li>
		<li>As we walk on the constricted way, we are restricted by a mysterious, invisible, inward control, and we live under this control.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Whoever does the will of the Father is a relative of the Lord Jesus&mdash;12:50:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ, the heavenly King, always submitted to the Father&rsquo;s will, taking God&rsquo;s will as His portion and not resisting anything&mdash;11:28-30; 26:39.</li>
		<li>Whoever does the will of the Father is a brother who helps the Lord Jesus, a sister who sympathizes with Him, and a mother who tenderly loves Him.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The kingdom people need to pray for the Father&rsquo;s will to be done on earth as in the heavens; this is to bring the kingdom of the heavens to the earth&mdash;6:10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Father&rsquo;s eternal will is to build up the church upon Christ the Son as the rock&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22; 4:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s building is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart and the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9; 2:8, 10, 21-22; Exo. 25:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The desire of God&rsquo;s heart is to have a dwelling place on earth constituted with Christ and according to Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9; 2:21-22.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s building is the Triune God as life being wrought into us so that we may become His corporate expression&mdash;3:17a, 19b, 21.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s building is the mingling of God with man; the principle of God&rsquo;s building is that God builds Himself into us and builds us into Himself&mdash;John 14:20; 15:4a; Eph. 3:17a.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s building is the enlargement, the expansion, of the Triune God, enabling God to express Himself in a corporate way&mdash;Col. 2:19; John 3:30a.</li>
		<li>We need to be enlightened by and fully saturated with the thought that in this universe God is doing only one thing&mdash;building His eternal habitation&mdash; Matt. 16:18; Rev. 21:2-3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 16:18 is the greatest prophecy in the Bible: &ldquo;I will build My church&rdquo;:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His heavenly ministry the ascended Christ is directing and managing the building up of His church&mdash;Eph. 1:19-23; 4:8-16.</li>
		<li>The rock in Matthew 16:18 refers both to Christ and to the revelation concerning Christ; this means that the church is built both upon Christ and upon the revelation concerning Christ&mdash;Eph. 2:19-20.</li>
		<li>As the stone for God&rsquo;s building, Christ is the foundation stone, the topstone, and the cornerstone; in Him and through Him, we are becoming living stones to be built up as a spiritual house&mdash;Matt. 21:42, 44; Isa. 28:16; Zech. 3:9; 4:7; 1 Pet. 2:4-5.</li>
		<li>The Gospel of Matthew is concerned with the kingdom of the heavens, which is a matter of authority; thus, the church in this book represents the kingdom to reign&mdash;16:18-19; 18:18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the church there is the heavenly rule and government, and there is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</li>
			<li>Both aspects of the church&mdash;the universal and the local&mdash;indicate that the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having authority to bind and to loose&mdash;16:19; 18:18.</li>
			<li>The Lord Jesus declared that the gates of Hades will not prevail against His church; Satan&rsquo;s power of darkness cannot prevail against the genuine church built by Christ&mdash;16:18b.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s word about &ldquo;a city situated upon a mountain&rdquo; indicates that the kingdom people need the building&mdash;5:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The light is not an individual believer; the light is a corporate city built up as one entity to shine over the people surrounding it.</li>
		<li>The city is the light; if there is no city, there is no light&mdash;Rev. 21:23-24a.</li>
		<li>If we are divided, we are finished with the shining; in order to be a shining city, we must keep the oneness and remain one entity, a corporate Body&mdash;Eph. 4:1-6; 5:8-9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To be built up with fellow believers is the Lord&rsquo;s supreme and highest requirement of His faithful seekers according to the divine oneness of the Divine Trinity&mdash;John 17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is not for individuals but for a corporate people&mdash; Matt. 5:3-16.</li>
		<li>Being built up with fellow partakers of the divine life is the highest virtue of one who pursues after Christ according to God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Eph. 2:21-22; Phil. 3:7-12.</li>
		</ol></li>
