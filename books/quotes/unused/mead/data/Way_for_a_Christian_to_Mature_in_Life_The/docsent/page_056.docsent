   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHEREVER THERE IS FREEDOM, THERE BEING GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then we with unveiled face are able to meet the Lord face to face and behold His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord is the Spirit, the Spirit is freedom, and freedom is glory, which is God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How do we know that we are experiencing glory?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is the same as freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we feel released, comfortable, and easy, that is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we feel noble, honorable, and transcendent, that is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the saints are going to a movie, they have a feeling within them that they should not go.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, some of them struggle within, do not obey, and still go.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then when they arrive at the theater, they have no peace, so they look around to see if there are any other brothers or sisters there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then they quickly go into the theater.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When they go home after the movie, they feel that they are so low and cannot stand upright.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they come to the meeting, they surely will not lift up their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their spirits will not be able to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What kind of feeling is this?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is this glory?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In fact, this kind of feeling is the opposite of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose you want to go to the movies, but because you do not have peace within, you say to the Lord, O Lord, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I want to please You.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then after saying this, you do not go.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a result, you will be a transcendent Christian, and when you go to the meeting, you will be soaring inside.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not pride; it is a bright, shining, and transcendent feeling that comes from having the presence of the Lord and the beauty and joy of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such an experience cannot be described.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is clear, shining, and glorious, and it causes you to feel comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the experience of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Where the Spirit is, there is freedom, and where there is freedom, there is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even if he does not go to the movies, if a normal Christian loses his temper a little at home, when he sees the saints, he will feel cowardly and will be afraid of seeing their faces.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is because he feels low and lacking within.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is not released.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if he overcomes at home and allows the Lord to have the ground, when he sees a saint in the distance, he will immediately catch up with him and greet him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition, others will see that his face is shining just like Moses face shone with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a condition is the result of seeing the glory of the Lord face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BEING TRANSFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>INTO THE IMAGE OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>FROM GLORY TO GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second Corinthians 3:18 also includes the phrase reflectinglike a mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we have our face covered with a veil, there will be a barrier between the light and us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not until we have the veil taken away that our face and the light can be face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we can see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is like the reflecting of a mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because the Spirit is in us, we have freedom, our face is unveiled to the Lord, and we are face to face with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His glory shines upon our face, and we reflect His glory like a mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We cannot pretend to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only when we meet a brother who has God s shining and glory on his face, will we immediately feel God s presence and sense that God is being expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many times when we meet one of the saints, we groan within and are sad.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although this one is a believer, he seems to have fallen down to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is unable to get up and cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the other hand, sometimes when we meet one of the saints, we bow down and worship the Lord, realizing that this is a man who is ascendant and standing upright.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is a man who is standing on the ground and reaching to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is active and is able to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We sense that this man has glory the glory of God is on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Where does this glory come from?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It comes from having freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is freedom?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Freedom is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>And who is the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Spirit is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The four the Lord, the Spirit, freedom, and glory are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then our entire being is set free, and we reflect like a mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Eventually, we see the glory of the Lord, and from this glory to the ultimate glory, we are being transformed into the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This very image is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>People will be able to see the Lord, the image of the Lord, in us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Where does this image come from?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It comes from glory, and this glory comes from freedom, freedom comes from the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Where is this Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord is the Spirit, and He is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When our heart loves Him and opens to Him, He comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>And when He comes out, when He moves, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whenever the Lord moves and acts, He is the Spirit; and whenever the Spirit comes out and enters into our mind, emotion, and will, He is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then the Spirit of the Lord is in our entire being, and our entire being is set free.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This freedom is glory, which is the presence of God and the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This makes us feel noble, honorable, and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is glory, and this is the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If day by day we love the Lord and give Him the opportunities, day by day the Lord will spread out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then we will grow and be transformed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Ultimately we will be transformed into the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Originally we had only the Lord within us, but through transformation we will have the image of the Lord within us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This image is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>People will realize that we have a certain condition.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This condition is the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We can also call this a condition of having glory, freedom, release, the presence of the Lord, and the Lord s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>These five things are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When we have freedom, our face is unveiled to see the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then, from glory to glory, we are transformed into the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When the Lord lives out from within us, we grow and become mature.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Therefore, we need to open our heart to the Lord and let Him spread out from our spirit into our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Once He enters into these parts of us, we are free, we have glory, and we are honorable.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>At this time we have His image.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When our mind is like His mind, our desires are like His desires, and our decisions are like His decisions, we will have His image.</S>
