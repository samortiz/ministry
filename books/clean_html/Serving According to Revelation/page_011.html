<h2 class="head1">NOT DOING THINGS BY OURSELVES</h2>
<p>Most people prefer to do things by themselves; they do not like to work with others or to teach others how to do something. They feel that they can do things better and that others will do a less than perfect job. This is the natural disposition of most saints. They prefer to do things by themselves and do not want to be burdened with serving together with others. This natural disposition must be broken when we serve the Lord. When we serve the Lord, we must serve with others, bring others into the service, and teach others how to serve. Bringing others into the service is the way for us to serve in coordination with the saints.</p>
<p>For example, it is not good for a brother to visit the saints by himself. He should fellowship with one or two saints, share his feelings with them, pray with them, and visit the saints with them. When the saints with whom he is fellowshipping have a similar desire to serve by visiting the saints, he should bring more saints into this service through fellowship. After a period of time, a considerable number of brothers and sisters will be willing to serve in visitation through his leading. This principle applies not only to visitation but also to preaching the gospel and to other church services.</p>
<p>In our service to the Lord we must bear personal responsibility, but we must also bring others into serving in coordination with us. We can lead others, or we can be led by others, but we should never do anything by ourselves. When we lead others or are led by others, we can learn spiritual lessons and receive the necessary breaking. A sister may be loose and unrestrained when she serves by herself, doing whatever she wants without restrictions. However, she cannot be loose when she serves with other saints; she must be restricted. We must pay attention to this point in our service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO POINTS RELATED TO ELDERS</h2>
<p>I would like to consider two points related to elders.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Shying Away<br />
from Bothersome Saints</h2>
<p>The elders must have a disposition that is open to being bothered. Elders must not grow weary when saints bring their problems to them, nor should they be bothered by incessant questions. If the saints feel free to bother an elder, he is qualified to be an elder. If the saints in a local church do not visit an elder very often, he must not be a good elder. If he is good, the saints will bring their difficulties and problems to him for guidance, advice, and intercession. This is needed in every local church.</p>
<p>The elders must be concerned about the saints and should not fear being bothered by the saints. An elder should encourage the saints to fellowship about their difficulties and problems. Some elders, however, do not like to be bothered. They do not like to work or to bear heavy burdens. They ignore, avoid, or politely decline the saints who come to them. As a result, the saints stop coming to them, and the elders are at ease and relaxed, bearing no burden and having nothing to do. In a sense, they have lost their qualification to be an elder. An elder must love the saints from the heart and be concerned about their affairs. He must learn to open to the saints, to care for their problems, to bear their heavy burdens, to comfort them at any time, and to care for them as a father and an older brother. Such elders are needed in all the churches.</p>
<p>In every church there are saints who need help in spiritual matters, including pursuing the Lord, consecration, dealing with sin, praying, fellowshipping with the Lord, being led by the Lord, being broken, experiencing the cross, living in the spirit, and following the Spirit. No speaking from the podium can meet all the needs related to these spiritual matters. For this there is a need for daily leading.</p>
<p>There are also many saints who need help to solve practical problems. Some saints have family problems, some have work problems, some do not have a place to live, some are sick, and some are needy. The saints need the help of the elders. Many young brothers and sisters are in desperate need of care and guidance concerning marriage. The elders must consider the proper way to lead the young saints in this matter. The elders should find a way that pleases the Lord and does not take the way of the world. Hence, the elders in the churches must be open to the problems of the saints. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, the elders must give the saints suitable leading, guidance, and help. An elder should never be afraid of trouble or burden.</p>
<p>One of the qualifications of an elder is to be hospitable (1 Tim. 3:2). To be hospitable is to be willing to receive guests. The principle for receiving guests is to be loving and to be willing to be bothered. It is very troublesome to receive guests. Those who are not willing to be bothered cannot give hospitality. The Lord uses hospitality as a test to show who is qualified to be an elder, because elders must be willing to be bothered, to bear burdens, and to have a broad heart with empathizing compassions like elderly fathers.</p>
<p>An elder should not be a young man or a &ldquo;child.&rdquo; It is easy for a child to be happy one moment and angry the next. Two children may be unwilling to speak to each other one moment but be happily speaking to each other after a short period of time. This is the disposition of &ldquo;childish&rdquo; elders. They readily blame others but cannot bear burdens. They are not on good terms with Brother A today and have problems with Brother B tomorrow. They are like children. An elder should have a broad heart. He should be a father or elderly brother to the saints. He should be forbearing, and his mood and attitude should not depend on the condition of the saints. Instead, he should love and care for the saints wholeheartedly. Every elder should have these qualifications.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Keen Sense</h2>
<p>Elders also need to have a keen sense concerning the saints. They should be able to sense the heart and spiritual desire of the saints. For example, if the elders sense a desire in the saints to preach the gospel, they can lead the church to move in the preaching of the gospel. It is a regrettable situation if the elders do not have a spiritual sense related to the saints. If the elders are dull, it will not be easy for them to lead the church. Decisions related to the service of the church and the leading of the saints should come from the elders&rsquo; sense concerning the saints. If the sense of the elders is not keen, it will be difficult for the Lord to lead them. If the elders of a local church are not led, the church will suffer immeasurable loss.</p>
<p>A successful businessman knows how to generate business, to work, and to make profit. In the service of the church, the elders administrating the church must know how to generate spiritual &ldquo;business&rdquo; in order to expand the service of the church so that the saints can serve the Lord effectively. When a brother contacts the elders, they should sense his heart and consider how to guide him to serve the Lord. If this brother tells the elders that he has been wasting his time and would like to rise up to serve the Lord, the elders must have a sense concerning his heart and be led in making arrangements for him to serve. The elders must know how to help zealous saints serve the Lord, and they must know how to help cold and backslidden saints rise up to serve the Lord. The elders need to encourage those who do not love the Lord to love Him. The elders should also encourage those who do not preach the gospel to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Good elders know how to lead the saints, profit the church, and cause the church to grow. If the elders have a dull sense and do not know how to generate spiritual &ldquo;business,&rdquo; they will delay the Lord and damage the church. Hence, elders must learn to love the Lord more, fellowship with the Lord more, and deal with the Lord more so that they may be fresh and living, have a keen sense, and be capable of generating spiritual &ldquo;business.&rdquo;</p>
