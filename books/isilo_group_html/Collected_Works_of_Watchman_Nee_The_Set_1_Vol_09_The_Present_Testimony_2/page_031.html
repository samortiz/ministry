These include setting out from Gilgal, the journey to Bethel, the journey to Jericho, and the crossing of the Jordan River. Before Elijah was taken into heaven and Elisha received a double portion of the Holy Spirit, they passed through these four places. If we want to be like Elijah, who was taken into heaven, or like Elisha, who received the outer clothing of the Holy Spirit (that is, the Holy Spirit descending upon him like an outer garment), the crucial lesson is that we must travel on these four journeys. Whether we are raptured or receive the power of the Holy Spirit, we all must set out from Gilgal and journey until we cross the Jordan. Now we want to see the significance of the names of these four places.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. GILGAL-THE FLESH<br>(VERSE 1)</H2><P>The interpretation of every name must be based on its first mention in the Bible. If we read Joshua 5:9, we see that Gilgal means "to roll away." Verses 2 through 9 of this chapter tell us that the generation of Israelites who came out of Egypt were circumcised; however, those of the second generation, who were born in the wilderness, were not. At that point, they were about to enter Canaan and to receive the inheritance; they needed to have the old flesh and shame of Egypt rolled away so that they could begin a new living. Therefore, the meaning of circumcision is to put off the body of the flesh (Col. 2:11).</P><P>Is there anyone who knows what the flesh is? Is there anyone who knows what dealing with the flesh and judging the flesh are? Many people think that once they overcome sin, they are perfect. Little do they realize that the flesh still exists out from which comes sin! In the Bible the flesh is condemned by God and is very displeasing to God. The flesh is everything we possess from our birth. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" (John 3:6). All that we possess from our birth is of the flesh. In the flesh there is not only sin, uncleanness, and corruption, but also natural kindness, talent, zeal, wisdom, and ability. The most difficult lesson for a believer to learn in his life is recognizing his flesh. God must bring him through every kind of failure and exposure before he will know the flesh.</P><P>In the spiritual journey and work of a believer, the thing that hinders him the most is his flesh. He does not know that God's calling involves giving up his entire flesh. He considers that it is sufficient just to do away with sin. Little does he realize that his ability, zeal, wisdom in God's work, goodness, and capability in spiritual life are all displeasing to God. In God's eyes, what we consider to be good according to the flesh, including what we plan and ingeniously orchestrate, should all be rejected, put to death, and taken through judgment. God does not need man's flesh to help Him, either in his spiritual life or in his work.</P><P>Gilgal is the place where the flesh is judged and the place where God gives us the light to judge the flesh. God says the flesh must be put off; we must, therefore, agree with Him. When God says it must be cut off, we have to cut it off. We must start from Gilgal, and we must reject the flesh. It is not a matter of how much cutting should be done, but a matter of judging the flesh. The present error is that men pay attention to being zealous, doing good, and working, while forgetting to reject their flesh. But it is very important to judge the flesh the way God judges it. According to what I have learned before God, regeneration, sanctification, perfection, the overcoming of sin, and the acquisition of power are not the highest expressions of spiritual life. Rejecting the flesh is the proper spiritual path and goal of spiritual living. All those who have not set out from Gilgal have not started on the spiritual pathway. All those who have not learned to reject the flesh do not truly know the spiritual life. They can be zealous, work, and rejoice, but they do not truly know the spiritual life.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 09: The Present Testimony (2) &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
