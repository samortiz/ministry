[1]  Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ CONTENTS
[2]  Our fellowship in this book may be considered as a continuation of our fellowship from the winter training of 1987, which is contained in the book entitled The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ.
[3]  In this book we want to see more concerning this scriptural way.
[4]  If we handle these four elements in a proper and living way, there will be a rich display and expression of Christ in all of our meetings.
[5]  If we are going to be the speaking ones in our meetings, we must let the word of Christ dwell in us richly Col 3:16 .
[6]  The speaking in our meetings should be with the Spirit Acts 6:10 .
[7]  To speak with the Spirit is to exercise our spirit.
[8]  We do not need to wait for the Spirit to descend upon us because the Spirit is in our spirit, in our mouth, and in our heart.
[9]  When we speak the word of the Lord by our spirit we surely will have faith.
[10]  FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST
[11]  Now we are endeavoring, and we are desperate because we are in the Lord s recovery.
[12]  Thank the Lord that some of the saints among us have been laboring on the Word year after year; we have a history of studying the Word for over sixty years and we have reaped a lot of riches.
[13]  Whether or not this will work depends upon how much we will endeavor, how much we will labor, how much we will really offer ourselves to the Lord s new way.
[14]  In chapter one we have seen that the word spoken in our meetings includes poems such as psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.
[15]  First Corinthians 14:26 and Acts 5:42 tell us that teachings should also be spoken in our meetings.
[16]  These teachings, of course, must be according to the unique teaching of the apostles, and they are concerning the Triune God, concerning Christ, concerning the Spirit, concerning the church, concerning life, concerning the Christian life, and concerning other things related to the Christian life.
[17]  In the Lord s new way, each one of us has to learn to speak more than a few sentences.
[18]  In one meeting we may have a burden and be led by the Spirit to speak a message for about three minutes concerning one of the major points in the Bible.
[19]  CHAPTER THREE THE SPEAKING IN OUR MEETINGS 3 Scripture Reading: John 21:15, 17; Rev 3:1-2; 2:7, 17; 3:20-21; 1 John 1:6; 2 Cor 13:14; 1 Thes 5:17; Col 4:2; 1 Tim 2:8; Psa 119:147-148; Gal 5:16; Rom 8:4; Phil 1:19-21; Gal 2:20
[20]  In this chapter, we want to fellowship concerning a very subjective matter, that is, the speaking ones in our meetings.
[21]  The Christians who are in the denominations have hardly any idea about the matter of speaking in their services because they are used to coming to these services not to speak.
[22]  Since we came into the church life and have been meeting with the saints in the church life, we have been attending the church meetings every week.
[23]  Although we may have been Christians for many years, we do not have the thought that we need to rise up to be the speaking ones in the meetings.
[24]  For the God-ordained way, the biblical way, the new way, we all need, first of all, to love the Lord.
[25]  If we are going to feed the Lord s sheep, we have to speak.
[26]  We should tell the Lord, Lord, I love You, so I like to speak You forth to others.
[27]  Then we need to live a victorious life to overcome sin, to overcome the world, to overcome ourselves, to overcome our flesh, and even to overcome our quarreling with our spouse.
[28]  If we are going to speak for the Lord, we have to recover our fellowship with Him by confessing our sin and by making an apology to our spouse.
[29]  We also must learn to walk by and according to our spirit mingled with the Spirit Gal 5:16; Rom 8:4 .
[30]  Praise the Lord that we have a spirit and that our spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit!
[31]  Second, we have the Holy Spirit, who is the bountiful Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, living in us, in our spirit, which has been regenerated and strengthened.
[32]  CHAPTER FOUR THE SPEAKING IN OUR MEETINGS 4 Scripture Reading: Acts 5:42; 8:4; 2 Tim 4:2; 1 John 1:9; Acts 13:52; Eph 5:18; Acts 4:31, 8; 13:9; Phil 3:8-10, 12-14; Col 3:16; John 15:7; 1 John 2:14; Eph 5:19; 1 Cor 14:26, 4-5, 12, 31
[33]  In order to enrich and enliven our meeting, we must learn how to speak the word of the Lord in the Scriptures.
[34]  We must learn to speak and not just read the word.
[35]  We must also learn to have a corporate speaking of the word in our meetings.
[36]  When we have the speaking that utters and releases the holy word, the riches of God s word will be prevailing to touch all the attendants.
[37]  We also must be ones who deal with our sins thoroughly 1 John 1:9 .
[38]  We must have such a clearance within us if we are going to speak in the meetings or even if we are going to speak the gospel to anyone.
[39]  Regardless of whom we speak to, as long as we are speaking the word of God, Christ, or the gospel, we need a cleared conscience.
[40]  Furthermore, we need to be filled with the Spirit inwardly Acts 13:52; Eph 5:18 .
[41]  The Spirit in its essential aspect, the Spirit of essence, the Spirit of life, is for our being, our life, our living, our existence.
[42]  We all need to be filled with the Spirit in His two aspects we need to be filled inwardly so that we are full of life and filled outwardly so that we are full of power and authority.
[43]  Also, if we do not have a proper dealing with the Lord, we will not be fully released to have the strong faith that we are clothed with the Spirit as our authority.
[44]  When we speak anything concerning Christ, we have to speak in a way in which we are exercising our spirit and even our whole being to believe the Word of God.
[45]  In order to be the speaking ones in our meetings, we must also accumulate the experiences of Christ.
[46]  From Philippians 3:8-10 and 12-14, we can see that Paul was accumulating the experiences of Christ day after day.
[47]  Many times when we come to the meetings, we do not have much experience of Christ as a base, or a foundation, for our speaking.
[48]  If we would just practice to pray-read two to four verses from the Word every morning, and we do this week after week and month after month, we will gain a rich storage of the living word.
[49]  If you want to start with Philippians, you can begin with verses 1 and 2 of the first chapter: Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[50]  When we come to any meeting or meet with anyone, it will be easy for us to speak, and we will have the material to release because we have the experiences of Christ and the riches of the holy word accumulated and stored within us.
[51]  The speaking ones in our meetings must know some of the hymns on Christ, the Spirit, the church, life, etc. in our hymnal 1 Cor 14:26; Eph 5:19; Col 3:16 .
[52]  If we want to know the hymnal, we must spend some time to get into the table of contents of our hymnal.
[53]  CHAPTER FIVE THE SPEAKING IN OUR MEETINGS 5 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25; 1 Cor 14:40 BREAKING ALL FORMALITIES
[54]  In this chapter, we want to see something particular concerning the nature of our meetings.
[55]  As a rule, each gospel team that goes out should be composed of three persons of different ages, a young one, an old one, and one in the middle.
[56]  After baptizing a new one, immediately have the first home meeting with him for one hour, teaching him the Lord as the life-giving Spirit indwelling his regenerated spirit and leading him to pray by calling on the name of the Lord.
[57]  CHAPTER SEVEN KNOWING THE HYMNS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:26; Eph 5:18-19; Col 3:16
[58]  If we desire to be the speaking ones in the meetings, we have to know the hymns.
[59]  In order for us to enrich, strengthen, enliven, refresh, and uplift our meetings, we need to use the hymns.
[60]  We have seen that according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25, we need both speaking and singing in our meetings.
[61]  The speaking is not only the speaking of the word of God or the speaking forth of Christ but also the speaking of the hymns.
[62]  Many times we may not be able to find a verse or some verses in the Bible to meet the real need in the meeting, but we can easily find a hymn to meet the need.
[63]  The word blessing is used here not to refer to the good things the Triune God has given us but to the praise, the blessing, we offer to Him.
[64]  If we learn to sense the hymns, we can know their standard.
[65]  If we sing or read a hymn, we will have a deep sensation.
[66]  When we select a hymn for a meeting, we must do it according to our sensation based on the thought of the hymn.
[67]  In this chapter and in the next two chapters, we want to see some crucial points concerning the practice of meeting.
[68]  There are a few points we need to take care of when we speak in our meetings.
[69]  Furthermore, when we speak, we should do our best not to overlap others speaking.
[70]  While the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He told the unbelieving Jews that He did not receive glory from men John 5:41 and that they received glory from one another but they did not seek God s glory v. 44 . To seek man s glory is to seek some kind of rank or position.
[71]  We need to learn how to practice our meeting in a practical way.
[72]  We need to prepare ourselves for the meetings by praying, dealing with sins, being filled with the Spirit, and abiding in the fellowship with the Lord.
[73]  If we have the time, we can pray for fifteen or twenty minutes, but we should not pray too long.
[74]  The proper starting of our meeting should not be in the meeting hall but in our homes.
[75]  We should start the meeting by calling on the Lord s name, praying, singing, praising, and speaking.
[76]  While we are on the way to the meeting place and when we arrive, we can continue to enjoy the Lord in this way.
[77]  We all need to bring our topmost portion of the riches of Christ that we have enjoyed to the church meeting and present them for God s satisfaction and the saints nourishment.
[78]  Question: Could you give a little more explanation regarding not needing a prearranged program for our meetings?
[79]  Every special gathering has a special purpose and for that gathering we need a definite subject, a definite program, and even some prearrangement as to who will bear the burden for this meeting.
[80]  In particular, we want to cover some crucial points concerning our need to pay full attention to the way of speaking.
[81]  If we are going to speak properly, we must get ourselves prepared to speak in the meeting.
[82]  Unless we are burdened to speak or assigned to speak, we may not have any thought to speak in the meeting.
[83]  Many times when we speak, we disregard our spirit.
[84]  During the course of our speaking, we may only exercise our spirit when we come to a point which we prefer.
[85]  When we open our mouths to speak, we must exercise our spirits from the first word.
[86]  We must speak all the way not only in our spirit but also by exercising our spirit.
[87]  If we have seen that the new way to meet is better than the old way, we must endeavor to learn and practice this way and help others to do the same.
[88]  Question: What is the difference between overlapping someone s speaking and emphasizing a certain point?
[89]  Regardless of how much you would emphasize any point, you should not speak it by overlapping others speaking.
[90]  Question: If something is spoken that is incorrect according to the truth, should we let it go or should we correct the speaker in the meeting?
[91]  In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship regarding our need to pay full attention to the way of speaking.
[92]  Whenever we speak, either in or outside of the meetings, we should take Christ as the center and element.
[93]  If we give a testimony, give a short message, or sing a hymn, we must take Christ as the center.
[94]  This is because we are short of the knowledge and experience of Christ, and even though we may have some experience of Christ, we are still short of the utterance of Christ.
[95]  Even if we have the knowledge and experience of Christ and we have the proper vocabulary, we still need to learn to mingle our words, our speaking, with Christ.
[96]  If we do not have the assurance that we have Christ as the center and element of our speaking, it is better not to speak.
[97]  We should not forget that we have been gathered by the Lord out of every kind of occupation into His name, and we are now meeting in His name with Him.
[98]  As those who have a heart for the Lord, we need to learn to look to the Lord for His instant, refreshing enlightenment that we may have a new vision to speak with new utterances.
[99]  We also need to trust in the Lord s speaking within our speaking.
[100]  The real power and impact of my speaking is the Lord s speaking in my speaking.
[101]  But the experienced saints can sense that there is a treasure within my speaking, and that treasure is the Lord s speaking.
[102]  The Lord Jesus also said, The word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father s who sent Me v. 24 . The Lord Jesus had the attitude that His speaking would have been vain and empty if the Father did not speak in His speaking or if He spoke without the Father s working.
[103]  We may not be required to speak for ten or twenty minutes in the meetings, but even if we only speak for two or three minutes, we have to look to the Lord for His speaking within our speaking.
[104]  We need to endeavor to speak everything in the meetings with a verse or a portion of the Scripture as its base.
[105]  Whenever we meet, we have the assurance of the Lord s promise that He is with us Matt 18:20 .
[106]  In our speaking, especially in public meetings, when we interpret any part of the holy Word, either a single word, a phrase, a clause, a sentence, a paragraph, a chapter, or a book, we must not take the liberal way as some of the liberal translations.
[107]  When we go to the home meetings, we should be only in the type of what we are, that is, a brother or a sister.
[108]  HELPING THE NEW ONES TO READ THE BIBLE DAILY
[109]  AND USE IT FOR THEIR SHARINGS IN THE MEETING
[110]  We needed to be brought back to God, so the Lord Jesus shed His blood on the cross to take away our sin John 1:29 , to deliver us from the penalty of God s righteousness John 3:18; 5:24 , and to repossess us, accomplishing an eternal redemption for us Heb 9:12 .
[111]  For many years we have been in an old way of meeting in which one person speaks and the rest listen, so we must use a cane to help us have a new start.
[112]  Of course, our work is not a work of charity, but a work to bring God s salvation to the sinners, to impart the pneumatic Christ into the believing ones, to minister the divine life to them that they may grow in Christ, and to build up the local church for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[113]  CARING FOR THE NEW ONES IN THE SCRIPTURAL WAY
[114]  We should not think that it is hard to help the home meetings.
[115]  We need to practice taking care of the new ones in the home meetings and small group meetings until we become experts.
[116]  The fellowship in this chapter may be considered as advice, not as a charge or a law.
[117]  We need to exercise much wisdom regarding the way we live our Christian life in our locality after we have seen the light concerning the new way.
[118]  But in the new way we are going to the fish, and we have the assurance in the Lord that we can gain some.
[119]  If the church in your locality does not practice the new way, you should do your best to attend the regular meetings of the church, at least on the Lord s Day and if possible the prayer meeting.
[120]  Do not make a division or draw a line between who is positive for the new way and who is not.
[121]  Even in our talk we may say that a certain brother is not for the new way.
[122]  If your local church does not practice the new way and you grasp the chance in a meeting to promote it and preach or teach about it, this is not proper and indicates that you are not submitting yourself to the present practice of your local church.
[123]  The church in your locality may not practice the new way, yet the spirit, attitude, and atmosphere of the church allows you to fellowship about the new way or give a testimony of your practice of the new way.
[124]  We should never debate, argue, or fight with anyone concerning the new way, but we should carry the new way out in a living and building up way according to the Lord s instant leading and arrangement.
[125]  IN KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST
[126]  Related to the preaching of the gospel in the new way, I would not say that visiting people in their homes is the unique way to preach the gospel, but I have to say that it is the best way, the most prevailing way, the most effective way to bring people to Christ.
