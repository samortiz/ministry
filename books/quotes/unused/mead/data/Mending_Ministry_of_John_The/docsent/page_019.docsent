   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE ISSUE OF LIFE THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: John 2:16-22; 3:26-30; 10:16; 11:52; 12:24; 14:2, 3; 15:5, 12; 17:11, 21-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gospel of John is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This life is simply the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ came that we might have this life and might have it abundantly John 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through His death and resurrection He released this life and has imparted it into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We now have the Triune God within us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Life always has an issue.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Living things bring forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Surely the divine life will have a divine result.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Gospel of John the Triune God as the divine life brings forth the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Though this actual term is not used in John, the implication is strongly apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The verses above are the references in John which allude to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE HOUSE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Christ cleansed the temple, He said, "Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise" John 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Jews asked for a sign of His authority, He told them if they destroyed this temple, in three days He would raise it up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Contrary to their understanding, He was referring to the temple of His body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While He was on earth, His physical body was the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Old Testament type was firstly the tabernacle and then the temple, two stages of one thing, both typifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 1:14 says, "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His human body was a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Like the tabernacle of old, it was God's dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then in John 2 the Lord likens His physical body to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He predicts that the Jews will kill Him and destroy His body, yet in three days it would be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a clear indication that He considered His body the temple or house of God, the place where God dwelt on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In resurrection Christ raised up not only His physical body, but also His mystical Body, which includes us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Peter 1:3 says that we were begotten again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His mystical Body was begotten with Him in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The body of Christ, then, both physically and mystically, is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This mystical Body of Christ, as we know, is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is the implication in John 2, then, that out of Christ's resurrection the church will be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His physical body was a small type of His mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today Christ has a larger Body, the church, which is God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This joy of mine therefore is made full" John 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The bride here, of course, is the church, and Christ is the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You recall the occasion when John the Baptist spoke these words.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>More and more of his followers were leaving him to go to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John's disciples were unhappy about this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When they complained to him, John reminded them that he was not the Christ, but only one testifying for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The bride belongs to the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since John was only the friend of the bridegroom, surely the bride should not be with him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since John 3 is the chapter on regeneration, we know that the bride is the sum total of those who have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Out of regeneration the children of God are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Taken together, they form the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Revelation John was still writing of the bride and the sons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He saw the New Jerusalem come down out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He heard the promise that the overcomer will inherit these things, "and I will be God to him, and he shall be a son to Me" 21:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The sons of God are the components of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a statement is beyond our mental understanding, but this is what the Bible reveals.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may describe regeneration as the divine life in action.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The result of this action is the sons of God that constitute the bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That this bride is the church is fully revealed in Ephesians 5:23-32.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In John's mending ministry, however, the church, alluded to in John 3 as the bride, will ultimately consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
