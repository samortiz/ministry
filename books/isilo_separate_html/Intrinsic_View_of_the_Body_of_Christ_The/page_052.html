Parties in the church are useful for manifesting the approved ones, who are not divisive. We need to be ones who are approved by God. If we are approved by God, we will not be divisive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having the Same Care<br>for All the Members<br>to Avoid Division in the Body</H2><P>We should have the same care for all the members to avoid division in the Body (1 Cor. 12:25). Philippians 2:2 says that we should have the same love toward all the saints. We may be loving one another with different levels of love. We may love one brother on the highest level and another one on the lowest level. In other words, we love certain brothers more than other brothers. This causes division.</P><P>In the church life, we may love the excellent, marvelous members, and look down on other members. However, the same care should be given to all the different members. A difference in care causes division. First Corinthians 12 says that those members of the Body which we consider to be less honorable, these we should clothe with more abundant honor. If a member is not so comely, we should bestow more honor to him to make him more comely (vv. 23-24). This is to balance the love and to balance the honor in the Body in order to avoid division. We should love everyone on the same level, trying to avoid division in every way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>No Base, No Reason, No Excuse, No Justification,<br>and No Vindication for Any Kind of Division</H2><P>There is no base, no reason, no excuse, no justification, and no vindication for any kind of division. Regardless of what the reason is for division, that is not a reason in the eyes of God. If we think that there is something wrong with the elders or the other saints, we should not gossip about them. We should always go to the Lord. If we go to the Lord, the Lord will impress us to pray for them. If there is something wrong, we should tell the Lord Jesus. He is the only One who can heal the situation. We also should check with ourselves whether or not we are better than they are. Are we better than the elders whom we are criticizing? If we get into the Lord's presence, we will realize that we are worse. The Lord will help us to realize that we need to be adjusted in many ways. This is the way to keep the oneness.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
