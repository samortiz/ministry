   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 The Center</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The focus, the central point, of Genesis 3:15 is that the seed of woman, the Lord Jesus, would come to destroy Satan on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the strongest proclamation in the preaching of the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once again I say that Adam and Eve were trembling under the imminent sentence of death, but God, instead of condemning them, surprised them by preaching the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Adam and Eve had fear toward God and hate toward the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, God declared in His glad tidings that One entitled "the seed of woman" would come to destroy the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That was the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The promise regarding the seed of the woman and the coming destruction of the serpent was the glad tidings proclaimed to the first generation of sinners.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From the time that this promise was first given Satan has been the enemy of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He will continue to be their enemy until he is cast into the abyss Rev 20:1-3 and ultimately hurled into the lake of fire Rev 20:7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Until Satan is cast into the lake of fire he remains the enemy of the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>b In All the Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, this promise is fulfilled in all the overcomers until the time of rapture.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>c In the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This promise has been completely fulfilled in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Firstly, it was fulfilled at the time of His birth Matt 2:13-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Lord Jesus was born, the serpent stirred up a great deal of enmity, causing many young lives to be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Secondly, the promise was fulfilled throughout the Lord's earthly life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we read the four Gospels, we will see that Satan was continually troubling the Lord Jesus, pursuing Him and opposing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, Satan bruised the Lord's heel on the cross, as was prophesied in Psalm 22:16.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The promise in Genesis 3:15 reveals that Satan is the enemy of the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, the Lord Jesus came as the seed of woman to destroy the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today we are enjoying the fulfillment of this promise.</S>
