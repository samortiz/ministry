   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Our Body to Be Raised Up by God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>through His Power</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 14 Paul says, And God has both raised up the Lord and will raise up us through His power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God raised up the Lord bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our body is destined to participate in the Lord s glorious body in resurrection Phil 3:21 and to be raised incorruptible 1 Cor 15:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This will be the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even now the Spirit of the resurrected Christ, who dwells in us, gives life to our mortal body Rom 8:11 , making it a member of Christ 1 Cor 6:15 and a temple of God indwelt by His Holy Spirit v. 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am thankful not only that the Lord is for our body, but also that God will raise up our body, even as He raised up the body of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all have some physical defects, and none of us is absolutely healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We become tired and sometimes we become ill.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These weaknesses help us appreciate the Lord s promises concerning our body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verses 13 and 14 we have a dual promise: first, that the Lord is for the body; second, that God will raise up the body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know from Romans 8:11 that even today our mortal body can receive the supply of resurrection life and be sustained by it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes He heals us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first aspect of the dual promise concerning our body is that the Lord is for it and sustains it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From experience I have learned that the Lord is for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1943 I became seriously ill with tuberculosis and I was charged to have a complete rest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For a long period of time I had to lie in bed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One day my firstborn child, who was thirteen years of age, came to visit me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As I looked at him, I came very close to weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I prayed, Lord, will You grant me another fifteen years?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lord, look at my child, my firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In fifteen years he will be twenty-eight.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you will give me another fifteen years, I shall be content and willing to die when these years are over.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I praise the Lord that more than thirty-eight years have passed since I prayed to the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My body fully recovered from that illness, and during all these years I have been able to work hard.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord truly is for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the first aspect of the dual promise is for the present, the second aspect is for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord is for our body today, but God will raise up our body in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This raising up of the body refers to its transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When our body is resurrected, it will be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Shall I then, taking the members of Christ, make them members of a prostitute?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here Paul says clearly that our bodies are members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not an illustration, a metaphor, or a parable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the contrary, it is a statement of fact.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our bodies are actually members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 15 Paul says that our bodies are members of Christ, and in verse 17 he says that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How can we reconcile these two matters?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Are we one with the Lord physically or spiritually?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we say that we are not one with Him physically, then how can our bodies be His members?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we claim that our oneness with the Lord is physical and not spiritual, we fall into serious error, even heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our oneness with the Lord is both spiritual and physical.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we may not realize much of this now, one day it will be fully manifested that we are actually one with the Lord in body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then according to 1 John 3:2, we shall be fully like Him not only in spirit, but also in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First John 3:2 is a verse which emphasizes our likeness to the Lord in body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Philippians 3:21 has the same emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This verse says that the body of our humiliation will become the same as the Lord s glorious body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These verses indicate that we are one with the Lord both physically and spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our body will one day be absolutely like the Lord s glorious body in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our physical body can be likened to a seed sown into the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to 1 Corinthians 15, resurrection is actually the growth of a seed which has been sown into the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When a seed is sown, it is simply a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But when the seed grows and blossoms, it takes on a very different appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today our body is a seed sown into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But one day this seed will grow up through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When it grows in this way, it will change in appearance, although it will still be our body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When a grain of wheat is sown into the soil, it is wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When this seed grows up, it is still wheat even though it is very different in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At present, our physical body does not have a good appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For this reason, we do not appreciate our body so much.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, because our body is a member of Christ, it is dear and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eventually, in resurrection, this body will become exactly the same as Christ s glorious resurrected body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In verse 18 Paul says, Flee fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every sin which a man may do is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Fornication is a sin against our own body, which is a member of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is a serious warning not to abuse our body.</S>
