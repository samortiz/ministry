   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TEMPTATION OF JOB</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: When the devil sinned, he was driven to the earth away from God's presence and became the enemy of man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why is it that the devil was able to go before God again to accuse Job?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why would God even grant the devil's request to test Job?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If Job's faith was not strong at that time and he had failed, who would be responsible for this?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Honan</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Answer: God has His timing, and before the time He has set for the devil is up, the devil can still come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By Revelation 12, he will not be able to do it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God permitted the devil to do things to His children in order to manifest the faith of His children for His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If Job had failed, the one responsible would have been Job himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The outward temptation only shows the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, the devil also is partly responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, 1 Corinthians 10:13 cannot be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>WOMEN PREACHING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Question: In the Old Testament age, men were for the most part ignorant of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was often the custom of esteeming the male and despising the female.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus broke down the boundary between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both are created by God, both are God's children, and therefore, there is no important difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 Corinthians 11:5 the apostle Paul says, "But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Also 1 Timothy 2:12 says, "But I do not permit a woman to teach."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May I ask, is it sinful for a woman to pray with no head covering?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is it sinful for a woman to preach?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why is it that in these days women pray without a head overing?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How come there are still so many women who preach!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Honan</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Answer: Because men rebelled against the teachings of the Bible, they drifted with the current of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Adam was created first and then Eve 1 Tim 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man is the head of the woman 1 Cor 11:3 , and the woman was created to help the man v. 9; Gen 2:18 . These are unchanging principles of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The present women's liberation movement tries to overthrow God's ordained order.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How sad it is!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Originally, women did have their own position; to oppress them or to take advantage of them is not permitted by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, for anyone to change the positions which God has ordained for male and female is abominable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not because I am a male that I speak this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I were a female, I would also insist on the same.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible is the only standard for our words and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not want to hear what worldly philosophy says.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We dare not say whether it is sinful for a woman to pray with no head covering and to preach in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But one thing we know: to do this is against the commandment of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some may ask, "If the Bible says this, will it not be standing in the way of the tide of the age?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our answer is this: "When have we ever seen the Bible going along with the tide of the age?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>PREACHING IN HADES</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Question: First Peter 3:19-22 says that the Lord Jesus went down to Hades and preached to the spirits in prison those who were drowned by the Deluge in the days of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is there such a thing that the Lord Jesus went down to Hades to preach?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First Peter 4:6 also recorded, "The gospel was announced also to those who are now dead."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the dead are still able to hear the gospel, then the living ones do not have to believe any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is this kind of teaching possible?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Otherwise, how are these verses to be explained?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Honan</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Answer: This question has been answered in Issue No. 1.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please read it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE TEMPTATION OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Question: Did the Holy Spirit purposely lead the Lord Jesus to the wilderness to be tempted by the devil?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the devil tempted Jesus in the wilderness on that day, was it a visible kind of temptation, or was it an invisible kind of temptation?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A visible kind of temptation would be one in which the devil tempted Jesus through man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the devil tempted Jesus through man, please read Luke 4:5 KJV , which says that he led Him up to a high mountain!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How can there be such a high mountain in the wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What was the name of this mountain?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 9 says, "And he led Him into Jerusalem and set Him on the wing of the temple."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Was there a Jerusalem in the wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Was there a temple?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If there were none, how did the devil take Jesus to these places?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>An invisible kind of temptation would be for the Lord Jesus to go into the wilderness after He was baptized in the river Jordan and be caught up in a trance while contemplating and meditating there, and for the devil to take advantage of this, leading Him to a high mountain and to Jerusalem, showing Him everything, and inducing Him to submit to him, thus annulling the work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Which one of these two understandings is right?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Please instruct me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Honan</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Answer: The first Adam failed because of temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Unless the last Adam goes through temptations also, He cannot prove His qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At the river Jordan God has already acknowledged Him to be His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now this has to be declared before Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Holy Spirit purposely led the Lord Jesus to the wilderness to be tempted.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The devil tempts us by entering into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, from John 14:30 we see that he could not enter into the Lord Jesus to tempt Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, he probably came with a form.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But even with a form, the devil is free to come and go in a supernatural way Job 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Hence, there is not a problem as you have imagined.</S>
