<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verses Fourteen through Fifteen</H2><P>Verses 14-15: "And His head and hair were white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire; and His feet were like shining brass, as having been fired in a furnace; and His voice was like the sound of many waters."</P><P>Not only does the Lord's clothing reveal the nature of judgment, He Himself reveals nothing less than the same. "His head and hair were white as white wool, as snow." In the vision Daniel saw, the Ancient of Days' "clothing was like white snow, / And the hair of His head was like pure wool" (Dan. 7:9). We know that this Ancient of Days is God. Here the description of the Lord Jesus by John matches the one by Daniel. This shows that the Lord Jesus is God.</P><P>"His head and hair were white." This reveals the Lord's full wisdom. Proverbs says, "The hoary head is a crown of glory" (16:31), and it also says, "The beauty of old men is the hoary head" (20:29 ASV 1901). Therefore, the meaning of white hair is experience, glory, and age. Paul says, "God is the head of Christ" (1 Cor. 11:3). Therefore, the meaning of the head here reveals the divinity of the Lord Jesus. Our Lord Jesus is the "Father of eternity" (Isa. 9:6, Heb.). "His head and hair were white as white wool, as snow." In Isaiah 1:18 we see that God promised to wash our sins so that they are as white as wool and snow. When we think of our sins having been cleansed to the extent that we are just like the head and hair of the Lord, are we not amazed at the Lord's grace?</P><P>However, there is not a crown on His head! The time for Him to become King has not yet come.</P><P>"His eyes were like a flame of fire." That is why He can examine man's inward parts. This reveals that in His judgment the Lord is never wrong. Fire causes the good ones to be clean and the evil ones to be destroyed. In the book of Malachi, Christ is "like a refiner's fire" (Mal. 3:2). When the Israelites are restored, the Lord will wash away their filth by "the judging Spirit and the burning Spirit" (Isa. 4:4). In the last day, when Christians stand before the judgment seat, the Lord will also use fire to test man's work, "for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one's work, of what sort it is" (1 Cor. 3:13). "So then do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts" (1 Cor. 4:5). "For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad" (2 Cor. 5:10). Although we can now sin in secret and do things that men do not see or hear, yet "there is nothing covered up which will not be revealed."</P><P>The Lord's eyes behold the children of men (Psa. 11:4). "There is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are to give our account" (Heb. 4:13). Not only so, even today "the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him" (2 Chron. 16:9). Truly His eyes are like a flame of fire! Our eyes are dark within. We can only see things when there is light without, but the eyes of the Lord are not so. His eyes are like fire, and there is nothing that can hide from His face. Therefore, saints, do not forget this. Whatever you have hidden from men today will all be manifested before men in that day!</P><P>"His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace." Brass is the hardest of all metals. In the Bible, bronze has the meaning of judgment. Therefore, the wash basin in the outer court and the serpent Moses lifted up in the wilderness were both made of bronze. Bronze that has been refined in the furnace produces a fearful whitish color. The Lord's feet are like this. Whatever sin is judged by His sharp eyes will also be crushed by His feet. He will judge whatever is sinful to His eyes. His feet are "like shining bronze." How pure is His conduct! His dreadful holiness walks in the midst of the churches. How numerous are the sins that He condemns! Soon we will see His feet crushing Satan and everything that is abominable under Him.</P><P>His voice is like "the sound of many waters!" No one can resist Him. Men cannot control the sound of many waters. At this time, His voice is not soft and low as when He used to draw sinners to come to Him. Rather, His voice is now full of majesty and judgment. Everyone has to listen to Him. As the Psalmist says, "The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea" (Psa. 93:3-4). Ezekiel says, "And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters" (Ezek. 43:2). According to the Bible the sound of many waters signifies the majesty of God and His strength. Now this majesty and strength comes from the incarnated Christ.</P><P>The Bible also speaks of the power of the voice of our Lord Jesus Christ. He Himself says, "The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live" (John 5:25). Regarding His anger, Jeremiah says, "Jehovah will roar from on high, / And He will lift up His voice from His holy habitation; / He will roar mightily against His habitation; / He will respond with a shout like those who tread grapes, / Against all the inhabitants of the earth" (Jer. 25:30). Truly, "the voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty" (Psa. 29:4).</P>
