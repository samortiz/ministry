        <h1 class="msg">LESSON TWENTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO LEAD THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 13:7; Matt. 19:26; 2 Cor. 5:7; 1 Cor. 9:19-23; 1 Thes. 2:11; 2 John 12; 3 John 14</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="4">
<li>We must have a positive faith in every young person&mdash;1 Cor. 13:7; Matt. 19:26; 2 Cor. 5:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Having a positive faith means that with the good ones you believe that they will get better, and with the ones who do not seem to be good, you believe that they will become good.</li>
	<li>We are all Adam&rsquo;s descendants, a fallen race; even the children of godly people are fallen; you cannot judge a young person&rsquo;s future based on his situation today:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We cannot say that to be fallen is right, but please remember that all those who truly know God&rsquo;s salvation were once fallen people.</li>
		<li>If a person has been preserved since his birth and has never lived in a fallen way, he cannot have a deep experience of God&rsquo;s salvation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Whether the condition of the young people is good or bad, usually it is not trustworthy; all those who have some experience in the young people&rsquo;s work will not trust in the young people&rsquo;s condition but fully believe that God will gain them one day:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Today you may consider a certain young man very bad, but one day he may become very good, contrary to your view.</li>
		<li>In the same way, today you may think that a certain young man is very good, but some day he may become very bad.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>This will deliver us so that we will not work only on the young people whom we consider good and put aside those whom we consider bad; do not believe either in their good condition or in their bad condition; believe only in God&rsquo;s work:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Actually, sometimes it is hard for those who are consistently good to have spiritual perception, and often their growth is slow.</li>
		<li>If you spend time on those seemingly bad ones to turn them around, their spiritual understanding will be opened immediately after they have made a turn.</li>
		<li>This shows that those of us who do the work among the young people should not trust in their present condition.</li>
		<li>No matter how bad one may be, we still believe God&rsquo;s work can turn him; because we have such a positive faith, we pay attention to every young person.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Those who have a desire to do the young people&rsquo;s work need to learn how to match and adapt to the young people&mdash;1 Cor. 9:19-23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Do not ask them to adapt to you; you need to adapt to them to such an extent that you are like glue:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We who do the young people&rsquo;s work should be like glue, so that it does not matter if a young person is soft or hard or if he is three-dimensional, flat, or a surface with bumps and dents; we still need to stick to him.</li>
		<li>We have to go along with the young people and accommodate ourselves to them; we must bring people in not by our zeal but by our gentleness&mdash;learn to be as yielding as paste.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>It seems very hard to do the young people&rsquo;s work because the young people are too busy to care about pursuing the Lord; if they are busy with entering a higher school, then we work on them by going along with them in their preparation for this matter:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we are doing a real work, then even if a young person flies to the sky, we will follow him there to adapt to him.</li>
		<li>The young people being too busy is not the problem; the real issue is their interest; if they are interested in something, no matter how busy they are, they will have time for it.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When you go to reach people, do not contact them according to your tradition, background, or disposition; look to the Lord that you will be able to enter into their condition and situation.</li>
	<li>Learn to accommodate their character, age, disposition, and way of doing things, and contact people according to their situation and condition and not according to your disposition or tradition.</li>
	<li>From the Bible we can realize that for others&rsquo; profit, we must learn to accommodate their character, their age, their disposition, and even their ways of doing certain things.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paying attention to personal contact; the power and effect of doing a personal work with the young people are many times greater than the meetings:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The emphasis of a genuine work with young people is individual contact&mdash;1 Thes. 2:11; 2 John 12; 3 John 14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Big meetings do not have much effect on young people; when you gather them together, usually all you can do is give them a message and at most a little work of revival.</li>
		<li>It seems the way of personal contact is fragmentary and wastes a lot of time; seemingly, this way is less effective than holding big meetings where you can speak to hundreds of people at once.</li>
		<li>If all you have is meetings, the young people&rsquo;s work will end up with something that is only on the surface, like loose sand without foundation; it will not be able to produce any solid ones.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We speak too much, preach too much, and teach too much with very little visiting; most people are gained by face-to-face contact, and most people are retained and built by such personal contact.</li>
	<li>In the matter of personal contact, skills are needed; if you practice this matter seriously, gradually you will gain experience and insight:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>You will know which one among so many young people should be contacted and gained first; after one has been gained, he will go to stir others up in the same way.</li>
		<li>Even if there are no big meetings, many can still get saved and many can be raised up to love the Lord, and no matter what you speak, they will receive it; then the meetings will be one hundred percent effective, and you will be able to gain solid young people.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When you have personal contact with young people, on the one hand, you need to have broad contact with them, treating every one of them equally; on the other hand, you need to have specific contact:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Among so many young brothers and sisters, you need to feel and see which ones, once they are gained, will have impact on others.</li>
		<li>Then you should spend your effort on them first and help them to love and pursue the Lord; once they are raised up, they will influence the other young brothers and sisters.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Brothers, I say again, the Lord has a great need for the young people. This generation needs many young people to rise up in a strong way to receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and be led by the Lord to become useful vessels in His hands&rdquo;&mdash;<em>How to Lead the Young People,</em> p. 37.</li>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
