NEEDING TO FUNCTION TO SUPPLY OTHERS</h2>
<p>If we open to the Lord faithfully, the Spirit of the Lord will lead us to be a member who supplies others. Even an elderly sister, who has been saved for many years and who also loves the Lord dearly, can function to supply others with grace. We do not need to wait for the elders to give us a title in order to function. We need to believe that the Lord&rsquo;s grace is with us, and we must rise up to faithfully and diligently to offer our portion.</p>
<p>We all love the Lord and are willing to pay the price because we have a heart; however, we need to take a further step to bear this burden faithfully. On the surface it is a burden, but actually, it is a blessing. In your eyes I am laboring; actually, I am quite joyful because I see so many being saved and so many young people being trained and receiving grace. This is a joy to me. If we all function in the small groups, our small groups will ignite the city of Taipei just like a spark of fire burns through a meadow.</p>
<p>Hence, we should not be timid or proud. Our spirit has to rise up. Once we rise up in spirit, we will not care for outward ways or practices that can cause us to deviate, to be opinionated, and to be divided. We do not care for these things at all. We desire to be fully in the spirit, to love the Lord, to love the church, to love people, and to love the brothers and sisters. As long as we receive a burden in spirit, the blessing will come. Then whomever we touch will be enlivened, whomever we meet will be blessed, and whomever is in our thoughts will be waiting for us when we visit. It is not a small matter when someone dreams of us coming to visit. This was the story of Paul&rsquo;s conversion in the New Testament. When Saul of Tarsus was saved, no one dared to believe that he could be saved because he had persecuted the Lord&rsquo;s church so severely. Then the Lord sent Ananias to seek him out, and while the Lord was conversing with Ananias, He told Ananias that Saul had seen a vision of Ananias&rsquo;s coming while he was praying (Acts 9:10-12). The dream of the hospital director was a similar work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We should all be faithful. We should not say that we have no responsibility because we are not an elder or a deacon. Every person should be in a small group. If we love the Lord and are faithful, we should begin to work in our small group. First, we should build up the small group by being burning and by burning others. After two months of mutual burning, the entire group will be in a revived condition, and even when the saints in the small group see each other in a big meeting, the meeting will be enlivened. Every member in a group must have a sense of responsibility; every person is responsible. However, we must bear in mind that there should not be any competition or rivalry within a group.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Love and Patience</h2>
<p>We all should learn to kindle a fire in the group and also to kindle a fire in order that every brother and sister can be burning. Every recovered brother and sister is tender and delicate; they must be treasured. They cannot be touched casually, or they will be damaged. However, it is not necessary to always let them have their way. In our interaction with them, we must exercise our spirit and have love toward all.</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:14 says, &ldquo;We exhort you, brothers, Admonish the disorderly, console the fainthearted, sustain the weak, be long-suffering toward all.&rdquo; The most touching part of this verse is being &ldquo;long-suffering toward all.&rdquo; When we are with the brothers, we often are quite lacking in patience. Even I need to learn this lesson because it is hard for me when I see the trainees being so sloppy. Sometimes, when I look at their shoes, it seems as if they have not been polished for two or three years. In 1953, when I set up the first formal training here, I trained the brothers to polish their shoes. I spoke a strong word to the trainees, telling them, &ldquo;If your shoes are not well polished, do not expect your work to be carried out in a good way.&rdquo; The brothers and sisters who were being trained at that time are now fifty to sixty years old. They remember the detailed aspects of our training. I often went into their rooms at irregular times and touched their desks or nightstands with my fingers to see if they were dusty; this was part of our training. We should not despise these things. If our shoes are not well polished, should we expect to be able to properly recover a brother?</p>
<h2 class="head2">Putting Emphasis on Personality and Character<br />
and Needing to Be Diligent and Faithful</h2>
<p>In 1965 I brought an American brother to the Philippines. He had been a traveling evangelist with some renown before turning to our way. I took him with me to the Philippines because the door to the gospel was quite open there. The saints offered him warm hospitality, putting him in the best room. However, even though he was quite good in preaching the gospel, the character in his living was rather disturbing to others. The brothers who gave him hospitality told me that he made a mess of the house where he stayed; this greatly detracted from the gospel he preached. His gospel preaching was like someone building a house twenty feet high but then tearing it down by ten feet. Although he was a competent speaker and very eloquent, he did not have much fruit in his work. Thus, having much knowledge and great ability does not necessarily mean success. Success depends not only on knowledge and ability but also on character and personality. We need to be diligent and faithful. If we are proper in personality, character, diligence, and faithfulness, we will have success even if we are slightly lacking in knowledge and ability.</p>
<p>We all must bear responsibility in the small group before the Lord and learn to be patient. When we take care of a brother, he may not be helped immediately or even want to receive our help. We should never let this be a source of hurt for us or a point of blame toward him. If we have a quick disposition, desiring quick results, we need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy so that we will be persistent in our prayers. Even if the brothers and sisters we are caring for do not meet our expectations, being anxious concerning them will be of no benefit. In fact, the more anxious we are, the further they will seem to be from our expectations. We need patience.</p>
<p>Patience in a small group is essential because it is not easy for someone to become instantaneously burning. When this is the case, we should not murmur or be disappointed. We have to be long-suffering and patient with endurance. Even if a person has not become burning after six months, we need to continue to labor. We should never say, &ldquo;Forget it! I will let him go; I do not care any longer.&rdquo; Of course, we also should not be stubborn, pressing him to be burning when it is obvious that he is not open to be burning. We need wisdom with regard to our time, neither abandoning him nor being anxious about him. If he is slow to begin to be burning, we should let him be slow for a period of time. In the meantime, we can fan others into flame. After fanning others for a period of time, he may become burning as soon as we focus on him again. We should bring these matters to our fellowship with the Lord so that we can gain a proper sense of His burden and timing.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 4: The Increase and Spread of the Church &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
