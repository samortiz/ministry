   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IS THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord said that He is the way, and He also said that He is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Truth is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Truth is not words concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Truth is not doctrines about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Truth is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christians often consider expositions and explanations of Christ to be the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, truth is not an exposition of a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Truth is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord said, "And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free" John 8:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brothers and sisters, let us consider how many truths have set us free.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's Word says that the truth shall set us free, that it shall liberate us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But many times, the truth is merely a doctrine to us; it is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our eyes have not been opened to see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What a pity that we have been preaching so many doctrines for ten years, yet we still have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may have heard many doctrines for ten years, yet we still have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Men can speak about the doctrine of co-crucifixion, but others do not see the power of crucifixion in them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They can speak about the resurrection life, but others do not see the resurrection power in them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If what we preach are merely doctrines, then we only have things that are dead, not something that is living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once a person wrote a letter to a brother and said, "A brother has offended me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I do not know if I should forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, I am writing to you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My heart is unbiased.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you say that I should forgive him, I will forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you say that I should not forgive him, I will not forgive him."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brothers and sisters, do you think that this sounds like a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose I have a loved one who has died, and I write a letter to others, saying, "My loved one has died.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Should I cry?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you say I should cry, I will cry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you say I should not cry, I will not cry."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you heard this, you would surely laugh, because this is ridiculous.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If one cries because others tell him to cry or does not cry because others tell him not to cry, his crying will be a performance, and his not crying will also be a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Both will be a performance, and both will be dead works without life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here is a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You either forgive him or you do not forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you say, "I will forgive him if I know I should forgive him, and I will not forgive him if I know I should not forgive him," this is dead work based on dead teaching; it is even a kind of false performance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brothers and sisters, if we do not have the Lord living within us, and if it is not the Lord who is our truth, a teaching that guides our action is nothing but dead works; it is not life, and it is not living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do you see the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The difference here is too great and too tremendous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Working requires that we exercise our memory, but life does not require us to exercise our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we speak something out of life, we do not speak it because we remembered to speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A power within us motivates us to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord is controlling us; a doctrine is not coaching or controlling us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The day will come when the Lord will open our eyes to see that spiritual reality is not apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not present some doctrines to others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, we lead others to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not need to remember a doctrine and then act according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, Christ is living in us, and Christ is becoming our truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once a brother offended another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The offended one could not contain himself, and he gave the other brother a severe scolding.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the scolding, his conscience bothered him, and he felt that he should go and apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet when he considered how the other brother had offended him, he could not help being angry again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nevertheless, he felt that he had to apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So he prepared a letter to the other brother.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first thing he said in his letter was, "It was wrong for me to scold you."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But he again recalled how the other brother was wrong to offend him, and he became angry again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After a while, he picked up the pen to start writing again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But while he was writing, he could not stop the hate and anger toward the other brother.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After he finished the letter, he was still angry when he sent it out.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Outwardly, it seemed as though the letter was a very proper Christian letter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But this was merely the result of teachings; it was not the result of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although he had written his letter and had apologized, he was still angry at heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When he saw the other brother, he might be able to greet him and might be able to shake hands with him, but inwardly he had not forgiven him, and his speaking would not be natural at all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brothers and sisters, do you see the difference here?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If what we do is a teaching and not the Lord, it is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should realize that spiritual things are living only when the Lord is there, and they are dead when the Lord is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the Lord shines within us, when He becomes the One working within us, and when we realize this inwardly, what we have will be living.</S>
