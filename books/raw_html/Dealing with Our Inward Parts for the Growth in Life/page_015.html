<h2 class=head2>Having a New Element Added to Our Spirit</h2><p>When we received the Lord, our spirit was not only made alive but also was made new. Another life, another element, was added into our spirit. This other life and element is the divine, uncreated, eternal life of God, which is Christ Himself. When the Holy Spirit comes into us, based upon the redeeming work of Christ, He not only makes our dead spirit alive but also brings Christ into our spirit as the new element, as another life added into our spirit. This is something more than what God accomplished in His creation. Now not only has our dead spirit been recovered and made alive, but also we have something new added to our spirit, another element, essence, and substance.<h2 class=head2>Having Received Christ Himself in Regeneration</h2><p>To be made alive is to be reborn, to be regenerated, as spoken of in John 3:6. This verse says, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” By our regeneration something other than what we had was added into us. This new element, essence, and substance is Christ Himself as the divine life added into us. Not only was the old part renewed, and not only was the old part made alive, but something new, divine, and eternal—Christ Himself—was added into us as the very essence of life.<p>What could be better than Christ Himself? Since we have received Christ, why do we still seem so poor? Today many Christians need to know this reality. Atomic power is something inward, not outward. Even a small piece of paper has this atomic power within it. At the time we received Christ, something more powerful than atomic power was added into our spirit. That was Christ Himself. If we truly believed this, we would declare, “Hallelujah, this is wonderful!” Whether or not we realize this adequately, we still have to thank Him that such a wonderful, all-inclusive, exhaustless, immeasurable Christ has been added into us. We do not have the adequate words to qualify what kind of Christ we have received and has been added into us. Only eternity can tell the story. However, even if we do not see this truth adequately, we still have received Him.<h2 class=head2>Being Renewed and Indwelt by the All-inclusive Spirit</h2><p>From the time of our regeneration, our spirit has been indwelt by the all-inclusive Holy Spirit. According to Ezekiel 36:26, at the time we were saved, God not only renewed our heart but also renewed our spirit. Then verse 27 tells us that He put His own Spirit into us. John 14:17 also tells us that this wonderful Spirit is in us. Romans 8:11 says that His Spirit dwells in us, and verse 16 proves that this Spirit dwells in our human spirit. Our spirit is the very residence of the Holy Spirit. From the time of our salvation, our spirit has become such a wonderful spirit—made alive, renewed with Christ as the divine life added to it, and having the all-inclusive Holy Spirit dwelling in it.<h2 class=head2>Being Joined to the Lord as One Spirit</h2><p>Moreover, 1 Corinthians 6:17 clearly tells us that from this time onward this wonderful spirit is joined to the Lord as one spirit. Our spirit and the Lord Himself as the Spirit—these two spirits—are joined together as one spirit. No human words can exhaust the meaning of this.
