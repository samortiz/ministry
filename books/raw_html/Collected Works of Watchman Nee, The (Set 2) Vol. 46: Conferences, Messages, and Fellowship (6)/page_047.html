<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">FIVE KINDS OF FORGIVENESS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:32; 1 John 1:9; John 20:23; James 5:15-16; Matt. 6:14-15; Gal. 6:7; Luke 6:37-38; 2 Sam. 12:9, 14</h1><p>According to Ephesians 4:32, we were forgiven by God in Christ. According to John 20:23, the disciples have the authority to forgive: "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven." According to 1 John 1:9, if we confess our sins, He will forgive us. According to Matthew 6:14-15, if we forgive others, God will forgive us, and if we do not forgive, we will not be forgiven. According to James 5:15, if we have sinned and we ask the elders to come and pray for us, we will be forgiven. By reading these five passages we note that they all speak of the matter of forgiveness. They also speak of five different kinds of forgiveness, not just one kind.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ETERNAL FORGIVENESS GRANTED<br />BY CHRIST JESUS</h2><p>The first kind of forgiveness is eternal forgiveness because God forgives us for Christ's sake. If we have this forgiveness, we are saved for eternity; we will never perish. If the Lord forgives our sins, we know that we are saved for eternity; therefore, this is eternal forgiveness.</p><h2 class="head1">INSTRUMENTAL OR PRONOUNCEMENTAL<br />FORGIVENESS</h2><p>In John 20:23 the Lord told His disciples that the sins they forgave were forgiven and vice versa. Rome has built a system of forgiveness on this verse, teaching that their priests have the authority to forgive or retain sins. We know that this is false. What did the Lord tell the disciples that they had authority to do? What is the meaning of this passage? We know that the Lord is the only One with authority to forgive. When He was on earth, He said to one man, "Your sins are forgiven" (Matt. 9:5). The Jews objected because they thought that God was the only One who had authority to forgive. John 20:23 does not speak of eternal forgiveness, but of forgiveness granted by the church. What does this mean? If you are a sinner who believes in the gospel and applies for baptism or the Lord's supper, the church has something to say. If the church believes you are truly the Lord's, they will receive you, but if not, they will reject you. This forgiveness is an instrumental forgiveness. God uses the church to pronounce whether sins have been forgiven or not. Moreover we must connect verse 22, which says, "Receive the Holy Spirit," with verse 23, which says, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained." This shows that if the church is in the power of the Holy Spirit and they say that a man is saved, he is saved. If they say that he is not saved, he is not saved. This does not mean that the church can cause a man to be saved or unsaved, but that the church is the instrument of God to pronounce whether or not a man is saved.</p><p>So far we have seen two kinds of forgiveness: eternal forgiveness and instrumental forgiveness. But we need more than this.</p><h2 class="head1">RESTORATIVE FORGIVENESS</h2><p>After we have become a Christian, we often fall. We know that we should not and yet we do. The sins of the past have been forgiven and yet we sin again. What should we do? We must go to God and apply for new forgiveness. Our position as to eternal forgiveness is settled. No question can ever be raised regarding eternal forgiveness. Once God has forgiven our sins, He will not revoke His forgiveness. But if we sin after we have been saved, we lose our communion with God. We are still His sons, but we cannot look into His face. If your son sinned against you, he would not be disinherited because of his sin, but he would lose his fellowship with you. There would be a barrier. As a Christian we cannot lose our life, but we can lose fellowship with God. It is impossible to lose eternal life, but it is possible to lose our fellowship. If we sin as Christians, we must get new forgiveness; otherwise, we cannot have communion with God. First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins." (Remember that 1 John was written to Chris- tians; therefore, he is dealing with the sins of the saved, not the unsaved). The Word says that if we confess our sins, we will be forgiven. If a saint sins, he must go to the Father and confess, "I have sinned, please forgive me." "We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous" (2:1). He is at the right hand of the Father for us. He presented His whole work before God. In His merit we can look up to God, confessing our sins and accepting His forgiveness. This forgiveness differs from eternal forgiveness; it also differs from instrumental forgiveness. When the church says that we are saved, it is an instrumental pronunciation of salvation, but this forgiveness restores our fellowship. Therefore, we can call it a restorative forgiveness. Forgiveness is for sins in regard to eternal salvation. Forgiveness is for our position among the people of God. Forgiveness also restores us to fellowship with God. The first is a matter of salvation, the second is a matter of the church, and the third is a matter of life in the family. We now have forgiveness in regard to eternal life, the church, and the family of God&mdash;three different kinds of forgiveness.</p>
