[1]  God Mingling Himself with Man by Being Man s Life
[2]  IN THE UNIVERSE A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION
[3]  Ephesians 1:17 says, That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.
[4]  In this verse the apostle speaks of a spirit of wisdom and revelation in order that we may know God.
[5]  In other words, if we desire to know God, we must have a spirit of wisdom and revelation.
[6]  First John 1 speaks of the fellowship of life.
[7]  We all know that the central goal of the Bible is life, and the central goal of the universe is also life.
[8]  As far as created life is concerned, human life is the highest life; however, apart from created life, there is still an uncreated life, as indicated by the tree of life, the eternal life of God.
[9]  CHAPTER TWO GOD AS LIFE COMING TO BE MAN S LIFE
[10]  First John 5:11 says, This life is in His God s Son ; therefore, he who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life v. 12 . Revelation 22:2 says that the tree of life is in the New Jerusalem.
[11]  Now we need to see how God came to be man s life and to be mingled with man.
[12]  Therefore, for God to take life as the center of the universe means that He takes Himself as the center of the universe.
[13]  Hence, Psalm 36 says that life is in God and that the source of life is with God.
[14]  According to Romans 8:2, after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit is called the Spirit of life, proving that life is in the Spirit and that the Spirit is life; hence, the Spirit is called the Spirit of life.
[15]  God comes to be our life, not to be our power, because He desires to mingle Himself with us.
[16]  HE WHO EATS THE LORD LIVING BECAUSE OF HIM
[17]  In John 6:53-56, the Lord said, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves.
[18]  He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.
[19]  God s central goal in the universe and in the Bible is life.
[20]  The word life indicates that God desires to be man s life.
[21]  The Triune God first flowed out with Himself as the content through Christ s incarnation, and then He flowed out through Christ s death and resurrection as the Spirit in order for us to receive Him as our life.
[22]  Hence, when we touch God in the pneumatic Christ, we touch life, because life is God as the pneumatic Christ.
[23]  Therefore, the Spirit is the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , through whom man can receive life; moreover, the mind set on the Spirit is life v. 6 . Because the Spirit is the Spirit of life, when a person touches the Spirit with his spirit, he touches life; when he contacts the Spirit, he contacts life; and when he obeys the Spirit, he experiences life.
[24]  In order to see how God begot us, we need to understand John 2, which tells a wonderful story about changing water into wine, about changing dead water into living wine.
[25]  In this story, dead and exhaustible water became endless and inexhaustible wine; this is the changing of death into life.
[26]  To be regenerated is to be born again following our original human birth; it is to have the life of God in addition to our human life.
[27]  If the Spirit did not enter into us, life could not come into us; if the Spirit did not enter into us, the Son could not come into us; and if the Spirit did not enter into us, the Father could not come into us.
[28]  I hope that we would all have a deep impression that life is altogether a matter of spirit, a matter of the Spirit of God with our human spirit, a matter of the Spirit of God entering into our human spirit, and a matter of the union and mingling of the Spirit of God with our human spirit.
[29]  How does the Spirit of God enter into our human spirit to regenerate us?
[30]  John 6:63 says, The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.
[31]  The way the Spirit of God comes into our spirit and begets us is through the Lord s words.
[32]  The Spirit may be likened to life in the human body, and the words of God to the human body itself.
[33]  In the New Testament, being made alive, receiving life, and being regenerated are seemingly three different things, but they are actually the same thing, because the Spirit who enters into us to enliven us, to make us alive, through the words of God is the Spirit of resurrection, the Spirit of life.
[34]  CHAPTER SIX THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT THE WORD OF GOD AS THE SEED OF LIFE REGENERATING MAN
[35]  The Bible reveals that the word of the Lord, as the seed of life, contains the life of God 1 Pet 1:23 .
[36]  A seed is something tangible, yet it contains life, which is intangible.
[37]  Then it turns from life to the Spirit in chapter 3, and in chapter 20, on the evening of the Lord s resurrection, He came into the midst of the disciples and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit v. 22 . This shows that where the Spirit is, there is life; without the Spirit, there is no life.
[38]  As the Lamb of God v. 29 , He passed through a process to be food to man 6:51 that man might eat Him and receive Him.
[39]  First, He enters into us to abide with us forever v. 16 . Second, He causes us to live as Christ lives; that is, He causes Christ to live in us v. 17 . Third, He reminds us of the things which the Lord said; that is, He speaks and explains Christ to us inwardly v. 26 . This means that the Christ in the four Gospels is being spoken of and explained to us by Himself as the Spirit in us.
[40]  To guide us into all the reality is to guide us into all the reality of God that is in Christ v. 13 . Sixth, the Spirit glorifies Christ in us so that Christ may have the preeminence in us, just as He has the preeminence in the universe; this is seen in chapter 17.
[41]  CONVICTING MAN CONCERNING SIN, CONCERNING RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND CONCERNING JUDGMENT
[42]  First, the Spirit in us is our life; second, Christ lives in us; third, the Spirit in us explains and speaks Christ to us; fourth, the Spirit in us testifies concerning Christ; fifth, the Spirit guides us into all the reality of God that is in Christ; and sixth, the Spirit glorifies Christ in us so that Christ may have the preeminence in us and possess all that is ours.
[43]  Life is Christ living in us, and the Spirit is explaining and speaking Christ in us, testifying to us concerning Christ, guiding us into the reality of God in Christ so that He may have the ground and everything in us, and enthroning Christ in us so that He may be glorified.
[44]  THE SPIRIT OF RESURRECTION THE WORD IN JOHN 1 AND WORDS IN JOHN 6
[45]  This Spirit includes God, Christ, incarnation, death, resurrection, and humanity in resurrection; hence, the Spirit of resurrection is an aggregate Spirit.
[46]  It is the Spirit who explains Christ to us, especially concerning how Christ was God who became flesh, how He was a man, how He became our Savior, how He is the King, and how He is the Most High God.
[47]  Before the Spirit enters into us to carry out these six things, He must first do one thing.
[48]  CHAPTER EIGHT WHAT IS GAINED THROUGH REGENERATION THE NECESSITY OF REGENERATION
[49]  There are two reasons that man must be regenerated: one reason relates to a higher purpose, and the other to a lower.
[50]  The lower purpose is that our human life is wicked and corrupt.
[51]  The higher purpose is that even if our human life were good, it still would be related merely to the created life rather than to the uncreated life of God.
[52]  We must be regenerated because we do not have the life of God; only by regeneration can we have the uncreated, eternal life of God.
[53]  Regeneration also causes us to gain seven things: the life of God, the law of life, a new heart, a new spirit, the Spirit, Christ, and the Triune God.
[54]  God s life enables us to be what God is and do what God does, which means that we can be like God and live out God because all that God is and does come from His life.
[55]  The laws of life that the life of God brings into us are the laws spoken of in Hebrews 8:10, which have been imparted into our mind and inscribed on our heart.
[56]  The laws of the Old Testament are the laws that God wrote with characters on stone tablets outside of man Exo 34:1, 28 , but the laws of life are the laws that God has written with His life on our heart within us.
[57]  Likewise, the natural laws contained in the life of God are its natural abilities; they enable us to spontaneously know how God desires us to act, how to be pleasing to Him, and how to live Him.
[58]  Therefore, when God regenerates us, He renews our old, hardened heart by softening it to become a new heart, and He renews our old, deadened spirit by enlivening it to become a new spirit.
[59]  The Lord said in John 14:16-17 that He would ask the Father to give us the Spirit, who would dwell in us as another Comforter.
[60]  Following the Son s ascension, He gave the Spirit as another Comforter; that is, God sent His Son as the Spirit to be our Comforter in another form.
[61]  Romans 8:9-10 shows that the Spirit of God dwelling in us is the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us, and the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us is Christ dwelling in us.
[62]  When we grow in His life into His image and become like Him, we grow into the image of God and become like God because He is the image of God.
[63]  Since this life is in us, it enables us to live out the image of God and to live out God.
[64]  According to the teaching of the Bible, there are seven main aspects of the Spirit s work in us: He works as the indwelling Spirit, as the Comforter, as the Spirit of reality, as the Spirit of life, as the seal, as the pledge, and as the anointing.
[65]  As the seal, the Holy Spirit seals us with God Himself.
[66]  The Bible emphasizes the work of the Spirit in us as the anointing ointment 1 John 2:27 , the work of Christ in us as our life, and the work of God in us for the accomplishment of His will.
[67]  Romans 8:6 says, The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.
[68]  No matter what action we take, no matter what kind of living we have, and no matter what we do, the sense of life within us causes us to know whether we are touching God, and it proves to us whether we are living in or outside of God.
[69]  For instance, when a person is giving a message, the sense of life will give him a feeling and prove him within so that he will know while he is speaking whether he is in God or outside of God and whether he is touching God.
[70]  Concerning the fellowship of life, please refer to chapter 6 of The Knowledge of Life.
[71]  First John 1:2-3 says, We the apostles ...report to you the believers the eternal life...that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
[72]  As soon as we obtain the life of God within us, this life enables us to have the fellowship of life.
[73]  This means that the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, the fellowship of life, causes us to become one with God, to be mingled with God.
[74]  When God created man in the beginning, he saw that man was good Gen 1:31 .
[75]  The life of God depends on the Holy Spirit, and it is through the Holy Spirit that this life enters and lives in us.
[76]  This shows clearly that the Holy Spirit causes us to experience the life of God.
[77]  This means that the Spirit of God moves, requires, and urges us within, causing us to have the fellowship which comes from the life of God.
[78]  Only when we are living and walking in the Spirit by setting our mind on the Spirit can we enjoy the fellowship of the life of God in a practical way.
[79]  As we learn to touch the Spirit in fellowship, we must realize that the one thing that can distract our spirit, or we may say, that can distract us from touching the Spirit, is our soul.
[80]  Our soul is a distraction, a powerful distraction, which hinders us from touching the Spirit.
[81]  ONLY IN THE SPIRIT THE SENSE OF LIFE One Sense with Five Aspects
[82]  First, the sense of life comes from the life of God; second, it comes from the law of life; third, it comes from the Holy Spirit; fourth, it comes from Christ; and fifth, it comes from God.
[83]  Moreover, because the law of life comes out from the life of God and is the function of this life, the five are one.
[84]  This sense of life is comprised of five aspects life, the law of life, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God.
[85]  THE SENSE OF THE SPIRIT AND KNOWING THE SPIRIT Life Being the Content and the Issue of the Spirit
[86]  When Romans 8 speaks of the Spirit, it indicates that life is related to the Spirit the Spirit of life v. 2 and the mind of the Spirit is life v. 6, ASV . Life is the first thing that is related to the Spirit.
[87]  The Spirit of life shows that life is the content of the Spirit.
[88]  When we touch life, we touch the content of the Spirit, and we also touch the Spirit Himself.
[89]  The mind of the Spirit is life also proves that life is the issue of the Spirit.
[90]  TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT THE SOUL VERSUS THE SPIRIT
[91]  A person who lives by his soul may be good, proper, and nice, but he does not understand or desire spiritual things.
[92]  LEARNING TO TURN FROM THE SOUL TO THE SPIRIT
[93]  The fellowship of life is in the spirit because fellowship is of life, and life is in the spirit.
[94]  Before we are saved, we lived in the soul, that is, in the mind, emotion, and will.
[95]  God uses the environment to strike, break, and deal with us repeatedly in order to break our self our mind, emotion, and will so that His life can be added into us and manifested more from us.
[96]  There is a crucial truth in the Bible related to three lives and four laws.
[97]  If we desire to clearly understand the condition of our inner spiritual life or if we desire to be freed from sin so that we can lead an overcoming life, we must have a thorough understanding of this basic truth.
[98]  These three lives the life of man, the life of Satan, and the life of God exist simultaneously within a saved one.
[99]  The life of man was originally innocent and simple, without knowledge of sin, because after man was created, he was very good in God s eyes 1:31 .
[100]  Thus, these three lives possess three absolutely different natures: the nature of man s created life is good and upright, Satan s fallen life is evil and corrupted, and God s divine life is holy and good.
[101]  His desire is not for us to stay away from evil and be good; instead, His desire is that we would stay away from both good and evil and live out God Himself.
[102]  He does not desire for us to merely reject a heart of hatred and live out a heart of love; rather, He desires for us to reject both a hating heart and a loving heart and live out God Himself.
[103]  When we reject Satan s life and its thoughts of hatred and when we also deny our own life and its thoughts that originate from our own love, we will practically experience the death of the cross; that is, we will be standing in the place of death to allow God s life to be lived out of us.
[104]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN FOUR LAWS THE DEFINITION OF THE FOUR LAWS
[105]  Three lives and four laws are the foundation of the spiritual experience of Christians.
[106]  The three lives are the life of man, the life of Satan, and the life of God.
[107]  These two chapters, which specifically speak of the matter of law, refer to four different laws: the law of God, the law of good in the mind, the law of sin in our members, and the law of the Spirit of life.
[108]  Finally, the law of the Spirit of life 8:2 enables us to live in the life of God.
[109]  The law of good is in our mind, that is, in our soul.
[110]  We have three persons God, man, and Satan with three lives the life of God, the life of man, and the life of Satan in our three parts spirit, soul, and body with three natures life, good, and evil.
[111]  The law of God s life enables man to live out the divine life, the law of man s life prompts man to do good, and the law of Satan s life causes man to sin.
[112]  Man s way of improving his behavior is by developing the good life he received through creation, but God s way of deliverance is by His Spirit and life.
[113]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE TWO IMPORTANT MATTERS
[114]  When God created man, the life He gave to man, apart from the angelic life, was the highest created life, but He did not give man the uncreated life of God.
[115]  God created life for man, but He did not give man His own life; however, He prepared a spirit in man as an organ to receive Him.
[116]  In like manner, we have a spirit as an organ for receiving God, that is, for receiving the life of God.
[117]  SPREADING TO THE SOUL, AND THEN TO THE BODY
[118]  Once the Spirit enters our spirit, the center of our whole being is stirred up and the life of God begins to spread outward until it reaches every part of our soul our mind, emotion, and will and eventually, it spreads even to our body.
[119]  The law of life is called the law of the Spirit of life in the Bible Rom 8:2 .
[120]  With regard to this designation, there is a special relationship between this law and God s life and the Spirit.
[121]  When referring to God s life the stress is on His nature, and when referring to His person the stress is on the Spirit.
[122]  God s way of salvation is through renewing us, and this renewing is fully accomplished by the Holy Spirit.
[123]  Our mind was originally set on the things of the world, but through the operation of the law of life in our mind, our mind is being renewed and can be set on the things of God Rom 12:2; 8:6 .
[124]  Furthermore, whenever we set our mind on worldly and sinful things, the law of life within us causes us to feel uneasy because we have violated that law.
[125]  The law of life begins its operation from our spirit and advances to our mind, regulating our mind and activating our mind to function so that it can be set on the things of God and on spiritual things.
[126]  According to the same principle, when the renewing Holy Spirit enters into our emotion, the law of life operates in our emotion and causes our emotion to spontaneously love God, incline toward God, and delight in God.
[127]  God takes our spirit as the base and spreads outward from our spirit through the law of life to reach every part of our soul.
[128]  This is the relationship between the law of life and our spirit and soul.
[129]  In itself the law of life is unable to move; however, when our heart is open to God, the law is able to operate in us.
[130]  We need to learn to deal with our soul until our mind is sober and no longer wanders, until our emotion loves God and inclines toward God, until our will is soft and able to submit to God, and until our conscience is at peace without any feeling of condemnation.
[131]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN LIVING IN THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENTS
[132]  In order for the law of life to operate in us, we need to fulfill two requirements: loving God and obeying the initial sense of life.
[133]  In contrast, the life of God in us is full of emotion; thus, we enjoy not only power but also the love of God.
[134]  It speaks of Christ dwelling in our hearts so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God v. 19 . Then it says that His dwelling in our hearts is a matter of love, enabling us to enjoy the power of the life of God, which can do superabundantly above all that we ask or think.
[135]  If there were no history of love, no traffic of love, and no fellowship of love between us and God, we would not have much knowledge of the life of God or much experience of the power of God.
[136]  Love and obedience are two requirements for the operation of the law of life within us.
[137]  If we are able to love and are willing to obey, the law of life will spontaneously operate in us and manifest its function.
[138]  In order to experience the power of the Lord s death and resurrection, we need to live in the law of life and fellowship with the Lord continuously so that we can let the law of life, that is, the Spirit and the life of God, circulate and operate in us.
[139]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE LAW OF LIFE AND THE ANOINTING THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD
[140]  There are two aspects of our knowledge of God: one is inward knowledge and the other is outward knowledge.
[141]  Both Hebrews 8:11 and 1 John 2:27 speak of our inward knowledge of God.
[142]  First John 2 speaks of the anointing, that is, the revelation of the Holy Spirit, which also enables us to know God inwardly.
[143]  John 17:3 and Ephesians 1:17 also speak of our inward knowledge of God with a difference in emphasis on life and the Holy Spirit.
[144]  Both Hebrews 8:11 and John 17:3 speak of the life in us that enables us to inwardly know God, and 1 John 2:27 and Ephesians 1:17 speak of the Holy Spirit in us that enables us to inwardly know God.
[145]  All the prophets in the Old Testament typify the Holy Spirit as the anointing ointment in the New Testament.
[146]  In the New Testament the Holy Spirit, the anointing ointment, has entered into us personally and directly to be our Prophet.
[147]  Similarly, the law in the Old Testament declared the nature of God s life; in the New Testament the nature of God s life has entered into us directly so that the outward law is no longer needed.
[148]  Everything related to the nature of God s life is made known to us through the law of life; everything related to God s infinite self is made known to us through the Holy Spirit as the anointing ointment.
[149]  Under normal circumstances a Christian will pursue the growth of life after being saved.
[150]  Many Christians, however, have mistaken views and pursuits because they do not know what the growth of life truly is, even though they have paid a high price and are not lacking in love for the Lord.
[151]  Furthermore, the increase of power is not the growth of life.
[152]  CHAPTER NINETEEN KNOWING CHRIST WHAT THINGS WERE GAINS, NOW BEING COUNTED
[153]  The phrase not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ means that Paul no longer relied on himself to do good in order to have some kind of righteousness; rather, he let Christ live Himself out as righteousness.
[154]  This is the same as saying, it is no longer I, but Christ Gal 2:20 ; in other words, we need to stop and let Christ live.
[155]  We should not rely on our own effort to do good and to serve God zealously; instead, Christ in us, who has clothed Himself with us, is the One who should do good and serve God.
[156]  In matters related to our service to God and in our daily living, we do not need to rely on ourselves; rather, we should stop ourselves and let Christ live out of us.
[157]  The center of Philippians 3 is the matter of being conformed to the mold of the Lord s death.
[158]  Learning to live in the fellowship of life does not mean that we need to continuously pray behind closed doors.
[159]  When everything around us is peaceful, we may be like Mary, who sat calmly at the Lord s feet and listened to His words.
[160]  But as soon as we hear that our children are sick, we panic and cannot be quiet even for two minutes to ask the Lord where we should take our children.
[161]  If a man who is full of emotion has been broken in God s hands, he can remain calm and unhurried even when he hears that his child is sick.
[162]  Philippians 3:9 says, And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith.
[163]  We all know that the Lord Jesus died and resurrected and that He is in us.
[164]  Christ died and resurrected, but is He dead or alive in us?
