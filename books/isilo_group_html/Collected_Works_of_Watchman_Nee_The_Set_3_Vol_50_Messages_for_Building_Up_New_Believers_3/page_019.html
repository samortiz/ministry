A Clear Distinction<br />between Males and Females</h2><p>The Bible forbids men to wear women's clothing and vice versa (Deut. 22:5). The tendency today is to annul the distinction between men's and women's clothing. Already this distinction is becoming less and less. If the world continues this trend, there will soon be no difference between the two. All the brothers and sisters have to pay attention to this matter. Men should not wear women's clothing, and women should not wear men's clothing. You must maintain the separation established by God. Men must wear men's clothes and women must wear women's clothes. Anything which confuses the distinction in gender does not glorify God. God's people and His children must learn to have proper distinction in their clothing.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Sisters' Clothing</h2><p>Let us talk about the sisters' clothing first. Generally speaking, the matter of clothing is simpler with the brothers than with the sisters. The sisters' clothing poses more problems than the brothers' clothing. We will read two portions of the Word carefully.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Costly Apparel and Meekness</h2><p>First Peter 3:3-5 says, "Let your adorning not be the outward plaiting of hair and putting on of gold or clothing with garments, but the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is very costly in the sight of God. For in this manner formerly the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves."</p><p>This is the only passage in the Bible that contains the phrase holy women. The phrase holy men is found in many portions of the Word. But this is the only place that speaks of "holy women." For in this manner the holy women adorned themselves, subjecting themselves to their own husbands. The holy women adorned themselves with a meek and quiet spirit.</p><p>Peter's word indicates that many sisters tended to adorn themselves with plaiting of hair, gold, and apparel. He did not feel happy about the way they dressed. The plaiting of hair and ornaments of jewelry are not suitable, nor is beautiful apparel. We are not saying that sisters should be careless in their clothing. If they are careless, it means that there is something wrong with their character. If a sister dresses herself in a careless, untidy, and unclean way, it means that she is a careless and loose person. This is not what Peter meant.</p><p>Peter was saying that it is wrong for women to plait their hair in the manner he described. The phrase plaiting of hair in the original text means to fashion the hair in many styles. Throughout history, many styles have been designed to plait the hair. Putting on of gold means to wear jewelry. Christians cannot do this. Clothing with garments may refer to colorful and stylish dresses. Peter's emphasis is that sisters should not adorn themselves with the plaiting of hair and the putting on of gold and costly garments. Instead, they should adorn themselves with a meek and quiet spirit.</p><p>Sometimes a woman dresses herself fancily yet has a temper like a lion. You cannot help but feel that her person is incompatible with what she wears. She would be better off not wearing fancy dresses at all. It is unfitting for a fancily dressed woman to shout in rage. If a woman is meek and submissive, she has put on good apparel already. A woman who serves God should not pay too much attention to her clothing. As Christians we should not place too much emphasis on clothing.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 50: Messages for Building Up New Believers (3) &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
