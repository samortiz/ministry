<h2 class="head1">OUR CONSECRATION SPEAKS OF<br />OUR VALUATION OF THE LORD</h2><p>Our consecration speaks of our valuation of the Lord. The more we treasure the Lord, the more we will give our all to Him. We all have something that we treasure. Handing oneself over does not merely mean handing over treasures but handing over all. In the past the church was too timid; it only dared to ask the saints to offer their treasures. Today the church should no longer be timid. It has to proclaim boldly to the saints: "We have to offer up everything to the Lord. When we do not know Him, we only offer up our treasures. When we know His glory, we will say to Him, `Not only am I offering my past and present treasures; I am offering everything I will have in the future. Please accept them.' " If we try to hold anything back, our inner being will feel suffocated; we will not be comfortable unless we consecrate. Our consecration speaks of our valuation of the Lord. It shows how much we are willing to pay for the Lord. In Judas's eyes the Lord was worth only thirty pieces of silver, the price of a slave (Matt. 26:15; Exo. 21:32). To the world, our Lord is a slave. It is willing to pay thirty pieces of silver for Him and no more. How much are we willing to pay?</p><p>Allow me to tell a story. After the war all the brothers and sisters were struggling with a mean living. At that time a brother proposed marriage to a sister, and they became engaged. The brother came to me and said, "I am getting married. I have never asked anyone for anything in my whole life. Now I am asking for help for my wedding." He needed a large sum of money. I asked, "Presently, everyone is tight financially. Is not this sum a little too large?" He answered, "To me, it is too little." Of course, it was seven or eight times more than what other brothers would spend. He thought for a long while, and then answered me in a very emphatic way, "To me, nothing is too much to spend on her." I had nothing to say. I gave him what he asked for. Two months later, I found myself preaching to him about selling all and offering everything to God. Thank God, he heard my words and did sell everything.</p><p>Many times we feel that we are not doing enough even when we offer everything to God. We feel that we are not doing enough when we lay our all, our life, and even our blood on the altar. This is like the brother who loved his fianc√©e so much that nothing was too much to him. If we really treasure the Lord, nothing will be too much or too expensive to offer to Him. We would not be ashamed to pour out our most cherished and precious treasures on Him. He is worthy of our total abandonment. Is our valuation of Him so high that it transcends everything?</p><h2 class="head1">ON BEING AN ABSOLUTE CHRISTIAN</h2><p>If we want to consecrate ourselves, we have to do it absolutely. We have to forsake everything to follow the Lord. One brother in Shanghai only had two dictionaries. These were his total possessions; he had nothing else. When he heard the message on forsaking all to follow the Lord, he went home and asked his father if there was anything in the house that belonged to him. His father answered that the two dictionaries were the only items. He took the two dictionaries and handed them over to the church. It is not a matter of consecrating more or less; it is a matter of consecrating one's all. When the poor widow offered up her two mites, the Lord's heart was touched (Luke 21:2). The Lord praised Mary's consecration and said that she had done what she could (Mark 14:8). For the gospel and God's house, we have to offer up everything. Either we do not become a Christian at all, or we have to be such a kind of Christian. We cannot hold back anything. This is what it means to be absolute. A brother in Shanghai once said, "It is getting harder and harder to be a Christian. When others slap our cheek, we have to turn the other cheek." Actually, this brother does not know the Lord. He does not know how to exult in Him. His only reaction is to grit his teeth. It is a suffering to him. If we turn our right cheek immediately to those who slap our left cheek, we will go home full of joy. But if we remain in ourselves, hesitating to strike back only because we think this is what a Christian should do and keeping our anger within, we will only suffer. Only those who abandon themselves in an absolute way will find joy. If both of our cheeks are slapped, we will exult in the Lord. We will feel that we have been given the honor to demonstrate the proper Christian standard and measure. We have to be a Christian absolutely. We should not only deny everything; we should deny ourselves. Once I was sick with tuberculosis. Even now I still have trouble with my heart. If we do not deny ourselves, we can never be happy. Today a brother is here. Suppose we try to help him beyond our capacity. Suppose we help him until we hurt, until we start digging into our own necessities. When our hands become empty, we will kneel down and praise the Lord. We will not need to plead for God's mercy. Such a consecration will fill us with joy for a whole month. The Christian joy is not merely a joy on the surface but a joy in the heart.</p><p>Brother Philip Luan was a very good giver. After he became a Christian, he closed down his tobacco factory. One brother tried to borrow a hundred dollars from him, but he only had twenty dollars. He went home, pawned the only blanket he had, a Russian-made one of top quality, and scraped together a hundred dollars to give to the brother. When his wife returned, she found that the blanket was gone. Brother Luan comforted her, saying, "We are giving it away to the Lord. We are the Lord's slaves. We are here to serve the Lord. It is only right that we offer up everything to Him."</p><p>Paul testified to the Corinthians that though he was poor, he enriched many (2 Cor. 6:10). He also said that our Lord Jesus was rich but had become poor for our sake so that we would become rich because of His poverty (8:9). Our Lord denied Himself to make us rich. We can touch the same reality in the self-sacrifice of Paul.</p><p>An absolute consecration will fill us with joy. We cannot say that it is wrong for Christians to have reservations, but we can say that a consecration with reservations invariably comes short. We have to be a Christian absolutely, definitely, and thoroughly. This is the only way to be filled with joy. This kind of joy is unknown to the Gentiles. I hope to see Christians in Hong Kong full of praises in their mouth and joy in their heart. The more absolute we are, the more we will be filled with joy inwardly.</p><p>This is the reason the Bible always puts trials and joy together. I do not know what Paul's ordinary tone of voice was, but I do know that when he sang in the prison cell, even the prisoners and the angels inclined their ears (Acts 16:25). When a person willingly takes up the suffering of relinquishing all for the Lord, how great will be his joy and how lofty will be his tune! Perhaps he will suffer much ridicule from men. Perhaps even Christians will say to him, "I have been a Christian for thirty years. I have never done what you are doing. Perhaps you have a problem with your mind. Perhaps you have gone mad!" He has to answer them, saying, "Lovers of the Lord down through the ages have done this. Brethren in the last century like J. N. Darby, Sir Bennet, William Kelly, and many other leading brothers forsook their all within a single day. They gave up everything to follow the Lord." Griffith Thomas praised the Brethren for being the best among all God's children in rightly dividing the truth. D. M. Panton said that the Brethren movement far exceeded the Reformation in its influence. It was a common practice among hundreds and thousands of these brothers to give up everything. Some gave up their nobility. Others gave up their position, their degree, or their possessions. Their consecration brought in the church's revival. From them we have inherited the knowledge and assurance of God's salvation, the judgment of sin, the truth about the position of the church, the practice of forsaking all to follow the Lord, and other things. Of course, we have gone on and have become clearer concerning certain things.</p><p>The tide of the Spirit is forever onward. This is true not only of the truth concerning salvation and the position of the church but of the practice of forsaking all. What Brother Witness Lee did in Chefoo in 1943 was a strategic move of the Holy Spirit. It was a move of the Spirit, and no one could withstand it. All the brothers and sisters poured out their hearts and gave up their possessions, sometimes with tears and sometimes with laughter. As a result the truth was uplifted and recovered, and a revival was brought in. The work of the Holy Spirit was so strong that many brothers and sisters were compelled to offer their all. They could not have any peace otherwise.</p>
