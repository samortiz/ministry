 <h2 class="head1">IN THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>In the objective aspect of the truth there are four main factors: Christ (1 Cor. 2:2; Col. 2:2), the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:8), life (John 1:4), and the church (Eph. 1:22b-23; 3:4; 5:32). These four factors in the truth have been my subjects in the ministry for years. Each one of these factors is a great topic, and all of them are included in the new way. The reason we have to change our practice to the new way is to carry out these four items. We want to carry out Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</p>
<p>Our purpose, our goal, and our destiny is not merely to preach the gospel to save souls. Preaching the gospel for others&rsquo; salvation is a means to accomplish the purpose that can fulfill God&rsquo;s economy concerning Christ and the Spirit through the divine life for the church. To accomplish such a goal we need the way to save sinners, to make sinners sons of God so they can be brought into the church. Otherwise, we will not have the new materials to accomplish such a great universal building, the building up of the Body of Christ. To visit people, to have home meetings, and to group people together into group meetings are not our goal; they are simply the means to reach the goal. Our goal is to have the building up of the Body of Christ. This is the very goal, the destiny, according to God&rsquo;s eternal economy, which He purposed in Christ according to His good pleasure. This building has to be of Christ, of the Spirit, by the divine life, and through the church.</p>
<p>From 1962 to 1984 in the United States we concentrated our ministry on Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church. When we pick up the matter of visiting people with the gospel by knocking on their doors, this does not mean that we drop these four major items. In practicing the new way, we have never dropped these four items. Since I returned to Taipei in 1984 to begin the practice of the new way, I never departed from Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church. When I spoke to the trainees in Taipei, I spoke on these four subjects. The first few messages I gave to the full-time trainees in Taipei were on the Triune God. I believe that the four factors of Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church cannot leave those of us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Even if we wanted to drop them, we could not because they have been deeply rooted in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE SUBJECTIVE ASPECT OF PRACTICE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>The other four factors of the new way are in the subjective aspect of practice. The first item of practice is to visit people by knocking on their doors for the preaching of the gospel (Matt. 22:9-14; Luke 14:23). Our experiment on this item was completely successful based on the fact that thirty-eight thousand people in Taipei believed and were baptized in less than two years. To get thirty-eight thousand people to receive the Lord and be baptized required a lot of labor, yet this was accomplished. Furthermore, I have received hundreds of encouraging letters from the six continents testifying that this new way to preach the gospel works so well.</p>
<p>The practice of visiting people to preach the gospel is the biblical way. God visited Adam (Gen. 3:8-9) and preached the gospel to him (3:15). The Lord Jesus visited people (Luke 19:1-10; John 4:3-15), and He sent the twelve disciples to visit people (Matt. 10:5-8, 11-13). Furthermore, He sent the seventy to go to every city and place to seek the sons of peace (Luke 10:1-6). After His resurrection, He charged all of His disciples to go to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). Can the nations be discipled if we do not visit people? We have to go. To go is to visit.</p>
<p>The early missionaries opened up the old and conservative China because they paid the price to visit people with the gospel. Because of their visiting, the Lord opened up the Chinese race to the gospel. We owe much to this first group of missionaries. They did not have the light that we do, but in this matter of living to God&rsquo;s gospel, these devoted God-men were incomparable. Through their marvelous and even legendary mission work of visiting people&rsquo;s homes and knocking on their doors, the Lord had a way to spread the gospel throughout China. We have to take this biblical way of preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>In the subjective aspect of the practice of the scriptural way, we stress the preaching of the gospel by visiting people. We have to go to visit people to bring God, Christ, the Spirit, the gospel, the holy Word, salvation, and God&rsquo;s presence to them. When we visit people, we bring all these heavenly and divine things to their homes, to their families. We do not need to invite people to our place to hear the gospel. We need to go with all these wonderful, heavenly, and divine things as gifts to impart into people. We have to take the way of visiting people to preach the gospel. I do not mean that we should never invite people to hear the gospel or that inviting people is wrong. But there are different ways of doing anything, and we must choose and take the top way. If we are going to travel somewhere today, we will not take a mule wagon. When I travel long distances, I like to take a 747, which is the fastest and most efficient way. To knock on people&rsquo;s doors for the preaching of the gospel is the best way to take. When it comes to preaching the gospel, visiting people by knocking on their doors is higher and better than any other way. Only by taking this way could we have baptized thirty-eight thousand people in less than two years. This is not the only way of preaching the gospel, but this is the best way.</p>
<p>If I were to travel from Los Angeles across the Pacific Ocean to Taiwan on a junk, it would take me at least six months. I would not be wise if I took that way when I can fly to Taiwan on a 747 from Los Angeles and be there within twelve hours. This is a wonderful age with wonderful modern means of transportation. We do not need to preach the gospel by the poor way of &ldquo;a mule wagon&rdquo; or &ldquo;a junk.&rdquo; Rather, we can take the best way to preach the gospel by visiting people, knocking on their doors to find the sons of peace. In Luke 10 the Lord said that He sent the seventy as lambs in the midst of wolves to find the sons of peace (vv. 3-6). We found thirty-eight thousand sons of peace in Taipei within less than two years, not by setting up a love feast and inviting them to come but by knocking on doors. I say again that visiting people by knocking on their doors is not the only way to preach the gospel, but it is the top way, the best way.</p>
