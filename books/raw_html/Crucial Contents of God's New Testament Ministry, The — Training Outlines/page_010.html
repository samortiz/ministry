hence, it is called the oneness of the Spirit, which oneness the believers should keep diligently in the uniting bond of peace&#151;Eph. 4:3.</li>	<li>In the whole universe there is only one, unique Body of Christ, with the Triune God as its contents&#151;Eph. 4:4-6:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The one Spirit is the essence of its contents.</li>		<li>The one Lord is the element of its contents.</li>		<li>God the Father is the source of its contents.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>This oneness is partly of the faith and partly of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at which all the believers need to arrive&#151;Eph. 4:13.</li>	</ol></li><li>The fellowship of the Body of Christ:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The fellowship of the Body of Christ is the fellowship of the apostles&#151;the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God&#151;Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3.</li>	<li>It is the fellowship for the Lord's unique recovery.</li>	<li>It is the fellowship of the local churches:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The local churches are many in different localities&#151;Rev. 1:11.</li>		<li>Locally the local churches are separated in existence, but universally they are not divided in essence.</li>		<li>The local churches need to fellowship with all the genuine local churches throughout the earth.</li>		<li>Every local church needs to receive all kinds of genuine believers in Christ&#151;Rom. 14:1-6; 15:1-7.</li>		<li>A believer should be kept away from the fellowship of a local church only because of three things:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Being divisive&#151;Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10.</li>			<li>Being heretical&#151;2 John 7-11.</li>			<li>Committing gross sins and living in them&#151;1 Cor. 5:9-13.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>The blending of the Body of Christ:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God has blended the Body together&#151;1 Cor. 12:24:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>There should be a blending of all the individual members of the Body of Christ.</li>		<li>There should be a blending of all the churches in a certain district.</li>		<li>There should be a blending of all the co-workers.</li>		<li>There should be a blending of all the elders.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The local churches, though necessary for practicality, are not the goal of God's economy but the procedure to reach that goal, which is the unique Body of Christ.</li>	<li>The Lord blended the seven churches in Asia by writing them one epistle composed of seven epistles to each of them respectively&#151;Rev. 1&#151;3.</li>	<li>The apostle blended the churches in Colossae and Laodicea by writing one epistle to each of the two churches respectively and asking them to read the two epistles reciprocally&#151;Col. 4:16.</li>	<li>Such a blending is not social but the blending of the very Christ whom the individual members, the district churches, the co-workers, and the elders enjoy, experience, and partake of.</li>	<li>Such a blending is for the building up of the universal Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem as the final goal of God's economy according to His good pleasure&#151;Eph. 1:23; Rev. 21:2; Eph. 1:9-10.</li>	</ol></li><li>The consummation of the Body of Christ:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Body of Christ, an organic building of the God-men who are perfected in life as the representatives of a local church, as Zion within Jerusalem, will consummate the New Jerusalem in the millennium.</li>	<li>This consummation will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as God's increase and expression for eternity.</li>	</ol></li></ol>
