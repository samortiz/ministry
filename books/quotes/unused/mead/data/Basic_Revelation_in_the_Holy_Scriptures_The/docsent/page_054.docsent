   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOLD, PRECIOUS STONES, AND PEARLS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The wall of the city is made of jasper upon a foundation of twelve different precious stones Rev 21:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Precious stones were first created and then transformed by pressure and heat.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are not merely natural, but were created and then transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament there is the strong thought of transformation 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The twelve gates are twelve pearls 21:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Pearls have also gone through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Pearls are produced by oysters in the waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the oyster is wounded by a particle of sand, it secretes its life juice around the sand and makes it into a precious pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this process we can see the death, the killing, and the secretion of the life juice to produce a pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The entire city is built of gold, precious stones, and pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There we will not need to sweep the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no dust!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the created beings have been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE DIVINE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>WITH TRANSFORMED HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul in 1 Corinthians 3 says the unique foundation has been laid, but we must be careful how we build upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can build with two categories of materials: gold, silver, precious stones or wood, grass, stubble 3:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wood, grass, and stubble all become dust after they are burned, but gold, silver, and precious stones cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Paul's concept the natural created man is wood, hay, and stubble; the regenerated, transformed men are gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Peter came to the Lord Jesus, he was a "dusty" man, a man made of dust Gen 3:19 , because he was born of the Adamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Adam was made of dust, and Peter was born a dusty man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus called him Cephas Gk., Peter , which means a stone John 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The changing of Simon's name by the Lord Jesus to Peter indicated that Peter would be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was the reason Peter was very strong in this concept, even in the writing of his first Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said that the Lord Jesus is the living stone 1 Pet 2:4 , and that as we come to this living stone, we all become living stones to be built up a spiritual house 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spiritual house is not built of wood, hay, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is built of transformed materials.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because our mentality is fully occupied by the natural thought of ethics, philosophy, and morality, we overlook this matter in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The entire New Testament, however, is saturated with this thought of the divine building of transformed humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The conclusion of the Bible is a holy city composed of gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
