   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGES FOR BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NEW BELIEVERS 1 CHAPTER ONE BAPTISM Scripture Reading: Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; 22:16; 1 Pet 3:20-21; Rom 6:3-4; Col 2:12</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Baptism is a great subject in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to be clear about two aspects concerning baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, before we are baptized, we need to be clear as to what baptism can do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, after we are baptized, we need to look backward and ask, "What is the significance of baptism?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the first case, the baptism pool and the water are before us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we are going to be baptized, we should ask ourselves, "What can baptism do for me?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After our baptism, we need to ask, "What is the meaning of my baptism?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One is a question posed in foresight, and the other is a question posed in hindsight.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The former touches one's knowledge prior to baptism, and the latter, one's understanding after baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I. WHAT BAPTISM DOES FOR A PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned" Mark 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse shows what baptism does for a person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A. Baptism Saving Man from the World</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"He who believes and is baptized shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I suppose that all Protestants are a little afraid of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, they dare not read it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever they read this verse, they change it to, "He who believes and is saved shall be baptized."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the Lord's Word does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to avoid the error of Catholicism, the Protestants deliberately go around God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, as they evade the error of Catholicism, they fall into another error.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord's Word is clear: "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man has no authority to change it to, "He who believes and is saved shall be baptized."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Salvation Being a Deliverance from the World</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us now pay attention to the meaning of the word salvation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is a person being saved from?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the Bible, a man is saved from the world, not hell.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The opposite of eternal life is perdition, but the Bible does not regard salvation as the opposite of perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible shows us that salvation is one's deliverance from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as a person is in the world, he is already in perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us consider man's condition before God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today man does not have to do anything to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I will not perish because I have killed someone, and I will not be saved from perdition because I have not killed someone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fact is that the whole world is perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From among the perishing ones, God has pulled us out and saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The whole world is perishing corporately, but God is saving men one by one, individually.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God does not catch all the fish from the sea and then separate the good from the bad, assigning some to salvation while destining others to perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the fish in the sea are perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those which are caught by God are saved; the rest remain in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the matter of salvation and perdition has nothing to do with whether or not you have believed or how good your conduct is; it has to do with your location.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are in the boat, you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you are still in the sea, you are perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You may not have done anything, but as long as you are in the world, that is enough for you to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It does not matter whether you are good or bad, a gentleman or a villain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It does not matter whether or not you live by your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as you are in the world, you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you have not left that place, you are condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Salvation Being a Matter of Position</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because Adam sinned and became a sinner, all men became sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man need not sin to be qualified as a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All have become sinners through one man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today God has saved you from among many men.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you are on the world's side, no matter what kind of person you are, you are opposed to God, and you are God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Your position is wrong; it is a perishing position, one that leads to perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you are a person in the world, you are perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The word salvation has been used freely among us and with much confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is a distinction between salvation and obtaining eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Obtaining eternal life is a personal matter, but salvation is a matter not only of receiving the eternal life personally but also of coming out from a wrong corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Brothers and sisters, are you clear about this distinction?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Receiving eternal life is a personal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Salvation, however, is not just a personal matter; it has to do with the corporate body to which you formerly belonged.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Salvation means coming out of one corporate body into another.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The receiving of eternal life speaks of what one has entered into; it does not speak of what one has come out of.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Salvation includes both a coming out of and an entering in. Therefore, the scope of salvation is wider than that of receiving eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It includes being delivered from the world, that is, coming out of the world.</S>
