   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE MARTYRS Ignatius</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ignatius accepted the gospel after hearing it from John in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was put into prison for preaching it to the Roman emperor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was severely beaten.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Roman soldiers forced him to put his hands to the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They forced him to dip his fingers in burning oil and to put it between his legs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They also scorched his skin with a red hot iron.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the end he was thrown to the beasts and eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before he went to Rome, he knew that he was going to die, and he wrote a letter to Polycarp, saying, "Before I reach Rome, I must fight with the beasts and be bound and led to the cruel ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The better I treat them, the more cruel they will treat me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Day by day I am beaten severely by them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How I yearn to see the mouth of the beasts and to find death coming upon me soon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here I am learning to look beyond the seen to the unseen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I only desire to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am willing to see my body torn to pieces and the pain of the lion's claw and the beastly scourge come upon me, if I can only know Christ and gain Him."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Polycarp</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Polycarp was the bishop of Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he was eighty-six years old, persecutors sought after him, but he escaped.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One night in a dream, he saw his bed on fire, and he knew that he was going to be martyred for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When his captors came for him, they were amazed at the calmness and peace on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He asked that he be given an hour to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although his captors somewhat repented of their actions, they still handed him to the governor and prepared for his burning at the stake outside the city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Realizing that he was advanced in age, they were somewhat hesitant to put him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They promised that they would let him go if he would only deny Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But he said, "I cannot deny Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eighty-six years the Lord has never changed His grace; He has never done me any wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can I deny Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The men lit the fire while he continued to praise God in its midst.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The soldiers pierced his side and much blood came out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After his lower body was burnt, he could still speak, and he said, "Thank God that I can have the opportunity to testify today with my life."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Twelve believers were burned alive together with him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was indeed a person who knew the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perpetua</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perpetua was twenty-six years old when she was martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She was well educated, and her family was very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When she was caught, she had a child with her.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Her father loved her very much and went to prison to persuade her to give up her faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She was strong in faith, however, and was not moved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Her father became angry and said he would no longer come to see her.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When she was brought before the magistrate, she was ordered to offer a sacrifice to the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She refused and was sent to the cellars.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Two stewards taking care of jailed believers tried their best to allow her to devote some of her rest times to nurse her child.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She realized that she did not have long to live, and she committed her child to her own mother.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later her father could not stand the thought of her suffering and came to persuade her again, gently and with much pleading.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She knew clearly that she had to give up everything for Christ, so she told her father, "May God's will be done."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The judge asked her to seriously consider her father's tears, her child's need, and her own life's perils.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She overcame all natural affection, ignored all sufferings in the mind and the flesh, and readily sacrificed all human love for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For His sake, she waited quietly for her time of execution.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A sister among the convicted called Felicitas was equally ready to give up her life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She gave birth to a daughter while in prison and committed the baby to another sister's care.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later the two sisters were taken to the beasts together.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After almost bleeding to death, they were pierced by executioners with swords to end their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This happened in March of A.D. 205.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Countless people were martyred about the same time.</S>
