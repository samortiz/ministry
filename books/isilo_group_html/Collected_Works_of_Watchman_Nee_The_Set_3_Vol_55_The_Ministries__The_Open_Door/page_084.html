The Lord has continuously added saved ones to our number. As a result of this, the church in Nanking sent someone here, and we held our first baptism meeting on June 4. We had the second baptism meeting on the twenty-third of this month. A total of thirty-four brothers and sisters were baptized into the Lord's name in the two meetings. We began having the Lord's table to remember the Lord on the same day (July 23). We all want to give glory and honor to our Father God and to the Christ on the throne. Amen.</p><p>We have just begun and are immature and weak, so we need all the churches to pray for us. May God have a clear way here. May He lead us and keep us until He comes.</p><p>From the brothers meeting in the Lord's name in Bangbu,<br />Shu Pei-zhi, Shao Yi-ming, Han Tseng-yu<br />July 23, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 1 Hua-Tung Li, Hua-Sheng Road, Bangbu, Anhwei province</p><h2 class="head2">News from K'un-ming<br />(Yunnan Province)</h2><p>Brother Dao-sheng, Brother Shao-zu, and Sister Bao Xue-jie went to Mongtze to preach the gospel, and a total of more than sixty people were baptized into the Lord in three different meetings. Thank the Lord for saving sinners. The brothers were there for more than two months and have now returned. Brother He Jun-yu of Weixi, who is about thirty years old, has gone to the remote border regions to preach the gospel (he comes from that area), and many people have come to the Lord. We have heard that there are sixteen places with meetings. Sister Yu-rui sent us the letter she sent to you, but we did not have an opportunity to get together with her before we received word on January 25 that she had gone to be with the Lord like the faithful witness Antipas! She was the only co-worker raised up by the Lord here who could speak the Yunnan dialect. Last year when she came to K'un-ming, she really wanted to go to Kuling to be edified, but was too late in returning. Now that she has gone to rest, the Lord's work has suffered a great loss; we are very saddened! The work there will be very difficult from now on!</p><p>Andrew Chen<br />February 7, 1950</p><p>It is very difficult to spread the work in K'un-ming at this time. The brothers and sisters all seem to have heavy burdens in spirit. The only place with gospel work apart from K'un-ming is Mongtze. But it is very immature and weak. A Tibetan brother, Jiang-Ba-o-se, is responsible for taking the lead there.</p><p>I am teaching mathematics at En-Guang Girls' Secondary School. I have nine classes a week plus tutorial lessons. I work for half a day and use the rest of the time for reading the Bible and visiting people. Brother Dao-sheng and I take turns bearing the responsibility for the message at the Thursday night new believers' meeting. Brother Dao-sheng is working for an architect. He has more time than I, and he bears more responsibility for the work of visitation in the church. The elder Brother Chen Ruo-tien bears the responsibility for edification of the believers on the Lord's Day morning and for the work of Bible study. (We are in Romans 8 in our Bible study.)</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Shao-zu<br />May 31</p><p>I have been in K'un-ming for about a year now and really am in debt to the Lord's work. I have discovered two matters in this past year: First, I have not learned enough about preaching the gospel, and I am unable to meet the church's need. Second, my personal growth is too immature, as I have not received enough dealings. I can only beg the Lord for much mercy.</p><p>I am now teaching school here and learning to serve God in the church at the same time. This has all been arranged by the elderly brothers; I did not make any choices. The Lord's arrangement is always good. I did not learn enough at Haiguanxiang last year. I really hope to attend the third session of edification meetings at Kuling....I am praying now, and if the Lord wills, I hope to return to Shanghai, attend the third session of training, and then return to K'un-ming. May the Lord have mercy on me, this miserable wretch.</p><p>How has the church in Shanghai been recently? I heard that several hundred people migrated to the Kiangsi Province. (Less than one hundred people went.&mdash;Editor) Thank the Lord! Who is responsible for the church in Nanchang? (Brother Fan Zhi-guang and others are responsible.&mdash;Editor) Did Brother David Hsu go to Nanchang? How have the brothers at Jiao-Tong University been lately? Greet them for me when you see them.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Shao-zu<br />June 5</p><p>Mailing Address: 3rd Floor, 312 Jinbi Road, K'un-ming, Yunnan province</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_083.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_085.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 84</div><br></body></html>
