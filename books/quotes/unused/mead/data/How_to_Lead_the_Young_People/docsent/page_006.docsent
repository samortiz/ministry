   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ADAPTING TO YOUNG PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fifth, all those who have a desire to do the young people's work need to learn how to match and adapt to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not ask them to adapt to you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You need to adapt to them to such an extent that you are like glue.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Glue adapts the best; there is not one place it cannot adapt to.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It adapts to flat surfaces, rugged places, twisted places, and places with corners.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Glue can be applied to any place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We who do the young people's work need to deal with our character to such an extent that we are just like glue.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If anyone wants to serve God, he must have a character that is not only strong but also pliant; he must be one who tempers strength with pliancy to adapt to others like glue.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, young people are facing stiff competition for the entrance to a higher school, and there is a prevailing atmosphere to go abroad to study.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After elementary school, they have to enter high school.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then after high school, they have to get into a university.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After graduation from university, they have to go abroad to further their studies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everyone is busy getting a higher education and going abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It seems very hard to do the young people's work because the young people are too busy to care about pursuing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But this perception is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We who do the young people's work should be like glue, so that it does not matter if a young person is soft or hard or if he is three-dimensional, flat, or a surface with bumps and dents; we still need to stick to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to go along with the young people and accommodate ourselves to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Are they busy with entering a higher school?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we work on them by going along with them in their preparation for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are they going abroad to study?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We still go along with them and adapt to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we cannot go with any of them to a foreign country, our care and concern for him will go with him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should work not only to the extent of gaining him but also to gain some people through him in that foreign country.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should work on him to such an extent that he will do the Lord's work in whatever university he goes to.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then as a result of his preaching of the gospel, he will gain some people there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, instead of regarding the prevailing trend of going abroad as a hindrance, we should consider it an outlet for our work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to correspond with the brothers and sisters who are studying abroad to continue communication with them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before they leave, we need to lead each of them to have a normal spiritual life, so that after they go out they will not only study for themselves but also work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You cannot, and must not, hope that everyone would give up entering a higher school or going abroad for further studies but would sit here waiting for you to work on them, just like a piece of tofu placed on a plate for you to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not called work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are doing a real work, then even if a young person flies to the sky, we will follow him there to adapt to him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many say that students today are too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if you really know the students' situation, you will know that with the young people, being busy is not a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, the real issue is their interest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If they are interested in something, no matter how busy they are, they will have time for it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They will find time for the things they are interested in even if they are busy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the apostles' time, the Roman Empire persecuted Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Roman Caesar, the emperor, killed many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the apostles were very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They were able to work to such an extent that even some who were in Caesar's household were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Philippians 4:22 says, "All the saints greet you, and especially those of Caesar's household."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This proves that the apostles worked even into Caesar's home.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we must remember that in doing the Lord's work we must not be rigid.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not say that we can eat only tofu and not stones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A competent worker can eat not only tofu but also stones, and he can eat something even as hard as diamonds.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers and sisters, please believe me; learn to adapt to others.</S>
