   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Continually Guarding Against Having "Excess"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fifth, we must uphold and maintain the practice of "He who gathered much had no excess" 2 Cor 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After we have handed over our all, we will gain new possessions gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not expect to gather much when we sow; we simply let go when we sow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, it is a fact that we will gather much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What then should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second Corinthians 8 and 9 come after Acts 2 and 4, not before.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 2 Corinthians, we find the words He who gathered much had no excess.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not a question of whether a man has sold his all, but a question of what a man does after he has sold his all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to empty ourselves of everything at least once, but as new income is received, we have to empty again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As God blesses us and increases our income, we surely have to pour out more.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who sow abundantly should not be in excess.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more absolutely a person deals with the matter of mammon, the faster his money will come back to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A brother once remarked, "We can never beat God in His work."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's emphasis is on "he who gathered much had no excess;" His emphasis is not on "he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap" 2 Cor 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not a matter of reaping with blessing, but a matter of not having excess.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No matter how much income we receive, God wants us to maintain the practice of not having excess.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must deal with money in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before the Lord, we must continually give away our money.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The five points above concern a Christian's attitude towards money, as seen in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is our way of dealing with mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to deal with mammon in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today a Christian should begin his pathway of revival from his experience of deliverance from mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to be delivered from mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>HOW TO MANAGE THE OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the future, we have to learn from God's Word how we should handle our finances and how our private money should be separated from the work's money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have a few guidelines concerning this for our co-workers when they set out for their work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, we should give to the brothers who are in want or to poor people in general.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second, we should care for the needs of individual brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who are making the offering can write down the name of a certain brother on an envelope and drop it in the offering box in care of the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Third, we should care for the need of our own church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fourth, we should care for the need of other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Fifth, we should support the need of the work within our own region.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Churches are local, while the work is regional.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A few places combined together form a region.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the New Testament we find two regions of work Jerusalem and Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The twelve apostles had Jerusalem as their center.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul and the other apostles had Antioch as their center.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul said that they boasted according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure had apportioned to them 2 Cor 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For years we were clear about the locality being the sphere of a local church, but we were not clear about the work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now finally we are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are regions of work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The work in Samaria was under Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The work in Pamphylia was under Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This shows us clearly that there are regions of work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If there is not a clear distinction between the local church and the work, we will be confused as soon as there are some kind of shake-ups.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to remember that the church is confined to a locality, while the work extends to a region.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Elders are appointed for the care of the local churches, while apostles are raised up for the work of a region.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Bible is very clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is only man who is not clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sixth, we should also take care of the need of other regions of work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A normal relationship should exist between various regions of work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jerusalem and Antioch were not cut off one from the other.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A relationship and a fellowship existed between them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Antioch was raised up by Barnabas, who came from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Barnabas went from Jerusalem to Antioch and brought Paul to Jerusalem from Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When Jerusalem was short of money, Antioch sent relief.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Acts we find a close relationship between these two regions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They fellowshipped not only in spiritual matters but in material needs as well.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Presently, we have two regions of work in China Foochow and Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After the eighth month of the Chinese calendar we hope to start the work in Tsingtao or Tientsin as well, linking Tsingtao with Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Following this we will move on to Kwangtung and Kwangsi through Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>During the past few days, P'ing Yang in southern Chekiang as well as Swatow in Kwangtung have both had a start.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are twenty-six to twenty-seven counties around Swatow with brothers and sisters speaking the Hakka dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, the work among the Hakka people must be centered around Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The work is regional.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The failure in our work in the past was in making the work local.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to consider our work from the perspective of the whole region.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The workers have to bear more responsibility in such regions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brother Witness Lee is bearing the responsibility of the work in Shanghai, and Brother Chen Ke-san is bearing the responsibility of the work in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These are six different ways to handle our personal finances.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some people think that we are centralizing the management of finances and that we are turning over our money to the control of one person.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We never have had such a thought in our mind.</S>
