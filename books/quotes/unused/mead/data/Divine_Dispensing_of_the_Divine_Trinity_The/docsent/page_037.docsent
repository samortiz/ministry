   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHILDREN OF GOD BROUGHT FORTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Out of such a Christ ministered, the children of God have been brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The issue of Christ ministered is that many have been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To Have Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These children first of all have the eternal life John 3:15, 16, 36; 1 John 1:2; 5:12-13, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To have the eternal life simply means to have some living dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because you have the eternal life, it flows within you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This flowing within you is just the dispensing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To Partake of the Fellowship of the Eternal Life by Abiding in the Lord and</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Walking in the Light</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are partakers of the fellowship of the eternal life by abiding in the Lord and walking in the light 1 John 1:3-7; 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fellowship is just the flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a life that flows between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even between the members of His Body there is such a flow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This flow reaches all of us and even God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So this is a kind of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Electricity is a good illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Within the lamps in a house and within the power plant itself there is the flow of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That flow is the fellowship between all the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The current brings every lamp into the fellowship with the plant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The power plant may be far away from the lamps in the house, but in the current of the electricity, the power plant and the lamps are in one fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Within us there is a flow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That flow is the eternal life, and that is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all are partaking of such a fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To partake of such a fellowship may not be so substantial as partaking of the divine nature which Peter mentions 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But this fellowship is more enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, there are two ways to eat chicken: one is to eat the solid chicken, and the other is to eat soup made of chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When you are weak or sick, chicken soup is better than chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may use the chicken to illustrate the divine nature, and chicken soup to illustrate the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Which do you prefer?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are a strong person you may like solid chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is good, but it is more tasteful to eat the chicken soup.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Don t forget, the chicken soup comes from chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without a solid chicken, you could not have chicken soup.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, without the divine nature, you could not have the fellowship of the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The divine nature is the solid thing, the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And the fellowship of the divine life is the fellowship of this substance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is for the life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The way to partake of the fellowship of the eternal life is to abide in the Lord and walk in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To Be Taught by the Divine Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you enjoy the fellowship of the eternal life by abiding in the Lord and walking in the light, you are under the teaching of the divine anointing 1 John 2:20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The children of God are also brought forth to be taught by the divine anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The anointing may be considered as a kind of oiling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many machines need to be oiled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If they are not oiled, they do not run smoothly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead they make a lot of noise.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes we Christians make a lot of noise, either to our wife, or to our husband, or to the elders, or to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means we are short of anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to get oiled.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have a source of oil because the anointing is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the time it anoints us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This again is life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This anointing teaches us, oils us, and regulates us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are not regulated by the teaching of the anointing, we are not smooth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The holy anointment oils us, teaches us, and makes us so smooth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To Enjoy the Virtues of the Divine Birth</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>with the Divine Seed</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all have been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We were born not just by our parents but also by God with a divine seed 1 John 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This divine seed is just God s eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There are virtues coming out of this birth and out of this seed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By the virtues of this birth and seed we can practice the divine righteousness 1 John 2:29 , we can practice the divine love 1 John 4:7; 5:1 , and we can overcome the world, death, sin, the Devil, and idols 1 John 5:4, 16-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can overcome everything because we have the virtues of the divine birth with the divine seed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the spiritual language, virtue means life energy and even life energizing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Within us there is a kind of energy that energizes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This energizing is of the divine life, and the divine life comes from the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>So the life energy, the life energizing, is a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We can overcome the negative things because we have the energizing life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This energizing is just the dispensing of life.</S>
