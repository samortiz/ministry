   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is the meaning of two denarii?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the metals in the Bible have their meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Gold in the Bible signifies God's nature, life, glory, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brass in the Bible signifies God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the places in the Bible that require judgment have brass.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The altar was brass, the laver was brass, and the brass serpent was brass.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord's feet were as shining brass; they are for trampling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible iron signifies political authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But silver throughout the Bible signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every time redemption is mentioned, silver is there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Old Testament, the money paid for redemption was silver.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The two denarii here signify the price of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The two denarii were handed to the innkeeper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of this, God has accepted all those that trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Spiritually speaking, the inn signifies God's heavenly house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Physically speaking, it signifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Whatever you spend in addition to this, when I return, I will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we are saved, we are in the church, waiting for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These points are not my main subject, but I mention them in passing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The lawyer asked the Lord, "Who is my neighbor?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the Lord told him this story, He replied to the lawyer with a question, "Which of these three, does it seem to you, has become a neighbor to him who fell into the hands of the robbers?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you listen carefully to this word, you will realize that the Lord is telling the lawyer that he was the one who fell into the hands of the robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many today apply this passage incorrectly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They think that the Lord Jesus wants us to love our neighbor as ourself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether it is the Bible schools, the Sunday schools, or the Sunday pulpits, they all tell people that one has to be a good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You have to love your neighbors, to show mercy to them, and to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To them, who is the neighbor?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the one who was wounded by the robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And who are we?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But this is exactly the opposite of what the Lord Jesus was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What the Lord meant was that we are the ones wounded by the robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who then is our neighbor?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our neighbor is the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We think that we are the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can move.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can walk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we see those bound by sin, we are able to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the Lord Jesus said that we are not the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we need the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are the man wounded by robbers on the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are those who are waiting to die.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not have any good works.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Who is our neighbor?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is it to love our neighbor as ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It does not say that we have to love others as ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It means that we have to love the Savior as ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It does not mean that we must first love others before we can inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, it means that if we love the Savior, the Samaritan, we will surely have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The problem today is that man continually thinks of works.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When he reads Luke 10, he says to himself: "Someone is wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Someone is dying.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If I care for him and love him, I will be a good Samaritan, and I will have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We think that when we help others, we will inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the Lord Jesus said if you allow someone to help you, you will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>None among us is qualified to be the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thank the Lord, we do not have to be the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have a good Samaritan already.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This Samaritan, who formerly had no dealings with us, has now come.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He has died and has solved the problem of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is now resurrected, and He has given us a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This One has bound up our wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He has given us redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is helping us and is bringing us to heaven, that God would accept us and care for us.</S>
