   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Condition of Entering</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>into the Kingdom of the Heavens 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not Merely Calling On the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>but Doing the Will of the Heavenly Father</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 21 says, Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father Who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This does not refer to the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today, but to the coming manifestation of the kingdom in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To enter into the kingdom of the heavens we need to do two things: call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To call on the Lord suffices for us to be saved Rom 10:13 , but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens we also need to do the will of the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, Not everyone who says...Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but those who call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since entering into the kingdom of the heavens also requires doing the will of the heavenly Father, it is clearly different from entering into the kingdom of God by being regenerated John 3:3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This latter is by the birth of the divine life; the former is by the living of that life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 21 the Lord does not say your Father, but My Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here the Lord seems to be saying, I, the Son of Man and the Son of God, have been doing the will of My Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You also are sons of God and My brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, you must be My companions and take the same way that I take.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now you are not to do the will of your Father, but the will of My Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You are My brothers, My companions, and My partners.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You and I are walking the same way and doing the same will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You are living with Me according to the will of My Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this last section of the constitution, it is no longer a negative matter of dealing with our temper, lust, self, flesh, and anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is absolutely a positive matter of doing the will of the Father who is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The kingdom people are not for anything other than doing the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not here merely to overcome our temper, our lusts, our self, and our flesh, and to be kind and sympathetic to others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are here for the accomplishment of the will of the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to do the will of the Father, we need to walk in the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the teachings of the worldly philosophers, there is neither the divine life and divine nature nor the divine way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But here the ultimate issue of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is the will of the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that we have a heavenly Father and that we are the Father s sons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, in the last section of the constitution it is not only a matter of life, but also a matter of the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our Father has a will to accomplish, but we can accomplish it only by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to live in the life of the heavenly Father and also by that life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of living is for the doing of the Father s will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens we cannot see what the will of the Father actually is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, it is clearly revealed in chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Father s will is to build the church upon the Son as the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is fully developed in the Acts, the Epistles, and the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The New Testament reveals that God s divine, eternal will is to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many Prophesying, Casting Out Demons, and Doing Many Works of Power in the Lord s Name, but Not According to the Heavenly Father s Will</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 22 says, Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The words that day refer to the day of the judgment seat of Christ 1 Cor 3:13, 4:5; 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the day of judgment, when all the believers will stand before the judgment seat of Christ, many will say to the Lord that they prophesied, cast out demons, and did works of power in His name, but they will be rejected by the Lord.</S>
