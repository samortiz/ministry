<h2 class="head2">The Four Persons in the Promise</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Serpent</h2>
<p>Four persons are spoken of in the promise in Genesis 3:15. The first person in this verse, <em>you,</em> refers to Satan. Although God was talking to the serpent, Satan was in the serpent. The serpent was the incarnation of Satan. Hence, the serpent was Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Woman</h2>
<p>The second person in this verse, <em>the woman,</em> refers to a woman who has several layers of meaning. It is very clear that the woman refers to Eve. However, if we consider the entire Bible, we will realize that this woman refers to much more than just Eve. Some people say that this woman refers to Mary because the Lord Jesus was the seed of a woman and because He bruised the serpent&rsquo;s head on the cross. Hence, they say that this woman must refer also to Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus. Even though we acknowledge that this woman refers to Mary, &ldquo;the woman&rdquo; still refers to much more. This woman is a great, mysterious woman.</p>
<p>This woman includes not only Eve and Mary, because all those who have been created by God and who are of God are included in this woman. The Bible reveals that God is the unique man in the universe. He is the only man in the universe. Everyone who has been created by God and is of God, that is, all those who are redeemed by God, are the woman. This is the reason that the Old Testament refers to the children of Israel as the wife of God (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:1; Hosea 2:19). They were a woman before God. Furthermore, the New Testament speaks of all the saved ones being a virgin betrothed to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2). In the future the church, a composition of all the saved ones, will be the New Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb (Rev. 21:9).</p>
<p>These examples show that God&rsquo;s created and redeemed ones are in the position of a woman. Simply speaking, this woman is the aggregate of God&rsquo;s redeemed ones throughout the ages. Therefore, <em>I will put enmity between you and the woman</em> means that there will be enmity between Satan and God&rsquo;s redeemed ones. This matter is proved by history. History reveals that Satan is at enmity with whoever turns to God and receives God&rsquo;s redemption. In the vision in Revelation 12 the serpent is called &ldquo;the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan&rdquo; (v. 9). This is the serpent in Genesis 3. This ancient serpent stood before a woman (Rev. 12:4), being at enmity with her and opposing her as her adversary.</p>
<p>The woman in Revelation 12 is the woman in Genesis 3. The promise in Genesis is not fulfilled before Revelation 12. Therefore, the woman in Genesis 3 is the woman manifested in Revelation 12. This woman is not an individual woman; rather, she is a universal woman because she is clothed with the sun, the moon is underneath her feet, and a crown of twelve stars is on her head (v. 1). This woman is a great, universal woman. Everything about her is heavenly. The sun, the moon, and the twelve stars are all heavenly. Moreover, they are light-bearers; they are bright, without any darkness. This woman is extraordinary; the light-bearers in the universe are with her and are related to her.</p>
<p>To whom does this universal woman refer? There are only two places in the Bible that mention the sun, the moon, and twelve stars together. One place is Revelation 12, and the other is Genesis 37. We must use Genesis 37 to interpret the sun, the moon, and the twelve stars in Revelation 12. According to Genesis 37:9, Joseph had a dream about the sun, the moon, and eleven stars. These light-bearers represent the entire household of Israel that had been redeemed by God. From the context we can clearly see that the sun refers to Jacob, Joseph&rsquo;s father; the moon refers to Joseph&rsquo;s mother; and eleven of the twelve stars refer to Joseph&rsquo;s brothers. There are twelve stars including Joseph. This was Jacob&rsquo;s entire household. The principle of the sun, the moon, and the twelve stars being together refers to the totality of God&rsquo;s redeemed ones. Hence, this universal woman, who is clothed with the sun, who has the moon underneath her feet, and who has a crown of twelve stars on her head, refers to the totality of God&rsquo;s redeemed ones.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21 the holy city, New Jerusalem, is referred to as a bride adorned for her husband, coming down out of heaven from God (v. 2). This city includes all those who have been saved throughout time. Collectively, these saved persons are a woman before God. This woman is heavenly, not earthly, and she is bright, not dark. Undoubtedly, the woman in chapter 12 is the predecessor of the bride in chapter 21. When the days are fulfilled, the woman in chapter 12 will be manifested as the bride in chapter 21. Hence, the universal woman in chapter 12 refers to the totality of those who have been redeemed by God throughout the ages.</p>
<p>The universal woman in chapter 12 is clothed with light-bearers. The sun is for the day, and the moon and the stars are for the night. According to the Bible, day and night symbolize the age of the New Testament and the age of the Old Testament, respectively. When Christ came to the earth, He was manifested as the rising sun (Luke 1:78). Therefore, the birth of the Lord Jesus was the coming of the day and marked the beginning of the New Testament age. Since the New Testament is the age of the day, the Old Testament should be the age of the night. Hence, the sun with which the woman is clothed refers to all those who are redeemed in the New Testament age. The moon underneath her feet and the twelve stars on her head refer to the redeemed ones in the Old Testament age.</p>
<p>The redeemed ones in the Old Testament are divided into two categories. One category is stars, which are scattered, and the other category is the moon, which is collective. If we consider the Old Testament, we will realize that this is exactly the case. The first period of the Old Testament was the period of the patriarchs, from Abraham to Joseph, who were stars. Twelve is the number of completeness. In the eyes of God, the patriarchs were stars in a dark night, drawing near to God. Therefore, they are in the front and upon the head. After the time of the patriarchs, the nation of Israel was formed. This nation is a collective unit; hence, it is represented by the moon.</p>
<p>The woman in Revelation 12 has the stars on her head and the moon underneath her feet. Putting something on the head is to exalt it, but putting something underneath the feet is to lower it. The patriarchs, represented by the twelve stars, were living in the principle of grace. They were in the Old Testament age, but they lived in the grace of God, taking grace as their principle of living before God. The principle of grace is the highest principle. This is the reason that the patriarchs are exalted as stars. The New Testament age is also altogether in the principle of grace, which is indicated by the sun. Therefore, the woman is clothed with the sun.</p>
<p>The children of Israel became a collective unit from the time that the law was given at Mount Sinai. When the law was given, the children of Israel were no longer under grace but under the law (Exo. 19&mdash;20). The woman in Revelation 12 has the moon underneath her feet, signifying that the law should not be exalted. The twelve stars refer to the first group of redeemed people, the patriarchs, who lived under grace. The sun refers to the redeemed in the New Testament, who constitute the majority of this woman. Based on this light, we can interpret the vision in Revelation 12. The woman in this vision is the woman in God&rsquo;s promise in Genesis 3:15, and Satan is at enmity with her.</p>
