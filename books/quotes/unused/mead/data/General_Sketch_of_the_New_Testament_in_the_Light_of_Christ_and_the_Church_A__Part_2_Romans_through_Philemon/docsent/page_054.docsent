   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Bountiful Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 19 of chapter one is another verse which is very precious yet very much neglected by Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Conybeare tells us that the Greek word for supply is a technical word, referring to the choragus, the leader of the chorus on the Greek stage.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The choragus was responsible to supply all the needs of the members of the chorus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their clothing, food, musical instruments, and everything they needed was provided by the choragus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul used this same word to describe the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, this word may be rendered as bountiful supply, a supply that meets all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The term the Spirit of Jesus Christ is richer than the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit of God at the beginning of the Old Testament was not as rich as the Spirit of Jesus Christ after Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Old Testament times, within the Spirit of Jehovah there were not the elements of the humanity of the Lord Jesus, His suffering in His human life, the effectiveness of His death, and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, on the day of Pentecost the Spirit was poured out from the ascended Christ, and within this Spirit were all these elements.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A cup of plain water contains only the water, but if we add tea, sugar, and other ingredients, the water becomes richer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a picture of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To speak only of the Spirit of God is not sufficient; today the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this Spirit there is divinity, the heavenly element, and there is also humanity, the suffering of the Lord Jesus in His human life on earth, His crucifixion, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit of Jesus Christ may be compared to an allinclusive dose of medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we take this dose, one element kills germs, another element supplies nourishment, and other elements supply other needs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reason that Paul could live Christ and magnify Him, the reason he was able to say, "For to me, to live is Christ," is that he had the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a member of the "chorus," Paul was bountifully supplied by the Choragus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the proper meaning of Philippians 1:19.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also are members of the "chorus," and the Holy Spirit is the choragus to satisfy all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are human beings, and within the Spirit is the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are suffering on the earth, and within Him there is the element of the suffering of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need the cross as our killing element, and within the Spirit there is this element.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We also need His resurrection power, and within the Spirit of Jesus Christ there is this power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever we need today is in the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ we can live Christ to magnify Him, and we can say, "For to me, to live is Christ."</S>
