As servants, the first thing we should touch is the authority of the Master. Those whose eyes are set on men have never touched authority. As ministers of God, being in line with the authority of the Head is the first principle we have to keep. Naturally, we were all under the principle of rebellion. In order to serve God, we have to be confronted by His authority in a definite way. We have to come into His presence and meet His authority face to face. We have to be wounded and defeated by this encounter. We have to be humbled by authority and face it in a genuine way. This experience has to be as real as our experience of salvation. This is the only way for us to be ushered into His service. Before we can participate in His work, we must touch authority in a definite way once. In our relationship with God, one controversy&mdash;whether or not we have touched His authority&mdash;remains. Once we touch authority, we will sense it everywhere. We do not ask others to obey us. Those who know authority will never have a problem with men. When I was in Shanghai someone asked me concerning the matter of submission: "What if God's deputy authority is wrong? What if my inner being cannot respond to the words of a deputy authority?" Those who ask such a question show that they have a fundamental problem. Will a person give up a fish simply because he has found bones in it or give up a bowl of rice simply because he has found a husk in it? Those who ask such questions have their eyes on men, not on authority. We are contending for the reality of the presence of God and an encounter with His authority. This encounter has to produce wounds and brokenness. This is the only way for us to be humbled. Unless there is such an encounter, our problems will never go away, not even if Paul, Peter, Solomon, and David came to our aid.</p><p>A brother in Shanghai once said to me, "Brother Nee, now I see authority. From now on I will obey whatever you say." When I heard this, I said to Brother Lee, "Terrible! He wants to obey me. That is a big mistake." No mistake in this world is greater than this one. Man thinks that obedience is going along with a certain person. If our mind is set on men all the time and if our thoughts are set on obeying men's words all the time, we are on the wrong track. If we constantly expect others to obey us, we are also wrong. If we think this way, we are only touching men; we have not touched authority. I would like to ask a question: "Have we touched the Lord's authority as definitely as we touched Him at the time of our salvation?" If we have not, everything we have is a deception; we are merely acting out our Christian life.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we have to be brought to the point where we can say that there is such a thing in this universe as authority and that we have touched it and have been wounded by it, just as a man is wounded when he hits the wall with his head. If we can say this, we will have the proper feeling the next time we touch authority. We will have the proper judgment within, and we will not be careless in any way. We will know that we are touching authority, not men. If we only touch men, we may obey when these men are around. As soon as they are gone, however, we will assume our throne again. Some people are only afraid of certain brothers and sisters. When these brothers and sisters are not around, they feel free to do anything. However, if a man has truly touched authority, he will not behave this way. Even if the persons he is afraid of are gone, God's authority will still be present. If a man has touched authority in one place, he will touch authority in every place. Authority fills the whole universe. It fills the world as well as the church. The most perfect manifestation of authority is in the church. Once we find authority in the church, we find headship, we find speaking that represents headship, and we find obedience that issues from this headship. If anyone does not obey this headship, he has not seen God's appointed authority.</p><p>The fundamental problem in our service is that we obey men rather than authority. In Foochow there were two brothers who would obey only me but no one else. These brothers had not touched authority. It was equally wrong for them to obey me and for them to not obey others. It is useless for a man to listen to and to obey others if he has never touched God's authority. We are not here to obey men, but to submit to authority. You have been a Christian for many years. Now you are giving yourself to serve the Lord. If you have never touched God's authority, how can you serve Him? Those who know authority sense it wherever it may be. Those who do not know authority are selective in their obedience. Such a selection will not occur with those who know authority. Everyone who knows authority is enlightened before God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
