<h2 class="head1">DESIRING TO BE ANGELS AND TO GO TO HEAVEN<br />
BEING WRONG CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>Many Christians have the thought and desire to be like an angel. Perhaps even some sisters among us would like to be an angel. According to the Bible, the fall of man began when Satan seduced Eve and told her that she could become like God by eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 3:5). In doing so, Satan tempted man to leave his status as a man. Some religions are focused on the thought of pursuing and attaining immortality, but this is not God&rsquo;s desire. Buddhist monks and Taoist priests have all been deceived by Satan in this regard. God wants us to be men who express Him; He has no desire that we become like Buddhist monks, Taoist priests, or Catholic priests and nuns. God needs normal men.</p>
<p>Christianity also promotes the concept of going to heaven. This is a wrong concept. Many Christians believe that they will go to heaven when they die, but Satan is not afraid of men who think only of going to heaven. Satan is afraid of men who will be men of God on earth. While man dreams of going to heaven, God longs to come to the earth. Man hopes for heaven, but God&rsquo;s hopes are related to the earth. God is very interested in the earth, and He wants to gain the earth. When the Lord Jesus taught people to pray to the Father, He said, &ldquo;Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo; (Matt. 6:10). Many Christians have no desire to be on this earth with its sufferings. A person may have no regard for his parents, be dissatisfied with his wife, disappointed in his sons, and displeased with his daughters. Hence, when he looks at his situation and considers his misery on earth, he longs to go to heaven as a means of escape. But this longing, however, goes against the Lord&rsquo;s word: &ldquo;Your will be done...on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some have accused me of speaking heresy because I tell people that the New Jerusalem is not heaven or a place of heavenly mansions. When I say this, their concept of heaven is nullified. However, this is the word of the Bible; it is not a heresy. Revelation 21:2 says, &ldquo;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&rdquo; Man wants to go to heaven, but God wants to come down to the earth. We do not need to be angels or to dream of going to heaven.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD NEEDING MAN</h2>
<p>God does not need angels; He needs man. He not only needed man in order to accomplish redemption; He also needs man for the preaching of the gospel. God does not want angels to preach the gospel. When Cornelius was praying in Acts 10, an angel came and said to him, &ldquo;Send for a certain Simon, who is surnamed Peter&rdquo; (v. 5). If I were Cornelius, I would have asked the angel to preach the gospel to me directly. I would have seen no need to send for Peter. If I had spoken to the angel in this way, however, the angel would have said, &ldquo;I am sorry, but I am not a man. I am not qualified to preach the gospel; I can only relay messages. Peter is qualified to preach the gospel.&rdquo; This shows that an angel is not higher than a man. Would you rather be an angel or a man? I am almost seventy years old, but I do not feel that I have had sufficient time on the earth as a man. I have no desire to go to heaven; I would like to be on the earth as a man, expressing God and doing God&rsquo;s will, until the Lord Jesus comes again. Those who feel that being a man involves only a bland existence lack Jesus. When we experience Christ in us, however, nothing is bland; even our sufferings become full of meaning.</p>
<p>The Bible contains only the revelation of God, but Christianity contains many concepts that are based only on the traditions of men. Women often want to be nuns because they do not want to deal with the difficulties of a husband or the encumbrance of children. This allows them to be an &ldquo;angel,&rdquo; according to their concept. This is in contrast to the thought of God, who said, &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it&rdquo; (Gen. 1:28).</p>
<p>We should ask ourselves whether we truly have a desire to be a man, because the true value of a man lies in our enjoyment of the Lord Jesus. Jesus is a man. Even though Jesus, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit, He still is a man with humanity. His humanity and His person are in this Spirit. The Lord Jesus was not only a man on the earth; He is still a man in heaven, and He will be a man throughout eternity. In John 1:51 the Lord said to Nathanael, &ldquo;You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo; Acts 7 records that when Stephen was being martyred, he saw the Lord as the Son of Man in heaven (v. 56). In eternity our Lord Jesus will still be the Son of Man. This is mysterious, and its depths cannot be exhausted in words.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is real and living. He possesses humanity in addition to divinity, and He dealt with Satan in His humanity. In His humanity He became our Savior and the dwelling place of God. Furthermore, His humanity has become our food. We need to eat Him, drink Him, and take Him into us so that His humanity becomes our humanity! The more a man has the Lord Jesus as his humanity, the more he appreciates his status as a man, especially as a man in relation to his parents, his wife, and his children. The more he lives as a man, the more he appreciates the meaning of being a man and the more he is a man. The more he is filled with the Lord Jesus, the more he experiences the reality of being a man because this second man is complete and perfect. This is possible because His humanity becomes our humanity.</p>
