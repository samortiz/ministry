   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR CHRIST AS GOD AND MAN SUPERIOR TO THE ANGELS Scripture Reading: Heb 1 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these messages we will continue to see a general sketch of the New Testament in the light of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have already pointed out, the entire New Testament reveals a universal man, which is composed of Christ as the Head and the church as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Testament can be divided into three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first section is composed of the first five books, from Matthew through Acts, showing us the history of this universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second section comprises the twenty-one Epistles from Romans through Jude, giving us a full definition and explanation of this universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The last section is the book of Revelation, which shows us the ultimate consummation of this universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the entire New Testament deals with the universal man and the history, definition, and consummation of this man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE EIGHT SUPPLEMENTARY EPISTLES</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first part of the second section includes the books from Romans through Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These thirteen Epistles give us a full definition, a full picture, of the Body of this universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then, the other eight Epistles, from Hebrews through Jude, serve as a supplement to this definition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These last eight Epistles comprise five items of supplement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first item of the supplement is the book of Hebrews, which is an explanation of the difference between Christ and Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The thirteen Epistles from Romans through Philemon do not address the problem of Judaism and the difference between Christ and Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, a supplementary book is needed to clarify this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second book, James, is a supplement dealing with the relationship between works and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first thirteen Epistles stress the matter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They do not give us a clear understanding about the relationship of works and faith, so again there is the need of a supplement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First and 2 Peter, as the third item of the supplement, deal with the government of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Again, the first thirteen Epistles do not touch the matter of the divine government of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today in this universe there is the divine government of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must keep all the rules of this divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we violate any one of them, we will suffer something.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fourth item of the supplement, the Epistles of John, deals with the fellowship in God's divine family.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The last item, Jude, deals with apostasy, the drifting away of the church from the right track of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CHRIST BEING SUPERIOR TO ALL THE ITEMS OF JUDAISM</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hebrews, as the first item of the supplement, is a rich and high book dealing with the matter of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have conducted a study of this book on at least three main occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have spent many years in it, and I have found that it is a rich yet difficult book.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not easy for its readers to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Judaism Being Composed of Five Wonderful Items</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before Christ was incarnated as a man, God gave the people of Israel a number of items, all comprising Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Judaism, the Jewish religion, there is first of all God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second there are the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Following these there are the leaders such as Moses and Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fourth, there is the priesthood with the priests, such as Aaron and his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The last item is the old covenant, including all the sacrifices, the offerings, the tabernacle, and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Judaism is composed with these five items God, the angels, the leaders, the priests, and the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you take away these five items, Judaism will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is so good, and the angels are wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We highly esteem Moses, Joshua, Aaron, and his sons the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We also consider the old covenant as something marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Altogether, Judaism is very good, even wonderful, because in it we have God, the angels, the leaders, the priests, and the old covenant.</S>
