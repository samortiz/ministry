   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE ENCOURAGEMENT AND INSTRUCTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THOSE PARTICIPATING IN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE GOSPEL EVANGELIZATION WORK</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This meeting is mainly for those who are participating in the evangelization work in the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those trainees who are presently in the training are also invited to attend, because in the future, they will also be taking the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although I do not have an outline for you, I do have a definite burden to fellowship with you in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>NO CONCEPT OF TITLE, RANK, OR POSITION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The full course of our training is two years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first year is for training here in the training center.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second year is for practice in the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first thing I want you to know clearly is that among us, there is no title, rank, or position.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, the Bible tells us that through the grace received, some have the function of apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the other hand, the Bible also shows us that we are all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If anyone desires to be great, he has to be the servant of all Matt 20:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This word annuls all concepts of title, rank, and position in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, there must never be any hierarchical concept with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some may consider me to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But who can tell?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even I myself cannot tell this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But I do know of the Lord's commission to me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I cannot deny what I can do and that I have a portion that others cannot replace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Among us during the past two or three years, there were some problems.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether others exalt me or attack me, I have not been affected because I have been following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I will never do anything divisive, and I will never oppose anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when it comes to the matter of the truth, I never give in. I will always stand for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every one of us as a saved one has our capacity, that is, our function or our gift, in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet we do not have titles, ranks, or positions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is true that in the church there are elders, and that the younger ones should submit to the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However. this should not be a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, it should be a matter of function.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For many years, I have felt uneasy about using the term co-workers for fear that this matter would develop into a special rank among us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If anyone has this concept, I would beg you to drop it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Body of Christ there are different members.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are the big members and the small members, the high members and the low members.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, this is not a matter of position but a matter of function.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, the two eyebrows are higher than the two eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The difference in location is due to their difference in function.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Bible, everyone who belongs to the Lord is a member in the Body of the Lord and should therefore be a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the members should do the same work of building up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason, we should not consider the term co-worker as a special title.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, it is all right to call someone a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>EXPERIENCING SPIRITUAL WARFARE AND</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>LEARNING SPIRITUAL LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>While I was away, I often received letters from you, and I have heard some news concerning you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to my understanding, your evangelization work in the villages during the past year or so has not been without spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In some places, you fast twice a week to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is surely right.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, in the experience of life you have definitely learned more spiritual lessons than you would have learned by being in a big church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But I would still say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The most precious thing in the church is the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With oneness there is the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Opinions will only bring in problems.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You should not consider quitting the training as a solution, because this would betray your initial consecration of living to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You should take up the cross and accept all difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Wipe away all tears and follow the Lord to go on.</S>
