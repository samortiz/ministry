   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without the overcomers the Body of Christ cannot be built up, and unless the Body of Christ is built up, Christ cannot come back for His bride.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The building up of the Body of Christ is by the overcomers produced by God in the intensified work of His organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The building up of the Body of Christ by the overcomers in this age is for the initial consummation of the New Jerusalem in the kingdom age and eventually for the full consummation of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But nearly two thousand years have passed, and the bride still has not been prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The overcomers produced by Christ s intensified work will build up the Body of Christ, which will become the bride of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the end of this age Antichrist and his false prophet will rise up to be the top enemies of Christ in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who will defeat them?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These enemies will be defeated by Christ s bridal army, formed with the overcomers.</S>

The consummated Spirit as the second Paraclete the Comforter , the realization of Christ as the first Paraclete, takes care of the believers, especially in the matter of the Divine Trinity being the main, life element of the organic salvation of God John 14:16-18 .</S>
