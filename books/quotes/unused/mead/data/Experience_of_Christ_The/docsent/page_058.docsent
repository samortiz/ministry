   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAW AND CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible teaches us the law in a negative sense and Christ in a positive sense.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we do not know the law negatively and Christ positively, we do not know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Religious people care for the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anyone who does not have the revelation and the vision of the excellency of Christ will become involved with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When people are indifferent toward God, they may not care about morality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But once they begin to care for Him, they will also care for morality and try to live a good life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Immediately, they will become involved with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When people are careless, they do not care for God, for morality, or for their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They care only for their pleasure, doing whatever pleases them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, they are lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if such a person turns, repents, and cares for God, he will also care for morality and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way he will come under the law and make up his mind to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He will study the Bible to learn how to please God and to benefit others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, he will study the Bible to find out about the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He will also be eager to receive instruction from those who can teach him to improve his behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This kind of religion helps society and the government, for the government certainly desires to have good citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, a religion that teaches people to behave, to be good, and to be peaceful will be welcomed by society.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians today care more for the law than for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even learning to pray, to be holy, and to speak in tounges may be matters of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The same is true regarding instruction in being a good wife or husband.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the human mentality there is nothing but the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no room, capacity, or ground for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Very few people ever ask me how they can experience Christ in order to be a good husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It seems that Christians never relate Christ to being a good wife or husband.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most seem to leave Christ far away in the heavens and devote their attention to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the Judaizers, including Saul of Tarsus, were for the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They seemed to say, "We Hebrews have the law of God, but the Gentile dogs do not have it."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The law was the unique heritage of the Jews, and they gloried and boasted in it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord Jesus came, He offended the Judaizers because He changed the dispensation of the law to the dispensation of Christ, or of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Judaizers seemed to say, "Are you trying to get rid of our law?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are for the law, and we shall rise up against You.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, we shall persecute anyone who follows You.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the righteousness of the law, we are blameless."</S>
