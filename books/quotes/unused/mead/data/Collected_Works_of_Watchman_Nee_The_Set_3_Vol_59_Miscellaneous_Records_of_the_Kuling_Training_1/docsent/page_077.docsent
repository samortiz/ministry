   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING DELIVERED FROM REASON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is another lesson which we have to learn: All those who reason with God are actually not reasoning with Him, but rebelling against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means they are rebelling and offending God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The law of gravity operates in such a way that the lower an object is, the steadier it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who remain in a low position before God have the greatest stability.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more a man lays low and the more he prostrates himself in the dust, the more rest he has.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who stand on a table are more liable to fall down, but those who have fallen will not fall further.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A man who has fallen needs someone to lift him up before he can walk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once a man sees God's authority, all reasons go away.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more reasons a man has, the less experience he has of God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Numbers 16 shows us another rebellion among the people of Israel after the rebellion of Korah's company with the two hundred fifty leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The people accused Moses of killing God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This rebellion was a rebellion of the entire congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even though the earth opened its mouth and swallowed Korah's company and the two hundred fifty men, the people were still blind to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were reasoning even more than before.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Finally, God was forced to judge them and punish them with the plague.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Reasons come before rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The root of rebellion is our reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to be delivered from rebellion, God must first deliver us from reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>OVERTHROWING THE STRONGHOLD OF REASON</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second Corinthians 10:4-5 tells us that reasoning is a kind of stronghold.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to obey Christ, a man must take captive his every thought and overthrow the stronghold of reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 5 says, "As we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every high thing refers to everything that hinders a man from the knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The greatest of these things is reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once a man reasons with God, this reasoning becomes a high thing in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul said that these strongholds must be overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are erected by Satan, and they are related to reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a man is not subject to Christ, he is bound by these strongholds.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A man is able to obey Christ only by overthrowing these strongholds and taking captive these thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Reasonings are strongholds erected by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As soon as a man reasons, his thoughts are taken captive; they become bound by his reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Word of God tells us how strongly reasonings influence man's whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not regard reasonings as a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once reasonings come in, thoughts become rebellious, and words and actions follow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we can overthrow our reasons, our thoughts will spontaneously obey the Lord, and all problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan tries to imprison man with thoughts and reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our thoughts are rebellious because they have been carried away by our reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more reasons we have, the less we can overcome our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everything that Satan does is backed up by reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He does not speak in vain; he erects strongholds within a man's thoughts and garrisons them so that the man cannot run away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not think that we are free when we reason within ourselves in our own room.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to realize that we are a prisoner, chained and locked inside iron gates and walls.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no way for us to free ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no way for us to obey Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can call 2 Corinthians 10 the "Jessie Penn-Lewis chapter."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one can match her clarity of understanding about the freedom of a Christian's mental state.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether or not Christ's authority is in control depends on how a man thinks and how free his thoughts are, and how free a man's thoughts are depends on how much he is delivered from reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul said that in order to overthrow the mental strongholds, a man must be powerful before God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He must overthrow reasonings with spiritual weapons so that his thoughts may be captured back to the obedience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In reading 2 Corinthians 10, we are easily reminded of the story of Eve's rebellion against God in Genesis 3, which can be considered as a footnote to 2 Corinthians 10.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Satan did not persuade Eve to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He merely reasoned with Eve and stirred her up to think.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She looked and saw that the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was pleasing to the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She thought that the fruit was good for food and that the fruit would open her eyes and give her discernment between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There were wonderful reasons behind her action.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Satan stirred up her thoughts by asking one question.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As a result, Eve began to reason, and the end of this reasoning was her eating of the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Action comes after reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After Eve reasoned with herself, she decided to ignore God's command.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She thought that she could eat the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She ignored God's word and allowed reasoning to come in. Please remember that reasoning has no place in the pathway of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The pathway of obedience does not have any trace of reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the world no one will do anything without a reason, but in the spiritual realm, the more reasons and thoughts a person has, the less likely he will obey.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For a Christian, reasons are Satan's strongholds.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They close up a man's thoughts and rob him of his freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As soon as a man reasons, his thoughts are taken hostage.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Man's reasons are always joined to his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As soon as thoughts are taken hostage, a man cannot obey Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we want to be a free man and want to obey Christ, we have to overthrow the reasons in the mind with our spiritual weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>THE NEED TO TOUCH AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The obedience we are speaking of today is different from the obedience that men spoke of in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are saying that a man must first touch authority before he submits.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is a big difference between submission that comes after one encounters authority and submission that comes without any encounter with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After a man recognizes God's authority, his obedience will have a different flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>His previous obedience was lower in quality.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The new obedience is much higher in quality.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only one who has touched God's authority will possess genuine submission and know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Everything depends on whether or not a man has touched God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once this matter is settled, all other problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Once this issue is dealt with, all revilings will stop, and all reasoning will cease.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If the Lord reveals Himself to us today, we will behave differently when we walk into the kitchen tomorrow; we will act obediently according the cook's order.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we come together, we will not need to form a committee to discuss the order of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our reasonings and thoughts will be captured, and we will do nothing but look for those to whom we should submit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Those who are under authority obey the Lord's commands; their eyes are not set on how others behave.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Instead, they identify the authority that rests in others and obey accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In no other passage of the Bible do we find God speaking to His children like He does in Romans 9.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This chapter shows us that God never reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In other places we find examples of reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Romans 6, 7, and 8 all have fine reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God has a basis for doing things, but Romans 9 tells us that God's selection is based on His will, His calling, His choice, and His sovereignty; no reasons need be given.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Here we touch God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He is the Lord high above, and we should prostrate ourselves before His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>True worship comes not only from the cross but from a knowledge of God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When we see that He is high above, we will realize how small we are.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This contrast will invoke us to genuine worship.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We do not have to know whether God's actions are good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We only need to know that God has done it and be satisfied with it.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Once we see that the Lord occupies the highest place, we will render Him the greatest worship.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Once we know God's glory and authority, our reasonings and rebellious thoughts will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>May the Lord have mercy on us so that the eyes of our understanding would not be blinded by Satan through our reasonings and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>May we not take the way of the recovery in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>May the Lord deliver us from all reasons, all spirits of rebellion, and all defiant thoughts.</S>
