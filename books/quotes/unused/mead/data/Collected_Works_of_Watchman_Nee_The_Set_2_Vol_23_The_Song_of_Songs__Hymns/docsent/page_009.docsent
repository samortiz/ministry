   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She is swift because of her natural strength and gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the revelation of the chambers has resulted in a spiritual pursuit on her part, her natural swiftness, that is, her natural strength and gentleness, is still at work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps the reason for the lack of advance in many people is their natural swiftness!</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a ring, a crown of golden borders.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"The King sitteth at his table."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This refers to the believers' enjoyment of the Lord's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These riches can be divided into two categories: 1 the flour and the meal, which signify the Lord Jesus' life and the Lord Himself, and 2 the meats, which refer to His work and His death.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have not seen that God's accepted sacrifice is our enjoyment, we will not have consecration and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when we see that we enjoy the same thing that God enjoys, the ointment of spikenard will spontaneously flow out.</S>
