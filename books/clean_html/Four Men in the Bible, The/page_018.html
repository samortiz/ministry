<h2 class="head1">FOUR UNIQUE SYMBOLS<br />
RELATED TO OUR EXPERIENCE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>There are four verses in the Bible that contain four unique symbols of the Spirit, all of which are related to our experience of the Spirit. The first symbol is water. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; We have all been given to drink of the Spirit. The Spirit is water to us, and we need to drink Him. Hence, water is the first symbol that speaks of our realization of the Spirit in our experience. The second symbol is ointment, the anointing oil. Second Corinthians 1:21 and 22 speak of our being firmly attached unto Christ and being anointed. The word <em>anointed</em> indicates that the Spirit is like ointment, the anointing oil, and that God has anointed us with the Spirit, having sealed us and having given us the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts. Verse 22, which says, &ldquo;He who has also sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge,&rdquo; also points to the third and fourth symbols, which are the Spirit as a seal and as a pledge. God has sealed us with the Spirit. The Spirit is not only like ointment but also like a seal. The Chinese usually have a seal that represents who they are as a person. Similarly, God has a seal, which is the Spirit, and He sealed us with His Spirit. The fourth symbol, the pledge, is also spoken of in verse 5 of chapter 5. This verse says, &ldquo;Now He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the Spirit as a pledge.&rdquo; A pledge is a security, a guarantee. The Spirit is in us as a guarantee that God is our portion. Therefore, the Spirit we have received is like water, ointment, a seal, and a pledge.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING ATTACHED US WITH THE ANOINTED ONE</h2>
<p>Verse 21 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.&rdquo; This refers to the attaching of the apostles with the believers unto Christ, the anointed One. The word <em>Christ</em> in Greek has the same meaning as <em>Messiah</em> in Hebrew. In John 1:41 Andrew found his brother Simon and said to him, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah (which translated means Christ).&rdquo; <em>Messiah</em> in Hebrew is translated as &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; in Greek, and it means &ldquo;the anointed,&rdquo; the One appointed by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose, God&rsquo;s eternal plan. Hence, both <em>Messiah</em> and <em>Christ</em> mean &ldquo;the anointed.&rdquo; The anointed One is the Lord Jesus whom God has anointed with the Spirit. In Luke 4:18 the Lord said, &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus is God&rsquo;s Anointed. God has poured out His Spirit upon the Lord, anointing Him with the Spirit; therefore, the Lord Jesus is the Anointed.</p>
<p>God has firmly attached the apostles with the believers unto Christ, the anointed One. God&rsquo;s anointing oil is altogether on Him, and this anointing oil has further been poured out upon the apostles and the believers. God&rsquo;s anointing oil has been poured out on Christ, and He has firmly attached the believers to Christ so that the anointing oil on Him now flows onto us.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:27 says, &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; This verse can also be translated, &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into the anointed One have put on the anointed One.&rdquo; God has baptized us into Christ, which equals baptizing us into the anointed One. Consequently, we have put on the anointed One. God has firmly attached the apostles with the believers unto the anointed One; thus, all the anointing oil on Him flows onto the apostles and the believers.</p>
<p>Although the Bible says that we have been firmly attached to the anointed One, it often does not seem as if there is any anointing oil upon us. At such times, it is easy to have little or no faith. Nevertheless, the Bible says that those who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. Consequently, those who have been baptized into the anointed One have put on the anointed One. God has firmly attached us to the anointed One; therefore, God&rsquo;s anointing is our portion. This is clearly experiential.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE RICHES OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Breathing the Name of the Lord<br />
Being to Drink of the Life of the Lord</h2>
<p>Now we need to see how to enjoy the riches of the Spirit. Since the Spirit is likened to water, we need to drink of this Spirit and even drink in this Spirit. We have received an all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit is likened to water, and we have all been given to drink of this one Spirit. For many years I knew that I needed to drink the Spirit, but I did not know how to drink. Now I know that the only way to drink is to breathe in the Lord by calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; When we call on the Lord, we are breathing in the Lord, and our breathing is our drinking.</p>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #73 speaks of breathing the name of Jesus and of drinking of life. Watchman Nee received great help from the author of this hymn, Miss M. E. Barber. The second stanza of the hymn says, &ldquo;Blessed Jesus! Mighty Savior! / In Thy Name is all I need; / Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed.&rdquo; Miss Barber was quite experienced in the Lord, and she discovered that to breathe the name of the Lord is to drink of the Lord&rsquo;s life. Just to breathe the name of Jesus is to drink of life indeed. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; we are breathing, and our breathing is our drinking. Hence, we can drink the Lord by calling on His name.</p>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #255, which was written by A. B. Simpson, who founded the Christian and Missionary Alliance in America, also speaks of breathing the Lord. Brother Simpson was raised up by the Lord in the mid-nineteenth century and served the Lord first in Canada and later in the United States. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Pentecostal movement was quite prevailing in the United States, and Brother Simpson was also involved in it. However, when the Pentecostals went to the extreme of saying that speaking in tongues was a requirement for receiving the Holy Spirit, Brother Simpson did not approve.</p>
<p>We have at least ten hymns in our hymnal that were written by A. B. Simpson, such as, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #482), &ldquo;Once it was the blessing, / Now it is the Lord&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #513), and &ldquo;Jesus only is our message&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #511). <em>Hymns,</em> #255 speaks of breathing the Lord in stanza 7, saying, &ldquo;I am breathing every moment, / Drawing all my life from Thee; / Breath by breath I live upon Thee, / Lord, Thy Spirit breathe in me.&rdquo; The experience of this hymn is very rich; the author was breathing continuously, drawing his life from the Lord. Although many of God&rsquo;s children have gone astray, there is a practical, simple, convenient, and proper way to breathe in and receive the Lord&rsquo;s life every moment.</p>
<p>If the sisters would continually call on the Lord as they are taking care of household duties, they would breathe out their temper and concerns and breathe in the heavenly air. This heavenly air is the Lord Jesus. Brother Simpson was full of experience. He said, &ldquo;I am breathing out my sin.&rdquo; When he called &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; sin was breathed out from within him. Then he would breathe in more of the Lord&rsquo;s riches so that breath by breath the Lord was manifested through him. This is truly a good hymn. I once introduced it to an American preacher who had been preaching for twenty-five years. When I introduced this hymn to him, he did not approve of it; he believed that it was quite strange. Several years later, however, he told me that this hymn was the best and most spiritual hymn, because it is not doctrinal. It was written by a person who was involved in the Pentecostal movement but who also was concerned that speaking in tongues was being overemphasized. Even though we emphasize the experience of the Spirit, we should not take the way of speaking in tongues or of foretelling but the way of breathing in the Lord by calling on His name. This is the proper way.</p>
<p>Recently, some opposers said that calling on the Lord is good for new believers but that there is no need to call once a believer has grown. This is indeed nonsense. If my parents were alive today, I would still address them as father and mother. There is no graduation from calling on the Lord, because we always need to breathe. Since calling on the name of the Lord is breathing, we should not say that there is no need to breathe simply because we are grown up. No matter how old a person is, he still needs to breathe in order to live. We can graduate from many things, but we cannot graduate from breathing. Hence, we should not say that breathing is something only for &ldquo;children&rdquo; but not for &ldquo;adults.&rdquo; We will call upon the name of the Lord for eternity. Even in the New Jerusalem in eternity future, we will be calling upon the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 13:11 says, &ldquo;When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; since I have become a man, I have done away with childish things.&rdquo; Speaking in tongues keeps us in a childish stage, but in the coming age the matured believers will grow up, and these childish gifts, especially the lesser gifts, such as prophecies and speaking in tongues, will be rendered useless and cease (v. 8). However, calling on the name of the Lord is a matter for eternity. The way for us to enjoy the Lord is to call upon His name; therefore, we should never forsake calling upon His name. Many of us can testify that if we were not allowed to call upon the name of the Lord, it would be very distressing to us. Calling upon the name of the Lord is a spontaneous life practice in our Christian living. I call upon Him every day, even when I am getting dressed, tying my tie, combing my hair, and walking or riding in a car. I call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; and it is so sweet.</p>
