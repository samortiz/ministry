<p>Rest means satisfaction. God&rsquo;s desire to be expressed and to deal with His enemy depends on man. When man has the image of God, he can express God, and when man has the authority of God, he can rule for God and deal with God&rsquo;s enemy. When this twofold desire is fulfilled in man, God is satisfied; that is, He has rest. Therefore, another aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man is to have rest by being satisfied through man.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:3 says, &ldquo;God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.&rdquo; This verse marks the completion of the account of creation in the Bible, because symbolically God attained His purpose and was satisfied. God gained a creature who had His image to express Him and His authority to rule for Him. When God saw the man whom He had created, He was satisfied and had rest.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Sabbath Rest</h2>
<p>The rest in God&rsquo;s creation was only partially fulfilled in terms of reality, because God&rsquo;s eternal desire and purpose were not completely fulfilled, and even to this day they are still not fulfilled. Because of man&rsquo;s fall, God has been working continuously to fulfill His purpose. Hence, when the Lord healed the man who had been in sickness for thirty-eight years on the Sabbath, He said, &ldquo;My Father is working until now, and I also am working&rdquo; (John 5:17). All God&rsquo;s work today is for the accomplishment of His purpose so that He may have rest. God&rsquo;s satisfaction and rest are a great matter. From eternity God has been longing for rest.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God ordained the Sabbath for His people to remember His rest in creation. The Sabbath was also for His people to testify that He desires to have rest among His people on the earth. Exodus 20:8-11 says, &ldquo;Remember the Sabbath day so as to sanctify it. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Jehovah your God; you shall not do any work, you nor your son nor your daughter, your male servant nor your female servant, nor your cattle nor the sojourner with you, who is within your gates. For in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore Jehovah blessed the Sabbath day and sanctified it.&rdquo; God commanded the children of Israel to keep the Sabbath by not working on it, in order to testify that God rested on the Sabbath and that man should obey God&rsquo;s authority and live by His will. The Sabbath is a type that shows how God values rest and how man can give God rest.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Rest in the New Testament Age</h2>
<p>Why is there the Lord&rsquo;s Day in the New Testament age? The Lord&rsquo;s Day is also a type of rest. It signifies that through death and resurrection the Lord entered into glory as the full expression of God and as the Ruler ascended to the heavens to be far above all God&rsquo;s enemies. Furthermore, the significance of the Lord&rsquo;s Day also shows that those who are joined to the Lord in His name are where He is. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s Day indicates not only that God&rsquo;s twofold purpose was fulfilled in the Lord Jesus and that God rested in Him; the Lord&rsquo;s Day indicates also that God&rsquo;s twofold purpose is fulfilled in His believers and that God rests in them. Therefore, while we are breaking the bread to remember the Lord on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, we should release the Lord&rsquo;s life and express Him. We should also be overcomers who exercise the Lord&rsquo;s authority to deal with His enemy. Only in this way can we realize the meaning of the rest on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>Based on the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, the Holy Spirit entered into us. As a result, we can have a foretaste of the rest in reality. We should be in this foretaste not only on the Lord&rsquo;s Day but also on the other days of the week. As long as we allow the life of God to flow out from us so that God can be expressed through us and also allow the authority of God to be carried out through us so that God&rsquo;s enemy can be dealt with, we can fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and give God satisfaction and rest.</p>
<p>Individual believers can fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and give Him rest, and the church corporately can fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and give Him rest. Ephesians speaks of this. On the one hand, the church is the Body of Christ, &ldquo;the fullness of the One who fills all in all&rdquo; (1:23), and the individual believers need to &ldquo;be filled unto all the fullness of God&rdquo; (3:19). On the other hand, the church needs to &ldquo;put on the whole armor of God&rdquo; to fight against the enemy and stand against the stratagems of the devil (6:11-13). The former verses speak of the church being filled with God and expressing God; the latter verses speak of the church dealing with Satan. God can have rest in such a church, and the church can have a foretaste of all the blessings in His rest.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Resting in the Millennial Kingdom</h2>
<p>In a very real sense, the rest that God has today is only partial; it is a miniature and a symbol of the rest that God had on the seventh day of creation. It is not until the coming of the millennial kingdom that God will gain in reality a group of people who are exactly the same as the Lord (1 John 3:2) to express the glory of God (Col. 3:4; 1 Thes. 2:12), to reign with the Lord (Rev. 20:6), and to put His enemy, Satan, into the abyss (vv. 1-3). Then there will be a great rest, which is the completion of God&rsquo;s rest. This is the rest in the millennial kingdom prophesied in Psalm 95:6-11 and referred to in Hebrews 4:3-11.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Resting in the New Heaven and the New Earth</h2>
<p>The rest in the millennial kingdom will still not be full or complete. God&rsquo;s work in the universe will not be consummated until there are the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem. Only then will God be fully expressed and His authority fully established. Then God&rsquo;s desire and purpose will be fully accomplished, and God will gain eternal rest.</p>
<p>Revelation 21 through 22 shows the two aspects of God&rsquo;s purpose in the New Jerusalem. On the one hand, the New Jerusalem has the image of God. The entire city is like God. God is jasper, and the New Jerusalem is also jasper (4:3; 21:11). The New Jerusalem refers to God&rsquo;s redeemed throughout the ages (vv. 12, 14). In the new heaven and the new earth, all God&rsquo;s redeemed people will receive His dispensing to be exactly the same as God, expressing Him. Those who read Revelation know that the entire city of the New Jerusalem is an expression of God. The city radiates God&rsquo;s glory and splendor (21:11). God is expressed and shined forth through the city. God finally gains a full expression of Himself in the new universe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, God&rsquo;s redeemed ones not only express the glory of God but also reign for eternity (22:5). By the time of the new heaven and the new earth, Satan will be cast into the lake of fire (20:10), and God&rsquo;s redeemed will reign as kings. To reign as kings is to shame the enemy. Therefore, when God&rsquo;s purpose is fully accomplished in eternity, there will still be the two aspects of the image of God and the authority of God. The image of God is attained by the redeemed ones expressing God, and the authority of God is manifested by the redeemed ones shaming God&rsquo;s enemy. Then God will have full and complete rest.</p>
<p>This rest is from God&rsquo;s side. God needs to satisfy His heart&rsquo;s desire so that He may have rest. However, this rest is not only for God but also for man. God needs rest, and man needs rest. If God can rest in man, man can also have rest because of God&rsquo;s rest. Therefore, man must allow God to fulfill His purpose before he can have rest. Regardless of whether the rest is in God&rsquo;s creation, in the Old Testament Sabbath, in the Lord&rsquo;s Day in the New Testament, in the millennial kingdom, or in the new heaven and the new earth, man can enjoy rest together with God because he has allowed God to fulfill His purpose.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God's Desire and Purpose in Creation &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
