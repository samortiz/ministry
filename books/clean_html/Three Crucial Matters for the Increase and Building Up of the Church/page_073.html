<h1 class="title">BEING WITNESSES OF JESUS CHRIST</h1>
<h2 class="head1">WITNESSING THE CRUCIFIED AND<br />
RESURRECTED CHRIST</h2>
<p>According to the revelation in the book of Acts, everyone who is raised up and sent out by the Lord is a witness of the Lord. Acts 1:8 says, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; Here the word <em>witnesses</em> is not related to our normal understanding of a witness who gives testimony in a legal case in a law court. In the New Testament the meaning of a witness is primarily to bear a living testimony of Jesus Christ in His crucifixion and resurrection. This is repeatedly emphasized in the book of Acts (v. 22; 2:32; 5:32; 26:16).</p>
<h2 class="head1">WITNESSING THAT CHRIST LIVES IN US</h2>
<p>How can we be the living witnesses of the Lord Jesus? Being a living witness does not merely involve saying that Jesus has resurrected. The fact that we are here is proof that He has resurrected. We are His living witnesses. If Jesus had not resurrected, we would not be able to live the way we do today. We would still be alive, but we would not live as we do today. When Peter stood and spoke for God, his expression, spirit, and fearless attitude demonstrated that the living Jesus was within him (2:14-36). When Peter was speaking, he was a living witness of the fact that the crucified and resurrected Jesus lived within him. If Jesus had not resurrected, He could not live within Peter.</p>
<p>Many Bible readers do not have this understanding of the word <em>witness;</em> even our understanding is not this deep. In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; This is the meaning of being a witness. A witness is a person who has Christ living in him. The chorus of a hymn says, &ldquo;He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today! /...You ask me how I know He lives? / He lives within my heart&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #503). His living in us proves that He has resurrected and that He is living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A LIVING IN DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The life that Jesus lived on earth was not a living in the natural life but a living that was in death and resurrection, a living that passed through the cross. His death involved many things. The death of Jesus was not merely during the few hours He spent on the cross; He was dying during the more than thirty years that He was on earth. In fact, He died daily. The living of Jesus on earth was a living that continually passed through death. This death delivered Him from everything that was outside of God.</p>
<p>Death is a great deliverance. When we die, we are delivered from every form of disturbance, entanglement, and pressure. As Christians, we are troubled by the world, sin, and Satan. Sin includes not only outward sinful acts but also the sinful nature within us. Within us, our natural man is composed of the self, the flesh, lusts, and our sinful nature. Hence, there are three outward items that trouble us and four inward items that bother us. One of these items, sin, exists outside of us and within us. These seven items bother us continually.</p>
<p>As witnesses, we must live a witnessing life. This is a life that lives out the living of Jesus in death and resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s death delivers us from the world, sin, and Satan; it also delivers us from the self, the flesh, lusts, and indwelling sin.</p>
<p>The Bible refers to the spread of the gospel and also to the spread of the kingdom of God. The spread of the gospel is actually the spread of the Lord Jesus, but how does He spread? After the Lord Jesus was raised from the dead, His spread involved His delivering His seekers from the world, sin, Satan, and the self. The Lord Jesus did not live by the lust of the flesh, and He was delivered from the self. In the Gospel of John the Lord repeatedly said that He did not speak from Himself, nor did He do anything by Himself; He was not the source of anything that He did (6:38; 12:49; 14:10). This is to be delivered from the self. The Lord lived a life in death that had no relationship with the self. He did not have sin, the flesh, or lust. When we go out to spread the gospel, we should live this kind of living so that people can see that we have passed through death; in us the world has been judged, Satan has been destroyed, and our self, the flesh, lusts, and sin are also judged.</p>
<p>Someone asked about staying in the home of the new believers. We should all know that to stay in someone&rsquo;s home is not the same as merely staying in a physical house. There is absolutely no problem with a house, but there can be a problem with the people living in the house. Suppose a couple, their elderly mother, and four children live in a house. It will not be a simple matter for us to live with these seven people, because the world, sin, Satan, the self, the flesh, lusts, and the sinful nature are with us. These seven problems are also with every person in the house. We can imagine the situations that can arise when eight people live together under the same roof.</p>
<p>A newly baptized believer may rejoice over his baptism and want to receive us into his home. However, we should not think that his baptism has terminated these seven problems. We still have these seven problems. Some saints were baptized more than ten years ago and have participated in the church life for seven or eight years. They may even have served the Lord full time for several years, yet they are not completely freed from these seven problems. They are not clean; they still have germs. We are full of germs. When a surgeon operates on a patient, the entire operating room must be sterilized. Moreover, the doctor must wear a sterilized garment and gloves, and the patient must be cleaned. If the operating room and the people involved are not clean, the patient may catch some germs during the operation, and this may result in a more serious condition. Thus, if we stay in the same house with others, who have the same germs that we have, how can we expect not to have any problems?</p>
