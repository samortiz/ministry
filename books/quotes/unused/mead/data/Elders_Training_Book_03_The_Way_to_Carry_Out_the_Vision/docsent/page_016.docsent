   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, LIFE, AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another principle which we must take in our interpretation of the Bible is the principle of four items: Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first principle we have seen is a general principle the Triune God dispensing Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second principle is in more detail with Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we see a third principle of Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Any message or any development of the Bible without Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church is an empty shell with no content.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The content of the Bible is Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At least one of these items must be present in your development of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also, in your preaching of the gospel at least one of these items should be present.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I saw some evangelists in China who preached quite prevailingly, but in their gospel they did not preach much reality of Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their prevailing evangelical work attracted a good number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, many of these people turned to the way of the Lord s recovery to pick up Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They all remained and became very useful to the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who did not turn this way, including the evangelists, either disappeared or still remained with emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In their gospel campaigns a number were saved, but after ten years many disappeared or remained empty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must thank the Lord, however, that many also turned this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ones who turned this way not only remained but they became solid with the truth concerning Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>D. L. Moody s preaching, comparatively speaking, was more solid than any other evangelist in England.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you compare Moody s messages to the other evangelists messages of his day, you can see that with Moody s messages there is some solid content, while with the others you can see mostly eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some evangelists preach with eloquent illustrations to attract people to stir up their interest, but after being interested, all that is left with them is a good story.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many are merely eloquent speakers with very little Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Based upon this principle, we should check today s preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How much Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church is in today s preaching of the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows us the emptiness of today s preaching and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You should not develop the truth in the Bible in this way, in an empty way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must develop the biblical truth in the way of Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if you have a good portion of the Word with a good idea to stir up people s interest, you must consider whether or not Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church are the content of your message.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they are not the content, you should forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not go further to develop anything apart from this governing principle because you will waste your time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Also, you will have no safeguard and you will be led astray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the heresies came in by the way of developing the truth in the Bible apart from Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Any doctrine developed apart from these four items will issue in heresy or division.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Presbyterian church came into existence because they developed the doctrine of presbytery without Christ, without the Spirit, without life, and without the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they had developed the truth of the presbytery with the church, they would have dared not set up a Presbyterian church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Presbyterian church became one among many divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some even developed the doctrine of holiness apart from Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We, however, should develop the doctrine of holiness with Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to tell people that holiness is Christ Himself, and this Christ today is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only is His Spirit called the Holy Spirit, but also He is called the life-giving Spirit who imparts the divine life into us for our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Holiness is God s nature and is related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you do not have God s life, you do not have God s nature, which is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If God s holiness is going to be increased within you, you must live according to God s nature and by God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must also realize that this holy life should not only be for our personal living but it must also be a part of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would develop the doctrine of holiness with Christ, with the Spirit, with life, and with the church, we would see a marvelous revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Otherwise, a holiness sect will be created.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why some have established holiness churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These are actually holiness divisions cutting the Body into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is dangerous to develop any biblical doctrine apart from Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To do this could lead to division.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Your doctrine, on the other hand, may not be wrong, but eventually the issue of your practice will be a division.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is always safe to develop any doctrine in the Bible with Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even if something is good and scriptural, never develop it apart from Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While the principle of dispensations helps in interpreting the Bible, it is too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Always remember these three intrinsic principles of developing the truth in the Bible: the Triune God dispensing Himself into His chosen and redeemed people; Christ and the church; and Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
