   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now that this distraction is apparently over, the churches seem to be doing quite well, to be going on steadily.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From my observation, however, I would say that their attention is not fully centered on the focus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some places are centered on good meetings; others, on the proper increase.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By proper increase I do not mean the kind that was promoted from 1973 to 1978; I mean the proper increase.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some churches are endeavoring to build up their kind of church in their locality, with a bigger number, with more vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because they realize they cannot do that much, they invite me and others as well, to go and help.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brothers, even if you visit five or ten churches, I doubt you will find one whose church life is really centered on the focus of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not like to disappoint you and be unappreciative of all your good points, while pointing out your shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I do not like to do that, but my burden is to tell you frankly and honestly that the actual condition of the churches is not that encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether you feel encouraged or not depends upon your point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why I say we must pray desperately that we may see the Lord s real testimony today, His real recovery, His real move.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once you have seen this, you will have the right point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then you will not be satisfied with the condition of the churches because it is hard to find one that is centered on God s focus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must look to the Lord that we may concentrate everything our time, our energy, our physical, material things on this one thing, that is, the testimony of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need more prayer, more fellowship, more meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are here only for this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course, we have to do something to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That is a necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But apart from having a job to make a living, we have no necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are not for a good living, pleasure, enjoyment on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are here only for the Lord s recovery of His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not merely for good meetings, high meetings, living meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are not merely for good Bible teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nor are we merely for good gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are for a living testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not use the excuse that the saints in your locality are too new to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if we are preaching the gospel to sinners who are hearing it for the first time in their whole life, you can still preach the Father s nature, the Son s embodiment, and the Spirit s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What we speak depends on how much we have seen the central focus, and how much we are burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must first check ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Have I seen the real focus of God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Am I burdened with this?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Or is what I say merely what I have heard about the local church, about the ground, about this and that teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem lies with us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have not seen, then we are just doing a Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are merely helping people to know God in a general way and perhaps to take the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But is there a lampstand?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church ground is not the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>BECOMING DOCTRINAL</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some of the dear leaders in the local churches even stress the matter of the ground not in the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ground in some leaders minds has become a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I gave you ten messages on The Genuine Ground of Oneness in 1979 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My reason for giving those messages was because many of the leading ones understood the ground in a doctrinal way, not from the life point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those messages were given from the life viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers, forgive me for my frankness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I wonder how many of you have gotten into those ten messages.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No need to say the elders far away from here, even you who have been here with me at least six years, I doubt that you have really gotten into those messages, which speak of the genuine oneness from the life point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brothers, nothing can keep you in the recovery, nothing can keep you one with the brothers, except this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul says, I was not disobedient to the...vision Acts 26:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only this can keep us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It has to be our life, our living, our work, our burden, our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Surely we must preach the gospel, but we preach with this as the focus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Surely we must expound the Bible, but we teach with this as the focus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Surely we want good meetings and a good church life, but the meetings and the church life must have this as the focus.</S>
