   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lowliness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first virtue is lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many translations of the Bible render the word lowliness in Ephesians 4:2 as humility.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But lowliness is very different from humility.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A king or a president may be very humble and yet still remain in his high position.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although he may be humble, he may still remain in his dignity and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus was not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was equal with God, but He did not regard His equality with God as a thing to be grasped Phil 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He not only became humble, but He left His high position and came down to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was His lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, He not only came down to the low level of man, but even to the lowest level of a slave Phil 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the Lord Jesus was in the form of God, He did not grasp that form.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, He left that high position, the position of God, and came down to the low position of man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, as a man He became a slave, and as a man-slave, one day He washed the feet of the disciples John 13:1-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How low the Lord Jesus became!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When He washed the feet of Peter, John, James, and all the disciples, He was lower than all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whoever washes the feet of another person must be lower than the one whose feet he washes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the church life, the first virtue needed is lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be lowly is to remain in a low estate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are an elder, you must not remain in the estate of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must come down from the level of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Come down to wash the feet of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1952, in Taipei the five elders washed the feet of nearly one thousand brothers in one meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That was a real renewing of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows that all the elders came down from the elder level.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They became lower than all the brothers, and that washed away all the complaints, all the dissatisfactions, and all the murmurings and gossipings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, that brought in the real oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 11:29 the Lord said that He is meek and lowly in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are the same virtues needed in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church life, we all should have lowliness and meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus was the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was very high, but He came down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He left the high level, and He became low by becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then as a man, He came down further from the level of man to the level of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One day the disciples were quarreling concerning who was the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus seemed to tell them, If you want to become great, you have to be low.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Among you there is no ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All of you are brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whoever would be great must be a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have to serve your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You must be like Me. I came not to be served, but to serve others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you not remember that I washed your feet?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Mark 10:36-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to practice lowliness in the church life, none of the brothers or sisters, older ones or younger ones, should remain in a high estate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All of us must come down from our throne.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must come down to a low level.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all have to become low.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lowliness is the first virtue needed in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Meekness</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The second virtue needed in the church life is meekness Eph 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is meekness?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Humanly speaking, we may consider meekness to be the same as gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If someone is gentle, walks slowly, and speaks slowly and softly, we consider him to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But in the New Testament, meekness denotes much more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Meekness in the Bible means not to fight for oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord Jesus told us that if anyone wants our jacket, we should give him our jacket and also our shirt Matt 5:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In human society it is different.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If someone takes another s jacket, they will fight over the jacket.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To be meek is to be like a lamb brought to the slaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The lamb does not fight; it simply goes without resisting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord Jesus was such a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When He was about to be crucified, He was brought to the slaughter like a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He did not resist and He did not fight; He simply gave in. If I am meek and you want me to walk with you for one mile, I will walk with you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eventually, I would even walk another mile for you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I would not fight or resist but give in. If you want to occupy more than one fourth of the bench, I will give you half of the bench.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you want half of the bench, I will give you two thirds of the bench.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you want two thirds, I will give you the entire bench.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you say that you are right and I am wrong, I would not try to prove that you are wrong and I am right.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Meekness is not to fight, but always to give in. In the lawcourt there is no meekness; there is only fighting for righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In a court of law people fight to find out who is right and who is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But we all must realize that the church life is not a court of law.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We may illustrate the virtue of meekness by the story of a sister whose husband always came home very late at night.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The sister insisted that her husband was wrong and would not open the door for him when he came home.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>She purposely kept him outside knocking until an hour passed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Eventually, she would open the door for him, and then she would slam it shut.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I advised her not to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I suggested that every night while her husband was away she should make some very good dessert and tea and have it ready for him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then she should wait by the door until he returned, even if it was after midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When she heard his steps, she should open the door and say, Welcome home.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Here is some tea and dessert.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After hearing my words, the sister told me that it was impossible for her to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I said to her, Yes, you cannot do it, but the Lord Jesus within you can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Eventually, I convinced her that this was the only way she would gain her husband, and she went back home to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Later she told me that not only did her husband stop going away at night, but he even began to go to the meetings with her.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is a real illustration of virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>With us there should be no legality, no fighting, no quarreling, but giving in. If your husband likes to go out, walk him to the door and say, Good-by, and have a good time.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Even if you know that he is going to the theater, you should still wish him a good time and be ready to welcome him back.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is not legality but meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To be meek is to give in.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When we give in, we give the Lord an opportunity to come in to bless the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is why we must forget the past.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>To forget the past means to give in. If you still hold on to the past, you are struggling, you are fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This kind of fighting is endless.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Instead, you must give in. To forgive is to give in, and to give in is to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is very hard for us Christians to forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Often our forgiveness may be likened to burying a dead dog, but keeping the tail outside the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>After we have buried the dead dog, we may boast to our friends that we have forgiven others and have buried the past.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>After boasting in this way, we then show them the tail of the dead dog.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Quite often the wives may forgive their husbands in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>And sometimes some of the saints may testify in the meeting, The elders offended me, but one day by the Lord s mercy I forgave them all.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Since they forgave them all, why did they need to come to the meeting to tell people?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>That means they buried the dog, but still kept the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We need to drop the tail, to give in and forget the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Then we should not say anything further concerning the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In the church life we should never struggle for anything, and we should never insist on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Meekness is simply to give in. Do not insist, do not attack others, and do not struggle for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Just give in. Then you will have peace in the church life.</S>
