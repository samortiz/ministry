   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>So, especially after we have been trained, there is no church to which we can go that matches our requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In a sense our training qualifies us to put forth our requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We would all like to go to a place where the elders are so positive and one with us to help us carry out what we have been trained to do.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But where is such a church that is positively taking the new way according to what we have been hearing in the training and where all of the elders are really one with us?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we go to serve the Lord, we should not have any choice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the churches are good.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No church is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regardless of how much training we have received, every church is good for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, suppose a church is opposing the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is that still the church or not?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is a genuine local church since it is still right in its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is also right in its ground.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is the church in a certain city.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, it is right in its element.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is sanctified in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though a church opposes the new way to the uttermost, it is still the church if it is right in its nature, element, and ground.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, would we recognize it as the church?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the Lord speaks to us to go to that church to serve Him, would we go there?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to go; we have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No church is not good for us to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regardless of its situation and condition, as long as it is right in its nature, in its element, and in its ground, it is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as it is the church of God in a certain city and sanctified in Christ, it is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must go and serve there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should never go there to revolt, revolutionize everything, or do something to chase away the elders and set up new elders.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To revolt is wrong, to revolutionize is wrong, and to chase away the elders is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to go along with the church and with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not rekindle a fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, this does not mean that we should not practice what we have been trained to do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can still practice the preaching of the gospel, the feeding of the lambs, the perfecting of the saints, and the raising up of others to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may say that to do this is against what the church practices there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But whether it is against what that church is practicing or not depends on how we carry out these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we go to a church which is opposing the new way and we are not allowed to revolt, to revolutionize anything, to chase anyone away, or to rekindle a fire, we can still preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No one would condemn us just because we are preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should just go to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must go to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we reach their door, we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not promote or declare that we practice door knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no need to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But we do tell people that we have a burden to save the sinners and to visit our relatives, friends, and colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do have a genuine burden to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No one would condemn any kind of preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should just go.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If there is the need of a telephone call, we just make the telephone calls.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there is the need of knocking on doors, we just do it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If there is the need of writing a letter, we just do it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not promote it, and do not impose any point on anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should do the preaching of the gospel in the way that we have been trained.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not advertise, and do not declare that we are going to visit people by knocking on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may preach the gospel by door knocking, by telephone calls, or by writing letters.</S>
