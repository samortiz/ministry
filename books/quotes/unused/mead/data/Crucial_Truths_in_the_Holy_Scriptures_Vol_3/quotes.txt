[1]  Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 3 CONTENTS
[2]  In order for the children of God, especially new believers, to receive a greater supply of the Word, we, by the Lord s grace, wish to present some crucial truths in the Holy Scriptures so that the children of God may receive a foundation in the Word of God.
[3]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT
[4]  Being filled with the Holy Spirit is a great topic in the Bible, and it has been the subject of much debate throughout the past centuries.
[5]  We look to the Lord for His special grace to bring us into the truth concerning this matter through the Spirit of reality who indwells us.
[6]  Conversely, those who emphasize the subjective aspect pay too much attention to the experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit, but they completely neglect the doctrine concerning the filling of the Holy Spirit.
[7]  For this, we must exercise not only our mind to understand the doctrine and truth concerning the filling of the Holy Spirit but also our spirit to pursue the experience and gain the reality of being filled by the Holy Spirit.
[8]  I send forth the promise of My Father upon you; but as for you, stay in the city until you put on power from on high ; Wait for the promise of the Father...You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4-8 .
[9]  He repeated the Father s promise in the Old Testament concerning the Holy Spirit to His disciples, promising to pour out the Holy Spirit upon them as power when He ascended to the heavens.
[10]  Therefore, the Lord s promise before His death and His promise after His resurrection relate to the two aspects of the Holy Spirit.
[11]  He rose from the dead through the Holy Spirit, through which He was designated the Son of God in power Rom 1:4 and through which His disciples were regenerated 1 Pet 1:3 , making them His brothers and the Father s many sons.
[12]  The Holy Spirit descends upon us so that we may receive power to witness for the Lord.
[13]  This clearly shows that the function of the Holy Spirit as power is not related to the inward life we receive from the Lord but to the outward work we do for the Lord.
[14]  When the Spirit of power promised by the Father descends upon us, we receive power from on high and are able to preach the gospel of the Lord to the uttermost parts of the earth.
[15]  For our inward life God gave us the Holy Spirit as the Comforter so that He could be the Revealer, Leader, Supplier, and Maintainer of life within us.
[16]  For our outward work, God gave us the Holy Spirit as power so that He could be the power, authority, ability, and skill of our work.
[17]  The Experience of the Two Aspects The Lord Jesus
[18]  No one can doubt that the life in Him was fully of the Holy Spirit.
[19]  Before He was baptized at the age of thirty, He was filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit.
[20]  He was full of the Holy Spirit; thus, He was able to live for God and to be occupied with the things of God 2:49 .
[21]  He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him ; The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel Matt 3:16; Luke 4:18 .
[22]  The Lord was conceived and born of the Holy Spirit and His inward life was fully of the Holy Spirit.
[23]  Prior to His baptism, He lived before God, but He was not yet working for God in His ministry.
[24]  In addition, Peter, who rarely understood the Lord s words and could not clearly speak of them, was able to understand the Bible and to explain it very clearly even though he had not received the Holy Spirit in the aspect of power at Pentecost vv.
[25]  Although they had the Holy Spirit of life inwardly, enabling them to have the Lord s life and the supply and sustenance of the Lord s life, they did not have the Holy Spirit of power outwardly, which would enable them to testify for the Lord and preach the gospel.
[26]  Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them ; They believed Philip, who announced the gospel of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ ; In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise Acts 8:5, 12; Eph 1:13 .
[27]  Ephesians 1:13 speaks of God s principle involving man s receiving the Holy Spirit based on faith.
[28]  When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John...so that they might receive the Holy Spirit...Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit Acts 8:14-17 .
[29]  Although the believers in Samaria experienced the Holy Spirit entering into them inwardly as life through faith, they did not experience the Holy Spirit falling upon them outwardly as power until the apostles came and laid hands on them.
[30]  They think that even though the Samaritans believed in the Lord s name, they did not receive the Holy Spirit until the apostles came and laid hands on them.
[31]  Since the Samaritans heard the complete gospel from Philip the evangelist and believed in this gospel and in the Lord s name, they must have received the Holy Spirit inwardly.
[32]  They said that a believer needs only to obey the Holy Spirit in order to be filled with the Holy Spirit because a believer receives the Holy Spirit when he believes in the Lord.
[33]  Since there is an inward and an outward aspect in the Holy Spirit s relationship with the believers, there is an inward and an outward aspect to being filled with the Holy Spirit.
[34]  The different aspects of the filling of the Holy Spirit are even referenced in the New Testament with different words in Greek.
[35]  If we are not filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly, we cannot have a daily life that is according to the Spirit, and it will be impossible for our spiritual life to mature.
[36]  by the Holy Spirit Inwardly The Overflow of Life
[37]  This shows that those who believe into the Lord can receive the Holy Spirit to such an extent that they richly overflow with the waters of life.
[38]  Since the Holy Spirit within us is the Spirit of life, He will bear these nine beautiful fruits of the spiritual life within us if we give Him the opportunity to fill us.
[39]  When we put our flesh and all that is of the flesh in a position of death in Christ s death on the cross, not allowing the flesh or the things of the flesh to have any ground in us, the Holy Spirit will gain the position in us to completely possess and fill us.
[40]  Believing in the Inward Filling of the Holy Spirit
[41]  Once we receive the dealing of the cross and consecrate ourselves, we must believe.
[42]  First, we should believe that the Holy Spirit will fill us.
[43]  The Holy Spirit is within us and desires to fill us; He is only waiting for us to give Him more ground in our being.
[44]  Since the Holy Spirit is desiring and waiting to fill us, we should believe that He not only will fill us but that He has already filled us after we empty our inward parts and consecrate to Him.
[45]  When the Bible uses the word pletho to speak of the filling of the Holy Spirit, it is referring to the outward filling of the Holy Spirit upon us.
[46]  In his prophecy the One baptizing was the Lord Jesus, not the Holy Spirit.
[47]  Similarly, when we speak of being baptized with the Holy Spirit, our focus should be on our entrance into and covering by the Spirit, not on the Spirit s entrance into us.
[48]  They were all filled with the Holy Spirit...This is what is spoken through the prophet Joel: And it shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh ; Having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this ; The Holy Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word...On the Gentiles also the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out Acts 2:4, 16-17, 33; 10:44-45 .
[49]  The Fact of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit
[50]  In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks 1 Cor 12:13 .
[51]  Consequently, when we believe in the Lord we partake of this accomplished fact whether we are a Jew or a Gentile.
[52]  Just as the Lord s death is an accomplished fact, the baptism of the Spirit is an accomplished fact.
[53]  In God s eyes, according to the fact, they are already dead because they are joined to the Lord s death.
[54]  In the same way, once a person believes in the Lord and is joined to the church, which is the Body of Christ, he also receives and partakes of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, which is upon the church.
[55]  with the Holy Spirit Causing Spiritual Work to Have Power
[56]  You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses...unto the uttermost part of the earth ; As the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled...they were all filled with the Holy Spirit Acts 1:8; 2:1, 4; see also Luke 24:49 .
[57]  The Holy Spirit within us causes us to repent, to listen to God s word, and to know the Lord.
[58]  Many who are saved and come to the Lord are unable to bring others to salvation and to the Lord because they lack the outward filling of the Holy Spirit.
[59]  Many brothers and sisters read the Bible, pray, and truly love the Lord, but they are not released in their gospel preaching and are afraid to testify for the Lord.
[60]  Having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear...Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified Acts 2:33, 36 .
[61]  Peter and the first one hundred twenty disciples were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.
[62]  When they received it, there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and the Holy Spirit filled the house where they were sitting.
[63]  They were all outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues even as the Spirit gave them to speak forth.
[64]  The Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied Acts 19:6; see also Luke 1:67 .
[65]  When the Ephesian believers were filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, they not only spoke in tongues but also prophesied.
[66]  Thus, prophesying is another manifestation of being filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit.
[67]  Of the five examples of the outward filling of the Holy Spirit recorded in Acts, speaking in tongues is mentioned only in regard to the disciples on the day of Pentecost, those in Cornelius s house, and the Ephesian believers.
[68]  Therefore, we dare not preach, as certain groups preach, that a person must speak in tongues in order to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit.
[69]  When we repent and turn to God, after we have dealt with and cleared up our sins, we must believe that we are baptized in the Holy Spirit.
[70]  Therefore, we should ask the Lord to bring us into a normal condition of having those among us who could represent the Body and lay hands on the brothers and sisters so that the anointing on the Body could flow greatly among us, causing many to receive the outward filling of the Holy Spirit.
[71]  CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT PREACHING THE GOSPEL THE CALL FROM FOUR DIRECTIONS The Lord s Only Commandment at His Departure Speaking Forth a Call from the Heavens Above
[72]  Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation ; Go therefore and disciple all the nations Mark 16:15; Matt 28:19; see also Rom 10:14-15 .
[73]  The best way to preach the gospel is to testify how the Lord saved us and how we experienced the Lord s salvation through His death and resurrection on our behalf.
[74]  He who reaps...gathers fruit unto eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together...One sows and another reaps John 4:36-37 .
[75]  The word of the Lord s gospel is the seed of life, and a person s heart is like a field of earth for planting.
[76]  When we preach the gospel to people, we are sowing the seed of the Lord s gospel into the field of their hearts.
[77]  Being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus Acts 18:25 .
[78]  If we want to preach the gospel, we must be fervent in spirit.
[79]  The spirit of the gospel also causes people to preach the gospel in season and out of season without choosing a time or place according to their preference.
[80]  THE AUTHORITY OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL The Authority of Christ
[81]  All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.
[82]  Often when we are on the way to preach the gospel or are preaching the gospel, we encounter difficulties that require us not only to pray for a solution but also to apply the Lord s authority to deal with the power behind the difficulties.
[83]  Sometimes we cannot release the word of God through ministry, but we can release it through prayer; sometimes we cannot speak the word of God into people, but we can pray it into them.
[84]  When we preach the gospel, we must avoid debating with people.
[85]  Once a person is saved, he should preach the gospel and serve the Lord.
[86]  Every normal Christian preaches the gospel and serves the Lord.
[87]  Furthermore, the more a Christian receives grace, the more he will receive the Lord s leading and dealing and the more he will be able to serve the Lord in a proper way.
[88]  If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant will be John 12:26 .
[89]  When the Lord was on earth, He walked a path that we must follow in order to serve Him.
[90]  If we do not serve by the counsel of God, we are merely serving people, not serving God.
[91]  Meeting with one another is a very important Christian practice, so we will consider it carefully.
[92]  If two or three believers are gathered into the Lord s name, He promises that He will be in their midst.
[93]  When we personally contact the Lord, we surely can touch His sweet presence and receive His grace, but we receive a different supply in the meetings.
[94]  Even though the blessing that we receive in our personal contact with the Lord cannot be replaced by what we receive in the meetings, the presence of the Lord in the meetings provides a supply that cannot be obtained through only personal contact with the Lord.
[95]  We gathered together to break bread ; Come together...to eat the Lord s supper Acts 20:7; 1 Cor 11:20 .
[96]  The first meeting for those who have received the Lord s redemption is the table meeting.
[97]  Eating the Lord s supper emphasizes our remembrance of the Lord through eating His bread and drinking of His cup.
[98]  CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE READING THE BIBLE THE ORIGIN OF THE BIBLE
[99]  The Bible is not something that comes from man s ideas or thoughts; rather, the Bible contains the thoughts and words of God, which were breathed into men through His Spirit and then written down.
[100]  Men spoke from God while being borne by the Holy Spirit 2 Pet 1:21 .
[101]  Since the Bible is the word of God breathed out through His Spirit, the words in the Bible do not represent the ideas of man.
[102]  Those who wrote the Bible were inspired by and under the power of the Holy Spirit; they were blown and borne by the Holy Spirit to express the word of God.
[103]  The Lord s word in verse 31, therefore, proves that the words of the Old Testament were spoken by God and originated from God, even though they were written by prophets.
[104]  The New Testament is the word spoken by God in the Lord Jesus John 14:10 and the word declared by the Holy Spirit and then written by the apostles 1 Cor 2:13 .
[105]  After being regenerated by the word of God, the Bible teaches, convicts, corrects, and instructs us in righteousness so that we may be complete before God as regenerated men of God.
[106]  If we want to be strong and living before God, we cannot live on bread alone; we need the word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, which is the word of the Bible.
[107]  The Holy Spirit in coordination with the Lord s life in us frequently enlivens us with a word or sentence in the Bible in order to remove things of the old creation so that we can grow in the new creation.
[108]  Whether it is speaking concerning God or man, the origin of the heavens and earth or the end of all things, the meaning of human life or the way of man, the things in this life or in the coming age, the Bible clearly explains every matter related to man.
[109]  If we do not have a sense that the Bible is precious and desirable, sweet and lovely, and if the word of the Bible is not more precious than gold in our heart and sweeter than honey in our mouth, we have not tasted the Bible.
[110]  If we do not have an appreciation of the value of the Bible, I hope that we will ask God for the grace to know the preciousness and sweetness of His Word, the Bible.
[111]  Many can testify that the best way to read the Bible is to read it daily.
[112]  Since the Bible is closely related to our living and actions, we need it in every area of our life.
[113]  Revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God 1 Cor 2:10 .
[114]  Even though the Bible has been revealed through the Holy Spirit, there are yet many deep and mysterious things of God in the Bible that only the Spirit can search out and reveal to us.
[115]  No one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.
[116]  Therefore, if we want to read the Bible and understand it, we must seek the Spirit s enlightenment.
[117]  We need the Holy Spirit s revelation so that we can understand the Bible.
[118]  Therefore, when we read the Bible, we should not depend on our intelligence but seek the enlightenment and revelation of the Holy Spirit.
[119]  Furthermore, if we want to understand the Bible, we need to do more than seek the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit; we also need to live in the Holy Spirit and become a spiritual person.
[120]  If our heart is not turned to the Lord, it will be difficult for us to understand the Bible and see its light; there will be a veil on our heart that prevents us from seeing the light in the Bible.
[121]  If we want to know the Bible, we must turn our heart to the Lord; that is, we must turn away from every person, thing, and matter outside of the Lord and return to the Lord.
[122]  Meditates by day and by night ; Muse upon ; Consider Psa 1:2; 119:15, 95; see also Matt 9:13 .
[123]  When we read the Bible, we need to meditate and consider.
[124]  Before we read the Bible, we should pray and ask the Lord to cleanse us, to open the eyes of our heart, to prepare our spirit, and to open His Word and shine His light upon it to reveal His truth in it by the Spirit.
[125]  After we finish reading, we need to continue to pray, asking the Lord to preserve what we have understood so that we might keep it in faith and love and to give us strength and grace so that we might practice what we have seen.
[126]  This kind of praying and reading, that is, pray-reading, enables us to not only understand the true spiritual meaning of the Bible the will of God but also to enjoy the reality of the content of the Bible God Himself.
[127]  A few points of explanation will help the brothers and sisters in their reading of the Bible.
[128]  For example, the history of Sarah and Hagar speaks of the difference between the old and new covenants Gen 21:1-14; Gal 4:22-31 , and the story of Mephibosheth describes God s salvation 2 Sam 9:1-13 .
[129]  We also must discern the different people in the Bible.
[130]  We cannot apply the word that was spoken to the Jews to the Gentiles or to the church.
[131]  Prayer, like reading the Bible, is a practice that Christians should not lack.
[132]  In a Christian s spiritual life reading the Bible is like eating, and praying is like breathing.
[133]  If a Christian does not pray, his spiritual life will be deadened, and he will not be living and strong.
[134]  We must ask the Lord to teach us to pray because none of us can pray.
[135]  When we come to the Lord, we should not pray according to our own determination or idea or according to our own heart or tendency.
[136]  We should place ourselves before the Lord and quietly wait for the Lord through His Spirit to teach us how to pray.
[137]  While we wait, the Spirit will lead us and give us an inward sense about how we should pray and the content of our prayer.
[138]  When our inward sense is according to the Spirit s leading, our prayer will be according to the Lord s teaching and leading.
[139]  Therefore, praying in the Lord s name means that in the matter of prayer, we are one with the Lord; the Lord s affairs are our affairs, and our affairs are the Lord s affairs.
[140]  If we pray according to the feeling of our deepest inward part, we will also pray in the Holy Spirit and by the Holy Spirit.
[141]  GOD S ANSWER TO PRAYER God Promises to Answer Our Prayer
[142]  Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find Luke 11:9 .
[143]  If we ask, the Lord promised that it shall be given to us.
[144]  Therefore, our prayers are answered, not because we cry until the Lord softens His heart and responds.
[145]  Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son John 14:13 .
[146]  God s goal in answering our prayers is not our pleasure or joy.
[147]  If we live in sin, our prayer surely cannot reach God, be heard by God, or be answered by God.
[148]  In like manner, wives, be subject to your own husbands...Husbands, in like manner dwell together with them according to knowledge...that your prayers may not be hindered 1 Pet 3:1, 7 .
[149]  If we do not listen to the word of God s command, or if we hate the word of God s command, He will not hear our prayer to Him.
[150]  We should ask the Lord to direct our hearts into the love of God and into the endurance of Christ so that we would have the love of God and the endurance of Christ.
[151]  We should ask God to grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith, that we may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints the breadth and length and height and depth, having tasted His love and being rooted and grounded in love, and that we may know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ in order to be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[152]  We need spiritual wisdom and understanding to know the will of God so that we can walk worthily of the Lord to please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work and growing by the full knowledge of God, being empowered with all power according to the might of His glory unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy.
[153]  To pray for the saints is to pray that the saints would know God s plan for the church in Christ as recorded in Ephesians, to know the salvation that God gave the church through Christ, and to grow up and mature by this knowledge to the fullness of the stature of Christ so that we can express Christ and deal with the enemy, Satan.
[154]  In this chapter we will briefly cover eight matters and four principles concerning the living of the believers.
[155]  His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is like this, it is not profitable to marry.
[156]  And He said to them, Not all men can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given...There are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens.
[157]  Although God ordained marriage for His common goal in creation, He gives some people the gift not to marry for the sake of His goal in His redemption.
[158]  To the married...a wife must not be separated from her husband but if indeed she is separated, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband , and a husband must not leave his wife...But if the unbelieving one separates, let him separate 1 Cor 7:10-11, 15 .
[159]  Therefore, whenever we see a marriage, we should be reminded of our relationship to Christ and of Christ s relationship to us.
[160]  When John the Baptist introduced the Lord Jesus, he said that the Lord was not only the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world but also the Bridegroom who would marry the bride.
[161]  Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ Eph 6:5; see also Col 3:22-25 .
[162]  In our households there might be a relationship between master and servants, so the Bible has a specific teaching regarding this matter.
[163]  They should not only serve and honor their master before his face but do everything for their master as to the Lord, as if they are serving the Lord, not man.
[164]  Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers 2 Cor 6:14; see also Deut 22:10; 2 Chron 20:35-37 .
[165]  Believers may not form business partnerships with unbelievers because God s Word says that believers should not be dissimilarly yoked.
[166]  Just as God does not allow an ox and a donkey to be yoked together to plow the field, He does not allow a believer to form business partnerships with unbelievers.
[167]  Since the dispositions, interests, and human goals of a believer and an unbeliever are completely different, it is difficult for a believer to practice the will of God and avoid being contaminated and affected by such a dissimilar relationship, causing him to offend God and withdraw from God.
[168]  Every herb that produces seed...and every tree which has fruit that produces seed Gen 1:29 .
[169]  Before the fall God ordained that man eat herbs and the fruit of trees.
[170]  Teachings of demons...abstaining from foods, which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth 1 Tim 4:1-3 .
[171]  The Word of God, however, tells us that these things have been recovered in God s eyes through the redemption of Christ and that He has given them to us.
[172]  I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst ; The bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world ; He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life ; If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink ; Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever John 6:35, 51, 54; 7:37; 4:14 .
[173]  Women adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing ; Let your adorning not be the outward plaiting of hair and putting on of gold or clothing with garments, but the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit 1 Tim 2:9; 1 Pet 3:3-5; see also Gen 35:4; Exo 33:5-6; Isa 3:16-25 .
[174]  The verses from 1 Timothy and 1 Peter clearly show that in the dispensation of grace, God wants us to pay attention to inward spiritual virtues rather than outward beauty and costly ornamentation.
[175]  While God does not give specific instructions on how to dress, two principles are presented: our clothing must be proper, and our clothing must not be extravagant.
[176]  The Lord Jesus said that we cannot serve God and mammon, which is money.
[177]  The Lord s word shows that money stands in a position that is against God.
[178]  In the Lord s eyes our faithfulness in the matter of making friends with the mammon of unrighteousness is the least of things v. 10 . This is because the earthly mammon of unrighteousness is an empty thing; it does not represent that which is true v. 11 . Rather, it belongs to another, to fallen, earthly men; it is not what is our own v. 12 . If we are faithful in this matter today, the Lord will give us great matters related to the kingdom, entrusting us with the heavenly, true matters.
[179]  CONCERNING AUTHORITY OVER US The Origin of Authority over Us
[180]  All authority is from God, and those that exist are ordained by God.
[181]  In such cases those who fear God cannot obey their command and offend God, even though they should be subject to the authority from God.
