   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN CLOTHING AND FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We will now talk about clothing and food as they pertain to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we will speak about clothing for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. CLOTHING A. The Significance of Clothing</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, let us consider the meaning of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to understand the need for clothing, we must go back to the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Clothing Not Needed before the Fall</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before man fell into sin, his clothing, perhaps, was a mere form of light around him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was innocent, and he had no feeling of shame before the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although he did not wear anything, he was not ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Clothing Needed</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>to Cover Man s Shame after the Fall</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When sin came in, the first effect on man was the realization of his own nakedness; he felt ashamed immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Adam and Eve made aprons of fig leaves and put them on.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shows us the basic significance of clothing; it is for covering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Clothing is necessary because we need to cover ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a pity that the aprons of fig leaves did not last.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The leaves soon dried up, broke into pieces, and disintegrated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God then clothed man with animal skins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He prepared something solid and lasting for man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The purpose of this clothing was to cover the body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, clothes are for covering the body; they are not for exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Any clothes which do not serve the simple purpose of covering the body are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Clothing is for covering the body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Blood Being Needed for Exposed Areas</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Israelites wore sandals in the land of Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They did not have socks, and their feet were exposed to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The rest of their body was covered with clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Other than their hands, feet, and head, their whole body was covered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the priests went before God with the blood, the blood was applied to the thumb of the hand, the toe of the foot, and the ear.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shows us that the exposed areas had to be covered by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The blood was not applied to the other parts of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The hands, feet, and head were the only areas which needed the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The other areas were covered by clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows us that the purpose of clothing is for covering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must realize before God that it is proper for man to be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today s degradation can be traced to man s degeneration to his uncivilized state.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In such a state he clothes himself scantily.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is improper for man to be scantily clothed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Clothing is for covering, and any clothing that is not for covering violates God s definition of a covering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The blood is a type.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Its spiritual significance points to the need of covering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man has sinned and needs covering before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today any shortening of sleeves or hems, or any clothing which exhibits rather than covers the body, is of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God is not pleased with such clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In view of this, the more covering a garment affords, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am a sinner, and my need is to be completely covered before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I do not want any part of my being to be exposed before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are Christians who are saved and who have put our trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we have no standing before the Lord unless we are fully covered by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We look for covering and pray that our whole being would be fully covered by Him so that every part of our being would be redeemed and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to the type in the Scripture, whatever is not covered by one s clothing must be covered by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our hands, feet, and head must all be under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Man s Second Fall Due to Nakedness</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When Adam and Eve sinned, their nakedness exposed their sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Noah came out of the ark 1,656 years later.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He planted a vineyard and became drunk.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As a result, he took off his clothes and exposed himself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The first man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and found himself naked.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The next man found himself naked after eating the fruit of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The second fall of man came when he did not put on the clothing he was supposed to put on.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Adam fell from a state where he needed no clothing to a state where he needed clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Noah fell when he had clothing but did not put it on.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the Bible nakedness is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is something forbidden by the Scripture.</S>
