[2]  The Lord as an apostle was unique, and the twelve, as apostles, were also unique; but neither the Apostle nor the twelve apostles could abide on earth forever.
[3]  Since the meaning of the word "apostle" is "the sent one," the meaning of apostleship is quite plain, that is, the office of the sent one.
[4]  Shepherding and teaching may be regarded as one ministry, because those who teach must also shepherd, and those who shepherd must also teach.
[5]  It is important to note that apostleship is an office, not a gift.
[6]  An office is what one receives as the result of a commission; a gift is what one receives on the basis of grace.
[7]  The sphere of an apostle's work is quite different from that of the other three special ministers.
[8]  That prophets and teachers exercise their gifts in the local church is seen from the statement: "Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers."
[9]  You can find prophets and teachers in the local church, but not apostles, because they have been called to minister in different places, while the ministry of prophets and teachers is confined to one locality 1 Cor 14:26, 29 .
[10]  CHAPTER TWO THE SEPARATION AND MOVEMENTS OF THE APOSTLES ANTIOCH THE MODEL CHURCH
[11]  The church in Antioch is the model church shown us in God's Word, because it was the first to come into being after the founding of the churches connected with the Jews and the Gentiles.
[12]  In Acts 2 we see the church in connection with the Jews established in Jerusalem, and in chapter ten we see the church in connection with the Gentiles established in the house of Cornelius.
[13]  It was to the divine call they responded, not to the call of human need.
[14]  They had heard no reports of man-eaters or head-hunting savages; their compassions had not been stirred by doleful tales of child-marriage or foot-binding or opium- smoking.
[15]  Yes, it was the Holy Spirit who called Barnabas and Saul, but He said to the other prophets and teachers as well as to them, "Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
[16]  On what ground did these prophets and teachers set certain men apart as apostles, and whom did these prophets and teachers represent?
[17]  That churches are the local expression of the Body of Christ is an established fact, so we need not go into that here; but some explanation is called for regarding the gifted ministers whom God has set in the Church as the expression of the ministry of the Body.
[18]  In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul is clearly dealing with the question of Christian service.
[19]  As we have seen, the laying on of hands speaks of oneness Lev 1:4 , and the only oneness known among the children of God is the oneness of the Body of Christ; therefore, in laying hands upon the apostles, the prophets and teachers definitely stood on the ground of the Body, acting as its representative members.
[20]  Their action identified the whole church with the apostles, and identified the apostles with the whole church.
[21]  These prophets and teachers did not stand on individual ground to send the apostles forth as their personal representatives, nor did they stand on the ground of any select company to send them out as representatives of that particular company; but they stood on the ground of the Body, as its ministering members, and set these two apart for the work of the gospel.
[22]  After the apostles were called by the Spirit and were separated for the work by the representative members of the Body, what did they do?
[23]  What effect had this early departure of the apostles upon the infant church?
[24]  Here was a group of new believers, mere babes in Christ, and their fathers in the faith forsook them in their infancy.
[25]  The Word of God makes it clear that the oversight of a church is not the work of apostles, but of elders.
[26]  Although Paul stayed in Corinth for over a year, in Rome for two years, and in Ephesus for three years, yet in none of these places did he assume responsibility for the work of the local church.
[27]  Elders were local men appointed to oversee affairs in the local church.
[28]  It is the responsibility of every saved man to serve the Lord according to his capacity and in his own sphere.
[29]  CHAPTER FOUR THE CHURCHES FOUNDED BY THE APOSTLES THE CHURCH AND THE CHURCHES
[30]  In the Word of God we find "the church of God" spoken of in the singular 1 Cor 10:32 , but we find the same Word referring to the "churches of God" in the plural 1 Thes 2:14 .
[31]  Throughout the Word of God we can find no name attached to a church save the name of a place, for example, the church in Jerusalem, the church in Lystra, the church in Derbe, the church in Colosse, the church in Troas, the church in Thessalonica, the church in Antioch.
[32]  We have seen that all the churches in Scripture are local churches, but the question naturally arises, What is a scriptural locality?
[33]  If we note what places are mentioned in God's Word in connection with the founding of churches, then we shall be able to determine what the extent of a place must be to justify its being regarded as a unit for the forming of a church.
[34]  We read in 1 Corinthians 1:2 of "the church of God which is in Corinth."
[35]  We have just seen that the boundary of a church cannot be narrower than the locality to which it belongs.
[36]  It was never God's purpose that a number of churches in different places should be combined under any denomination or organization, but rather that each one should be independent of the other.
[37]  When our Lord sent messages to His children in Asia, He did not address them as "the church in Asia," but "the seven churches which are in Asia."
[38]  Since there is a spiritual relatedness between the various local churches, no one church may strike out on an individualistic line, and taking advantage of its independence, decide things after its own good pleasure.
[39]  HOW TO PRESERVE THE LOCAL CHARACTER OF THE CHURCHES
[40]  Since the churches of God are local, we must be careful to preserve their local character, their local sphere, and their local boundary.
[41]  Once a church loses these, it ceases to be a scriptural church.
[42]  The reason God does not sanction the establishing of churches which combine companies of believers in different places is that the divinely-ordained basis for the forming of churches is thereby destroyed.
[43]  Any "church" formed with a mission as its center is bound to be other than local, because wherever there is a center, there is also a sphere; and if the center of the church is a mission, then obviously its sphere is not the scriptural sphere of locality but the sphere of the mission.
[44]  Whenever a special leader, or a specific doctrine, or some experience, or creed, or organization, becomes a center for drawing together the believers of different places, then because the center of such a church federation is other than Christ, it follows that its sphere will be other than local.
[45]  CHAPTER FIVE THE BASIS OF UNION AND DIVISION THE FORMING OF LOCAL CHURCHES
[46]  In the previous chapter we observed that the word "church" was only mentioned twice in the Gospels.
[47]  It is used frequently in the Acts, but we are never explicitly told there how a church was formed.
[48]  In any place where the gospel has been proclaimed and people have believed on the Lord, they are the church in that place, and they are our brethren.
[49]  But things are not so simple in our days, for the question has been complicated by many so-called churches that exclude those who should be in the church, and include those who should be outside.
[50]  Before we proceed to discover who really belongs to a local church and who does not, let us first inquire who belongs to the universal Church and who does not, since the condition of membership in a church is essentially the same as in the Church.
[51]  "One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all" Eph 4:4-6 .
[52]  There are various forms of baptism accepted by the children of God, so if we make the form of baptism the dividing line between those who belong to the church and those who do not, we shall exclude many true believers from our fellowship.
[53]  There are children of God who even believe that a material baptism is not necessary, but since they are the children of God, we dare not on that account exclude them from our fellowship.
[54]  Now what is true of the universal Church is also true of a local church.
[55]  Here Paul points out the carnality of the Corinthian believers in attempting to divide the church of God in Corinth, which, by the divine ordering, was indivisible, being already the smallest scriptural unit upon which any church could be established.
[56]  Cephas was a zealous minister of the gospel, Paul was a man who had suffered much for his Lord's sake, and Apollos was one whom God certainly used in His service, but though all three had been indisputably owned of God in Corinth, God could never permit the church there to make them a ground of division.
[57]  Some Christians think they know better than to say, "I am of Cephas," or "I am of Paul," or "I am of Apollos."
[58]  All believers living in the same locality belong to the same church.
[59]  If we make undenominationalism or unsectarianism the boundary of our church, instead of locality, then we lose our local standing as a church and become a sect.
[60]  In the Greek the word rendered "heresies" in Galatians 5:20 KJV does not necessarily convey the thought of error, but rather of division on the ground of doctrine.
[61]  Though some may be right and others wrong, God does not sanction any division on account of difference as to such beliefs.1 If a group of believers split off from a local church in their zeal for certain teaching according to the Word of God, the new "church" they establish may have more scriptural teaching, but it could never be a scriptural church.
[62]  Should we arrive at a place where a church has already been established on clear local ground, and discover that its members hold views which we consider unscriptural, or that they consider the views we hold as unscriptural, if we then refuse to recognize them as the church of God in that locality and withdraw from fellowship, we are divisive.
[63]  Romans 14 shows us how to deal with those whose views differ from ours.
[64]  Why, we should consider it almost intolerable if in the same church some of the believers kept the Lord's Day and others the Sabbath, and some ate meat freely, while others were strict vegetarians.
[65]  "Now him who is weak in faith receive, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his considerations" v. 1 . "Who are you who judge another's household servant? To his own master he stands or falls; and he will be made to stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand" v. 4 . "Therefore let us judge one another no longer, but rather judge this: not to put a stumbling block or cause of falling before your brother" v. 13 . Oh, for Christian tolerance! Oh, for largeness of heart! Alas! that many of God's children are so zealous for their pet doctrines that they immediately label as heretics, and treat accordingly, all whose interpretation of Scripture differs from theirs.
[66]  Jews and Gentiles represent national as well as racial distinctions, but in the Church of God there is neither Jew nor Greek.
[67]  In Paul's day, from a social point of view, there was a great gulf fixed between a free man and a slave; yet they worshipped side by side in the same church.
[68]  In our day, if a rickshaw coolie and the president of our republic both belong to Christ and live in the same place, then they belong to the same church.
[69]  In regard to the universal Church, God first brought it into being, and thereafter set apostles to minister to it 1 Cor 12:28 ; but in regard to the local churches the order was quite otherwise.
[70]  Just as the apostles have spiritual but no official responsibility regarding the church, so the elders, and the whole church, have spiritual but no official responsibility regarding the work.
[71]  It is commendable if a local church seeks to help in the work; but it is under no official obligation to do so.
[72]  If the members of the church are spiritual, they cannot but regard the work of God as their work, in which case they will count it a joy to help in any way.
[73]  The church in Rome is a good illustration of the foregoing.
[74]  When he actually reached Rome, the church there did not hand over local responsibility to him, nor did they say as a church today probably would , "Now that an apostle has come into our midst, he must take over the responsibility and be our pastor."
[75]  The principle of Paul living in his own rented house shows clearly that the work of the church is unaffected by the presence or absence of an apostle.
[76]  After Paul's arrival in Rome, the work of the church went on as before, independently of him.
[77]  Work is work, and church is church, and these two lines never converge, but keep running parallel one to the other.
[78]  When a servant of God reaches a new place, his first business must be to found a local church, unless there is one already in existence, in which case his one concern must be to help the church.
[79]  All God's servants are engaged in the ministry of building up the Body of Christ, but it does not follow that, because all are in the ministry of the Word, all ministries are the same.
[80]  All such ministry is new and specific and is of great value to the Church; but we must bear it well in mind that if God commits a specific ministry to any man relating to certain truths, he must not make his particular ministry, or his particular line of truth, the basis of a new "church."
[81]  It must not be inferred from the foregoing that God has no other workmen but apostles and the various ministers of the Word.
[82]  Before considering the question of spiritual authority, let us read a few passages of Scripture bearing on the relationship between the workers, as they throw considerable light on our subject.
[83]  But in divinely constituted companies of workers there is no organization.
[84]  Authority is exercised among them, but such authority is spiritual, not official.
[85]  The sphere of the work, unlike the sphere of the local church, is very wide.
[86]  We see here not the movements of the local church but of the work, for the movements of the local church are always confined to one locality.
[87]  To one company God gives one kind of ministry, and to another an altogether different form of ministry.
[88]  Conditions have greatly changed since the days of the early apostles.
[89]  Despite that fact, our work today is still the same as in the days of the early apostles to found and build up local churches, the local expressions of the Body of Christ.
[90]  So if we are in a place where there is no church, we should seek the Lord's face that He may enable us to win souls for Himself and form them into a local church.
[91]  If we are in a place where there are missions, or churches, standing on sectarian or denominational ground, but no church standing on the ground of the Body and the locality, then our duty is just the same, that is, to found and build a local church.
[92]  Here is the most important principle in the work of God a worker must not seek to establish a branch of the church from which he goes out, but to establish a church in the locality to which he comes.
[93]  It is a remarkable fact that, while the book of Acts supplies many minute details regarding the work of an apostle, the one subject which from a human standpoint is of paramount importance in the carrying on of any work is not dealt with at all.
[94]  Faith is a most important factor in God's service, for without it there can be no truly spiritual work; but our faith requires training and strengthening, and material needs are a means used in God's hand toward that end.
[95]  We may profess to have faith in God for a vast variety of intangible things, and we may deceive ourselves into believing we really trust Him when we have no trust at all, simply because there is nothing concrete to demonstrate our distrust.
[96]  If we cannot trust God to supply our temporal needs, then we cannot trust Him to supply our spiritual needs; but if we truly prove His trustworthiness in the very practical realm of material wants, we shall be able also to trust Him when spiritual difficulties arise either in connection with the work or with our personal lives.
[97]  Our Lord said, "The worker is worthy of his wages" Luke 10:7 ; and Paul wrote to the Corinthians, "So also the Lord directed those who announce the gospel to live from the gospel" 1 Cor 9:14 .
[98]  It does not mean that God's servant should receive a definite allowance from the church, for the modern system of paid service in the work of God was unknown in Paul's day.
[99]  It is not permissible to receive a definite salary from a church, and at times it is not even permissible to receive an indefinite gift.
[100]  All the servants of God must not only trust Him entirely for the supply of their needs, but when gifts are freely offered them, they must be able to discern clearly whether or not such gifts could be received by God.
[101]  That was a great and noble statement that our brother Paul made to the Philippians.
[102]  He dared to say to those who were almost his sole supporters, "I have received in full all things and abound."
[103]  We are the representatives of God in this world, and we are here to prove His faithfulness; therefore, above all in financial matters we must be totally independent of men, and wholly dependent upon God.
[104]  Our attitude, our words, and our actions must all declare that He alone is our source of supply.
[105]  Let us be clear that we must not only bear the burden of our own personal needs, but of the needs of the work as well.
[106]  In the Old Testament we read that though the Levites stood in the place of God to receive tithes from all His people, they themselves offered tithes to Him.
[107]  Some have asked, "Since you believe all God's servants should trust Him for their daily needs, and since you have quite a company of fellow workers, why do you not become an organized faith mission?"
[108]  Having already observed the difference between the work and the churches, between the apostles and the elders, between the basis of a scriptural church and sects, we can now proceed to see how a local church is organized.
[109]  According to the present-day conception, three things are regarded as essential to the existence of a church, apart from the group of Christians who constitute its members.
[110]  When a church is founded, the believers from the very outset must learn to meet by themselves, either in their own homes or in some other building which they are able to secure.
[111]  Before we consider the question of meeting, let us first say a few words concerning the nature of the Church.
[112]  The second kind of meeting is mentioned in the first Epistle to the Corinthians:
[113]  If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak in tongues, and some unlearned in tongues or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are insane?
[114]  Further, to maintain the Sunday morning preaching, you must have a good preacher.
[115]  Therefore, a worker is not only needed to manage church affairs, but also to maintain the meetings for spiritual uplift.
[116]  In 1 Corinthians 14, where a church meeting is in view, apostles have been left out of account altogether!
[117]  When the members of a church assemble and the spiritual gifts are in use, prophecy and other gifts are exercised, but there is no mention of apostles for the simple reason that apostles are appointed no place in the meetings of the local church; they are appointed to the work.
[118]  In the earlier chapters of this book we have already seen what the ministry, the work, and the local churches are.
[119]  In this chapter we have seen the connection between the ministry and the local church, and also the difference between the church and the work.
[120]  In Acts 13 we saw that God had established one of His churches in a certain locality; then He gave gifts to a few individuals in that church to equip them to minister there as prophets and teachers, so that the church might be built up.
[121]  Thus, in the ministry we have the prophets and other ministers using their gifts to serve the local church, while the apostles, by their office and gifts, serve all the churches.
[122]  The ministry of these two groups of men is of great importance, because all the work of God local and extra-local is in their hands.
[123]  And in the offices instituted by God, we have the elders occupying the chief place in the local church, while apostles hold no office at all there.
[124]  Apostles hold the highest office in the work, but in the local church they as apostles hold no office at all; elders, on the other hand, hold the chief office in the local church, but as elders they have no place in the work.
