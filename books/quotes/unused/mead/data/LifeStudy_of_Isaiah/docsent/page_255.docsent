   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. Growing Up like a Tender Plant before Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Apparently, Isaiah 53 says nothing about incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, the first part of verse 2 says, "For He grew up like a tender plant before Him, / And like a root out of dry ground."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament economy, it was unveiled and reported concerning Christ that He was like a tender plant, like a root out of dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This certainly is a reference to Christ's incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Just these few words indicate that Christ is the incarnated One.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As such a One, He grew up before God like a tender plant.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Having No Attracting Form nor Majesty</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second part of verse 2 says, "He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, / Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Very few people would pay any particular attention to a tender plant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In one sense, the Lord Jesus is beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are a number of hymns in our hymnal concerning His beauty Hymns, #170-178 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, in another sense, Jesus is not beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has no beautiful appearance that we should desire Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Having Been Despised and Forsaken of Men,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>a Man of Sorrows and Acquainted with Grief</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 3 says, "He was despised and forsaken of men, / A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; / And like one from whom men hide their faces, / He was despised; and we did not esteem Him."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the account in the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus was continually despised, was forsaken of men, and was a man of sorrows who knew nothing but grief.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, He was like one from whom men hide their faces.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Men did not like to see Him, and they did not esteem or regard Him Matt 13:54-57 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Based on this account we would not consider such a One as a great man, nor would we consider ourselves inferior to such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the Crucified Redeemer, Sacrificing Himself for Our Trespasses for the Accomplishing</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>of Jehovah's Eternal Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, in the report of the prophets and the revelation of Jehovah, Christ was revealed as the crucified Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As our Redeemer, Christ sacrificed Himself for our trespasses, or, for our sin, for the accomplishing of Jehovah's eternal redemption Isa 53:4-10a .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is difficult to understand how one who is great could be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who are crucified are usually very low and mean.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, our Redeemer was crucified, sacrificing Himself for our trespasses for the accomplishing of God's eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these things concerning Christ are revealed in a heavenly language.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we call this the gospel, the glad tidings, the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, however, according to our natural human thought, we might wonder how such words could be considered as glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When they go out to tell people about Jesus, many Christians do not speak of Jesus in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They dare not tell people that Jesus was a tender plant, that He was like a root out of dry ground, and that He has no beauty, attracting form, or majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps you have never told people that your Jesus was like a tender plant growing up before God and that He was like a root out of dry ground, growing with difficulty because there was no water.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We prefer to know Christ and to present Christ as a great person in the Old Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, we need the Lord's grace to bring us into the New Testament economy.</S>
