   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROMISES OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Besides the nine points covered already, there is still another point.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of the nine points that have been covered, none can be overthrown by you, or even by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No method or way can overthrow them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once a person is saved through God's grace, no longer can anyone cast him away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the Lord Jesus considered this as not good enough; He was concerned that we would doubt His work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, He gave us promises to purposely show us that we will not be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all remember John 10.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This portion of the Scripture shows us clearly what our destiny hinges on.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our destiny does not hinge on ourselves; rather, it hinges on the Lord Jesus and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 10:28-30 says, "And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I and the Father are one."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word of the Lord here cannot be clearer: "And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These words alone are adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here the Lord speaks in such a solemn and definite way that we shall "by no means perish forever."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is just like saying that we shall not be cast away forever, as mentioned earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is also like saying that we will not come into judgment, but have passed out of death into life, as mentioned in John 5:24.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are all absolute words: "And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is an eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who do not know God do not know what God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a man knows God, he knows that whatever God does is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God does not ever do anything temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God never changes from one time to the next.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What God has done is done once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God will not change after two days.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once God has done something, it is done forever.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God will not save you today and cast you into hell tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He will not save you again the following day and cast you into hell again the day after that.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If that were the case, the book of life would not look very nice; there would be deletions and corrections here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What He gives to us is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That is why we can never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to see that whatever God does is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God will never change after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man can change at will, but God cannot change at will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once He saves us, we are saved eternally; never again could we be in danger of perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What proof do we have of this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"No one shall snatch them out of My hand."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The words "no one" in the original text have the meaning of "not any created thing."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord says that none of the created things can snatch us out of His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"I am a good shepherd; I gave life to My sheep, and My sheep shall never perish."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the Father has given the Lord the sheep, no created thing can snatch them out of the Father's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John 10:28 speaks of the Lord's shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 29 makes a turn and mentions the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 29 says, "My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The hand mentioned in verse 28 is the Shepherd's hand, and the hand mentioned in verse 29 is the Father's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Who is the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He says that the Father is greater than all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All things are included in this "all."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the created things, all the angels, all the evil spirits, all the human beings, all the created things in the world, including you and me, are included in this "all."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord says that the Father is greater than all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No one can snatch us from His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He has a big hand that keeps His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How can they ever be lost again?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only one that is greater than the One who is greater than all could possibly snatch us away.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some may say, "True, others cannot snatch us away, but I myself can go out."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For one to say this proves that his mind is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He does not know God's Word, and he does not know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After a person is saved, if he were to perish, would it be because he himself wants to perish?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Or would it be because of the temptation of the world, the seduction of the enemy, and the attack of Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For a Christian to perish would mean that lust can snatch man from God's hand; it would mean that the devil and the world can snatch man from God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Man does not go to hell because he wants to go to hell; even sinners themselves do not want to go to hell, not to mention Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is clear that man is dead in sin because of the evil spirits' binding work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Everyone in the world is possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All the sinners have demons working in them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the believers can be snatched from the Father's hand, then the evil spirits are greater than the Father of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Here is a sheep in the hand of the Father of all.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If nothing is greater than the Father of all, there is no possibility that this sheep can be snatched away.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Moreover, it is impossible even for us to escape ourselves, because even we are part of the all things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord Jesus said, "My Father is greater than all."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You cannot put yourself outside of the all things.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thank God that verse 28 shows us the hand of the Lord Jesus and verse 29 shows us the hand of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verse 28 tells us about the hand of the Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is not a matter of law, nor a matter of curse, nor a matter of mercy, but a matter of the keeping by the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Verse 29 says that the Father's hand is greater and more powerful than all.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should consider ourselves securely held by two hands: the Father's hand and the Shepherd's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Not long after I believed in the Lord, Brother Leland Wang and I went to listen to a message in Jiang Wan.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The preacher said that we Christians should be fervent.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should preach the gospel and serve the Lord; otherwise, we would be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After the message, I asked Brother Wang, "When do you think you will be dropped?"</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He said, "I am afraid that I will be dropped tonight."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I said, "Yes, I am afraid that I will also be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If I am dropped, I will go to hell."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I further said, "If we can be dropped, what is the use of exhorting people to believe in Jesus any longer?"</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He agreed, saying, "I cannot even eat tonight."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I said that not only would we not be able to eat, but we would not even be able to sleep that night.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Those in the world do not know the danger of eternal death; they can still eat and sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We know the peril of eternal death; we know that we are like chaff before the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>How can we not worry?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This was my story before I knew about this aspect of the truth.</S>
