   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN GOD'S DESIRE FOR MAN TO SUBMIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO DEPUTY AUTHORITY Date: June 26, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Kuling Mountain REBELLION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>BEING THE GREATEST SIN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today we will continue with the subject of God's authority in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Numbers 16 records two instances of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen the first rebellion, which covers verses 1 through 40.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was the rebellion of the leaders among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their end was the way of Sheol; they went straight down to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's people should overcome the gates of Hades, but these ones were overcome by the gates of Hades instead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From verse 41 to the end of the chapter is the second rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was the rebellion of the entire congregation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 41 the congregation murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying, "You have killed the people of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The spirit of rebellion is infectious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even when a person witnesses judgment on others, he may not stop the rebellion in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The people did not take warning from the result of the rebellion of the two hundred fifty leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the contrary, when the rebellious ones were judged and sent to Hades, the whole congregation rose up in rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They forgot that the gates of Hades opened up the first time because of the leaders' own folly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They forgot that it was not Moses and Aaron who had judged the two hundred fifty leaders, but God who had judged them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moses and Aaron did not open the gates of Hades; God opened them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The congregation only saw men; they did not realize that authority comes from God, and they attacked boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the entire congregation was attacking Moses and Aaron, God stepped forward and vindicated Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He showed that authority comes from Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In reality, the people were not opposing Moses and Aaron; they were opposing God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moses and Aaron saw the rebellion of the congregation, but they did not open their mouths to argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, God spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His glory was manifested in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His glory manifested itself not only in times of deliverance, but in times of judgment as well.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God told Moses and Aaron that He would destroy the entire congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As soon as a man begins to rebel, he moves his feet towards the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before Moses and Aaron spoke, God stepped in to deal with the people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's glory was manifested in the execution of His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God could tolerate the ten murmurings of the people in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He could tolerate their sin of reminiscing about Egypt or their lack of interest in entering Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These sins prevented them from entering Canaan directly through Kadesh-barnea and caused them to wander in the wilderness for thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, He could not tolerate their touching His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He would not tolerate them for another thirty-eight years but would destroy them in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The sin of rebellion is more serious than any other kind of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Israelites were already at the threshold of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If God would not let them go in, it would defeat the purpose of their exodus out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet God was willing to let the entire generation go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He could bear many sins and forgive many trespasses, but rebellion is the pathway to hell; it is in the principle of death and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This sin is more serious than any other sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the people were opposing God's authority, God spoke to Moses and Aaron, and after He spoke, a plague broke out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Within a few minutes 14,700 persons died.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What a sobering thing!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Fortunately, Moses had keen spiritual discernment; he ordered Aaron to take the censer, put fire in it from off the altar, place incense on it, and carry it to the assembly to make propitiation for them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This stopped the plague.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This shows us how serious it is to stand against authority!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>SAUL'S STUMBLING IN THE MATTER OF AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the children of Israel entered Canaan, they fell into confusion time after time during the period of the judges.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everyone did according to what was right in his own sight.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God was not able to set up His authority among the people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's authority was not found among them until the kingdom of Israel was established and the period of the kings began.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the Israelites came out of Egypt, the entire race experienced deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By the time of the kings, the authority of the kingdom was established.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Saul was the first king of the kingdom of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God chose him and made him the authority, that is, God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Later, Saul fell in the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God commanded him to destroy the Amalekites and everything they possessed, but Saul disobeyed God's command and had pity on Agag the king of Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was not willing to destroy the best of the sheep and the oxen of the Amalekites.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He did not hearken to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, Samuel said to him, "Does Jehovah delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices/As much as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?/Surely, to obey is better than sacrifice,/And to heed, than the fat of rams" 1 Sam 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He told Saul that God wanted obedience and submission from him, not the best of the sheep, oxen, and sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Saul was God's appointed authority, yet he did not keep his place as an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Saul was the greatest utilitarian in the Old Testament, and Judas was his counterpart in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Saul was the Old Testament pragmatist, and Judas was the New Testament pragmatist.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Saul was a little better than Judas; he spared things for the Lord, while Judas tried to save the money spent on the ointment for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet the principle of rebellion in both cases is the same.</S>
