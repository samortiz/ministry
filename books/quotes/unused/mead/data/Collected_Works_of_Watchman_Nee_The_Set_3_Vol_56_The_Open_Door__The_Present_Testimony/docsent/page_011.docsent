   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Six Villages Rongho</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We had a conference in Peizhuang of Rongho for seven days beginning on December 28, 1950.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We invited a total of fourteen brothers and sisters from Yitang of Linjin to come preach His gospel in one accord with us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The nature and general information concerning the meetings were as follows: There was a prayer meeting in the early morning, an edification meeting in the late morning, and preaching the gospel in the neighboring towns in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We went to six villages in seven evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Four hundred forty people repented and believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We hope that you will praise the Lord with us when you read this letter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We had a three-day conference in Rongho immediately following the seven-day conference.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God was very merciful and heard our pleas.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He established His testimony table with forty-one brothers and sisters who break bread together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We hope you also will offer up thanks and praise for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Pei Fu-min, Sun Wen-yuan, Hsueh Shao-yi, and Lin De-ching</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>January 8, 1951</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Back from Sian In a Fellowship Meeting One</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jeremiah 10:23 says, "I know, O Jehovah,/That a man's way is not in himself;/It is not in the man who walks/To direct his step."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We experienced this verse when we went out this time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to ourselves, we never planned to make this trip.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, a man's way is not in himself; it is not in the man who walks to direct his steps.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot direct anything; everything is God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We went out because the church in Sian had a need and invited us to help them solve a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before the Lord, we felt that this was very serious, and we earnestly prayed, "Lord, how do we handle this great matter?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lord, go with us, and may we bring Your blessing."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We prayed, but we did not have the assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Yu also said this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We went without the assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We left on June 29 and arrived in Hsuchow on the 30th.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We stayed there for three days and had a few meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We went to Chengchow on July 3.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We arrived in Sian on the 5th, which was a Thursday.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There was an edification meeting for new believers, and they wanted us to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Yu spoke something.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There was a fellowship meeting on Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We wanted to see their condition and had not planned to speak anything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, at the meeting time we were waiting for them, and they were waiting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then I was moved inwardly and felt that I should speak something about the attitude of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as I was about to stand up, Brother Yu stood up and spoke about "the attitude of the meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I marveled in my heart, for I had never had such a clear experience in my entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Yu spoke on the inward aspect, and after he had finished speaking, I continued to speak something about the outward aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The condition of the meeting that evening was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some of the brothers from Sian were able to testify.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From that evening, we began to believe that the Lord Himself would work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After two weeks of meeting, the difficulties had almost been resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the conference was almost over, Lanchow sent us a letter inviting us to come.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We did not make any decision.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We prayed before God that we would go if He would make the arrangements namely a car .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Just as the conference was over, some brothers from Lanchow drove two cars to fill with cargo, and they wanted us to ride back with them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We felt that it was God's arrangement, so we did not refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We left on August 4 and arrived in Pingliang on the fifth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There were meetings for two days.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We left Pingliang on the ninth and arrived in Lanchow on the tenth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There was a two-week conference in Lanchow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After the conference, we were preparing to return to Pingliang.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time, the church in Pingliang sent a brother and sister to bring us back, but we did not have the inward peace to return to Pingliang.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although many things would have been convenient if we returned to Pingliang, there was an inward forbidding.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After a few days, a telegram from Tiensui came inviting us to go there.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brother Yu asked me how I felt.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I said that outwardly I was not willing to go, but inwardly I felt that I would not have the peace if I did not go.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brother Yu said, "I have the same feeling."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, we could only set Pingliang aside and go to Tiensui.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We arrived in Tiensui on August 13.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There was a week-long conference here, and the Lord did a marvelous work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On September 10, we arrived in Mei County.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We had a one-week conference in Mei County, during which we met in a cave.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those brothers are very good and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After going to Mei County, the brothers in Pingyuan province earnestly invited us to go there.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We left Mei County to return to Sian on September 18.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the train Brother Yu told me that he knew something was going to happen that day.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is what happened.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As we were crossing a river, the donkeys we were riding fell and we fell off.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Fortunately, we fell on to the sand.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we arrived at the train station, we inwardly felt that it was not right to go to Pingyuan province because we had not thoroughly sought the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We could only tell them that we could not go to Pingyuan.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It seemed as though we had dumped a pan of cold water on them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But because we were forbidden inwardly, we could only return to Sian.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On September 25 we left Sian and arrived in Linjin on the twenty-eighth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There we had a one-week conference.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The meetings were very good.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We arrived in Zhenzhou on October 4.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We had not said that there would be a conference when we returned to Zhenzhou, but more than eighty brothers and sisters came from Pingyuan and Honan provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The meeting hall could only accommodate about ten people, so we really could not handle them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Since we could not have a conference in Zhenzhou, we had to ask them to go back.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We said that if anyone wanted to come to Hsuchow, they could go with us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We said that we could take twenty people at the most, because the meeting hall in Hsuchow was also small, and there was a problem with hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But to our surprise, the brothers in Hsuchow did a good job with the hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There was a one-week conference in Hsuchow.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then a telegram from Nanking invited us there, and some brothers from Tsinan came to invite us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Since Brother Yu had promised the brothers in Tsinan earlier that we would go there if we had the opportunity, we could not refuse, and we were not forbidden inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Therefore, we left Hsuchow on October 13 and arrived in Tsinan that afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>While we were in Tsinan, the church in Tsingtao also sent brothers to invite us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Outwardly, we were exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then we were dealt with before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If the Lord really wanted to go, we were willing to go.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When we put everything aside, we saw clearly that we were right in not going.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>As a result, the brothers who had come for us were willing to put everything aside as we had.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We left Tsinan on October 20 and arrived in Shanghai the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>On this trip we really saw that a man's way is not in himself and it is not in the man who walks to direct his steps.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Chu Chen</S>
