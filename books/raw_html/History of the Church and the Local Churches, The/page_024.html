<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. The Denominations</H2><P>The Lord also showed us the evils, the wrongdoings, of denominationalism. Christians have denominated themselves with many different names such as Lutheran, Wesleyan, Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc. These denominations are divisions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. The Clergy-laity System</H2><P>The Lord showed us how the clergy-laity system kills the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ. This system includes human organization with its hierarchy, rank, and position. In the Roman Catholic Church, there are the priests, the bishops, the archbishops, the cardinals, and the pope. In the Protestant churches, there are the pastors, and in the state churches there are the bishops and the heads of state. According to the revelation of the Scriptures, this system is an evil abomination in the eyes of God. Denominationalism cuts the Body into pieces, and the clergy-laity system kills the functions of the members of the Body. By these two things, the entire Body of Christ is brought to nothing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>6. The Universal Priesthood</H2><P>We spent much time to teach the believers that all of them were priests and that they could function in a priestly service to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>7. The Presbytery</H2><P>The church does not need any organization or any kind of human government or rule, but the church does need a proper presbytery. The presbytery is the eldership. Every local church needs a group of experienced brothers to be the leading ones, the overseers, taking the oversight of the church's activity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>8. The Proper Baptism and the Proper Lord's Table</H2><P>The Lord showed us the proper baptism, which is by being immersed into water. He also showed us the proper way to have His table.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>9. Head Covering and the Laying On of Hands</H2><P>The Lord showed Brother Nee the real meaning of head covering and the real practice of laying hands on the saints.</P>
