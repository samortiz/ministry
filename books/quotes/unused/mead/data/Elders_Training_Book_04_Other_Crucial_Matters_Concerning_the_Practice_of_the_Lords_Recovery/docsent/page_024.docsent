   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Every Church Being Part of the Lord's Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every church is worth seeing because they are the churches of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are the parts of His Body and they are worth seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even the physical feet of the Lord Jesus were worthy of being loved by that sinful woman Luke 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She honored His two feet with her hair.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The hair is the glory of a woman 1 Cor 11:15 , the top part of her body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With her top part she wiped the Savior's feet, the lowest part of His body, loving Him with her glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even His feet were worthy of her tears.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In like manner, even the weakest churches are worth seeing because they are a part of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you did not have an improper, subconscious concept, you would never say that the churches in a certain region are not worth seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also, you would never attempt to get people to move from other localities to your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No Church Being Our Church</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must learn to know our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I want to impress you and I want it to remain in your memory that no church belongs to you or to me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The churches are God's churches, Christ's churches, and the saints' churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No churches should be regional.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the churches should be catholic, universal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Strictly speaking, even the work you have done or are still doing is not your work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not consider what I am doing as my work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the Lord's work and I am just a small servant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By His mercy and grace He uses me to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not my work but His work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am a slave of the Lord and a slave of you all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am a slave even of all the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am not the master.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I cannot say this is my work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The most I can say is that this is my service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regardless of how much you have done and how wonderful what you have done is, remember that it is not your work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should not keep what you have done in "your pocket" as your work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should not hold what you have done all the time in your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I left Chefoo in 1944, nothing of the work or of the church was in "my pocket."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything was in the hands of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, when I left Shanghai in 1949, Brother Nee sent a cable, and I went to the airlines to get my reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Three days later I took the plane and went away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nothing in Shanghai was in my hands and I did not need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Also, when I left Los Angeles I never said a word to the brothers because nothing there was in my hands.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The leading brothers in Anaheim can testify that I do not know much about the church in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am just a brother attending the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes, of course, the brothers would ask me about things and I would fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is all I do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Also, sometimes the brothers would pass on the financial statement to me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord knows that I never read one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I leave it on my desk for a few days, and then it goes into the wastepaper basket.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This does not mean that I was disgusted with that financial statement.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that I do not consider that as my business.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not want to know how much money the church in Anaheim receives and spends.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not my business.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is why I have so much mental energy and time to concentrate myself on the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the main reason why I can do so much work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I do not scatter my mind or my energy to care for anything that is not within the limit of my responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord's Blessing and Our Usefulness</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To serve the Lord and to be under His blessing is not a simple thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thank the Lord that the work, thus far, has been under His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not due to me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is due to His mercy which makes "this little servant" do his best to be pure and to be clean.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The trouble among the Christians through the centuries has been impurity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Most Christians are doing good things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You cannot say that the Christians are doing bad things, but what about the purity?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whether or not you will be so useful in the Lord's hands for the long run and whether or not you will bring in the blessing for a lasting time does not depend on what you can do.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It all depends on how pure your heart is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, ambition must be excluded and pride must be put under your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There should be no ambition, no thought for position, no pride, no self regard, and no self honor.</S>
