   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ATTENDING THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH A SPIRIT OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you go to the home meeting, you must go with a spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether anyone arrives before you at the meeting, and regardless of how many people there are in the meeting, as soon as you arrive, you should begin to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to speak in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the first speaking is not to man, but to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The minute you enter the place, start praying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When all seven or eight eventually arrive, they will spontaneously pray.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this way the home meeting becomes a prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At least for ten to fifteen minutes, everyone will enter into this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>PRACTICING SINGING HYMNS FIRST AT HOME</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Again, the key to the home meetings is in singing the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all have to learn to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It would be good if after this week s home meeting, an announcement would be made for next week s reading.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no need to use a whole Life-study message; we may pick out just two paragraphs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone would then go home and prepare themselves in the assigned portions by pray-reading and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some related hymns can be selected, and one can practice singing them first at home.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you are thus prepared, you can come to the home meeting praying, singing, and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you come to a point or a sentence in the message that touches you, you can start singing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your singing must bring everyone into the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Still, you must learn to go along with the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must also learn to relate to the lowly ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a key.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>FINDING ENJOYMENT BY DIVING INTO</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you would take all the points I have just mentioned and put them into practice, your home meeting will surely be living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This will fulfill the leading the Lord has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There will be no leader, no chairman, and no one to give orders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There will be no more forms such as singing first, reading later, then preaching last, or anything like that.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praise the Lord that He has opened every book of the New Testament to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How I wish that we could go over these books one by one!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not be afraid that you will lose something by skipping over portions of the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our storehouse is filled with chicken, duck, rice, and flour.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You cannot swallow them all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All you need to do is to select a portion as a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Feast on that portion with ample reading, singing, praying, and testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This will give you the adequate satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, you have heard so much now about the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Would you now consider the home meetings to be easy or not?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you still consider them a difficult thing to do, then I do not know what else I can say to you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all have to dive into the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It does not matter whether we can play the ball or not.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are watching others play, we will surely have a lot of criticisms.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To us this player is bad at shooting and that one is awkward in running.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But once we get onto the field, not only will our criticisms be gone; we will actually begin to enjoy the game.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The same is true with everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In a concert, if I am one of the players, or if I have any part in the performance, I will enjoy it much more.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although there is only one home meeting a week, there are fifty-two weeks in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every week you have such an opportunity to breathe some fresh air and bask a little in the warm sun.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here you can sit down and have a cup of tea.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before the Lord, you can be refreshed, renewed, supplied, and comforted every week.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here you can share your burden with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You can all pray together, trust in the Lord together, and fellowship in the spirit together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is truly the greatest enjoyment and the greatest blessing the Lord has ordained for His people here on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those in the world do not have the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They do not have truth, or light, or the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They indulge themselves in card games and dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But we have the Lord, we have life, and we have the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We live a communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We fellowship together, and we know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the greatest blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I hope that we can all lay hold of these few points.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this way it is easy to conduct a home meeting.</S>
