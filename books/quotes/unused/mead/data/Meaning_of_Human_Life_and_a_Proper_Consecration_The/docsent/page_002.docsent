   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE EXERCISING THE SPIRIT, THE HEART,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE MIND USING THE SPIRIT TO PRAY-READ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we pray-read, we must first exercise, use, our spirit, because the substance of the Bible as the word of God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Chinese classics are excellent, but no matter how we read them, we cannot feel the Spirit, because the Spirit is not in them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit is in every sentence and every word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, if we do not read the Bible with our spirit, we will not be able to touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But once we use our spirit, we can touch the Spirit in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also need to read the Bible with our mouth because our human spirit is released through spoken words.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The words that we speak are the outlet of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not speak, there will be no way for the spirit to come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to light a match, we must strike it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once we strike it, the phosphorus on the match will catch fire.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One can say that the fire in the phosphorus is waiting for us to strike it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must strike the match in the right place in order for fire to be kindled.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fire in the phosphorus is an example of the spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This fire comes forth when we open our mouth to utter something, to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we say something, our spirit will come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our spirit coming forth will ignite the Spirit in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way the two spirits respond to each other; our spirit draws out the Spirit in the Bible, and the Spirit in the Bible strengthens our spirit and causes our spirit to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the way to eat the word and be satisfied, to receive light, and to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that this illustration will help us to exercise diligently when we pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether privately or in the meetings we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must not be mechanical or depend on methods that we have observed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, we must be living in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our observations should leave us only with an impression of our need to use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord is the Spirit, the words in the Bible are Spirit, and we have a spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, when we read the Bible, our spirit must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are still too mechanical because of the influence of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way that we meet is still mechanical, not living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we come to the meeting, we can begin to sing prayerfully or pray-read even before the scheduled time of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We still are not exercised in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>EXERCISING TO HAVE A LIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some saints are attending this training because they like to listen to messages or to the expounding of Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, this training is not focused on such matters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The burden of this training is neither to give messages nor to promote spiritual cultivation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our burden is to conduct a Christian training.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not a light thing to hand oneself over to the training.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should break our old concept concerning listening to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This training is for us to exercise to have a living spirit and to live in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There should no longer be any forms in our meetings; we must drop all forms.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, this does not mean that we can do things in a disorderly way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible says, The wind blows where it wills John 3:8 , but the wind does not always blow wildly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not pray-read in an old way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, we should not pray-read Genesis 1:26-28 by repeating the words mechanically.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, we should read one word at a time in order to taste the words.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are no formal rules.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether we are loud or quiet, fast or slow, our spirit must come forth as soon as we begin reading.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Someone once told me that every substance has atomic energy, but a correct method is needed in order to access this energy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The energy of the Bible is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must draw out the Spirit in our reading.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For this reason, we need to practice reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not always be scholarly, mechanical, or dead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not expect to always listen to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead, we should diligently exercise to read the Bible until we touch the Spirit in our reading.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>EXERCISING THREE ORGANS</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THE SPIRIT, THE HEART, AND THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This Christian training is not boot camp for new soldiers, nor is it orientation for new students.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Physical exercise trains a person s body and helps a person to gain physical skills.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We may think that a Christian training is to train the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, if a Christian has only a spirit, he is more like an angel than a person, because an angel has only a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christians have a soul in addition to their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Does this mean that we should also exercise our soul?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Bible does not speak of exercising our soul but of denying it because of its contamination due to the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The soul needs to be put on the cross, to be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>While the purpose of this training is to train our spirit, our heart and our mind also need to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our heart needs to be trained, because if our heart is not right, our person will not be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, the heart needs to match our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our mind is also very important.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our mind is a part of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although the Bible says that we should deny and forsake the soul Matt 16:25; Luke 9:23-24; John 12:25 , it does not say that we should forsake the function of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead, the Bible says that we should be transformed by the renewing of the mind Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, in order to be trained to be proper Christians, our spirit, our heart, and our mind need to trained.</S>
