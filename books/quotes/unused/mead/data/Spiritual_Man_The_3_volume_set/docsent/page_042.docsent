   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 8:3 says, "For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh...."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This represents the true condition of the morally minded who constitute a portion of fleshy men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They may perhaps be willing enough to devote themselves to the keeping of the law, but they are fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Being weak, they are incapable of keeping the whole law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These people come under one category.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is yet another category of men who do not keep the law of God at all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Their mind is the "mind set on the flesh" which is "enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be" v. 7 . However, the law decrees that he who keeps the law lives by the law, and he who does not keep it shall be condemned unto perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How much of the law must then be kept?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The answer is the whole law, for "whoever keeps the whole law yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all" James 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Because out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him; for through the law is the clear knowledge of sin" Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So the more man strives to keep the law, the more conscious he is of his being full of sins, incapable of keeping the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the first part of Romans 8:3 points out to us the condition of man and how sinful he is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since all men are sinful, God prepared to save them, and His way of salvation was by "sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His Son is without sin, so He alone is able to save.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"In the likeness of the flesh of sin" refers to the birth of the Lord Jesus on earth, in which He took on a human body and identified Himself with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's own Son as the "Word" came "in the likeness of the flesh of sin," that is, He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse, therefore, speaks of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The important point contained herein is that He is the Son of God and He is without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The text does not say He was made "sinful flesh" but rather "in the likeness of the flesh of sin;" that is to say, He became flesh, having the likeness of the sinful body of man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although He became flesh, He is still the Son of God and thus is still without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But as He also has the likeness of the sinful flesh of man, He is very intimately affiliated with sinners of the flesh in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What was the purpose of the Lord's incarnation?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was to be made "a sacrifice for sin" Rom 8:3, Darby, margin ; this is the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's Son is for the redemption of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who are fleshy sin against the law and cannot fulfill the righteousness of God, so they must perish and suffer the punishment for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the Lord came to the world, took on the likeness of the flesh of sin, and wholly identified Himself with all fleshly men.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So, when He died on the cross, all fleshy men were judged to have received punishment for their sins in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is sinless and need not have suffered punishment, but when He received the punishment, He had the likeness of sinful flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Accordingly, as the Head of a new race, He included all sinners in Him in suffering the punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is insofar as punishment is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fleshly men who were to receive the punishment now have in Him a sacrifice for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But what is to be done about the flesh that is filled with sins?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He "condemned sin in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was for sin that He died; thus God made the Sinless become sin on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Lord Jesus died, He died in the flesh, "being put to death in the flesh" 1 Pet 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When He died in the flesh, the sins borne by His flesh were crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is what is meant by "condemned sin in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words, it is "to judge sin in the flesh" or "to convict sin in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To condemn means to judge or to punish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The judgment and punishment for sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is meant here is that He put sin to death in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It can therefore be seen that when the Lord Jesus died, He not only died as a sacrifice for sin, suffering the punishment on behalf of men, but He also brought sin under punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As sin was condemned in the Lord's body at the time of His death, so is sin condemned in the flesh of him who is joined to the Lord's death; sin no longer has the power to harm him.</S>
