   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PRACTICE THE HOME MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Acts 5:42; 1 Cor 12:1-3, 7-10; 14:1, 3, 4b, 12, 19, 23-26, 31; 2 Cor 4:10-14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider the way to practice the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way to practice any meeting is to have first, mutuality, and second, speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These two things are very useful and prevailing in practicing any meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>MUTUALITY IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Due to the history of Christianity nearly all Christians today, including us, are not used to having mutuality in their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mostly in the so-called Christian services we see that one or two persons speak and the rest are just the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is altogether not according to the scriptural teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the New Testament there are two main categories of Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first one is the meeting of the ministry, the meeting of the apostles, the meeting of any gifted persons such as Peter on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The meeting on the day of Pentecost was a meeting for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of meeting cannot be considered as a meeting of the church and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the other hand, when 1 Corinthians 14 speaks of the meeting, it is referring to the meeting of the church and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 23 says, If therefore the whole church comes together...</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the meeting of the church and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we speak of the home meetings, we are surely referring to the meetings in the church and the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the preaching or teaching of the meeting of the ministry, there is not much mutuality and not much speaking one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But according to 1 Corinthians 14, in the church meetings there is the basic need, the basic factor of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Corinthians 14:23 says, If therefore the whole church comes together...</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then verse 26 says that in this kind of meeting each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows us that the meeting of the church and in the church depends upon mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is always the feeling of one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must keep it well in mind that the home meetings surely are not meetings of any ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The home meetings are absolutely the meetings of the church and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They depend one hundred percent upon mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is no mutuality, there is no home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To have a home meeting without mutuality causes that home meeting to lose its nature; it would not be a home meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It might still be a home meeting but only of a small ministry where one speaks while all the rest listen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A speaker would be there with a small audience, but there would be no mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Corinthians 14 is the unique chapter in Paul s writings that teaches us something about the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this unique chapter there is the basic factor of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>SPEAKING IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second factor needed for the church meetings is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If nobody speaks, that kills the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The lack of speaking kills the church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church meeting depends upon mutuality and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Scripture references for this message provide a base to fellowship concerning these two factors.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Acts 5:42 says, And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This took place at the very beginning of the church life, following the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the thousands of new believers were saved, they met in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The meeting in the temple was for the ministry, for Peter and John to minister, to speak, to preach, and to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then verse 42 goes on to say that they met from house to house, in every house.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What did they do there?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They met to teach and to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No doubt they were teaching Christ, teaching the things concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the day of Pentecost after Peter s preaching, three thousand were saved and right away began to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Surely they did not talk about the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They surely talked about what they had heard in Peter s one message.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They taught and they preached.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They preached Jesus Christ as the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In their meetings these two things were done; both involve speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To teach is to speak, and to preach is also to speak.</S>
