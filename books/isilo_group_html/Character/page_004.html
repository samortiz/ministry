<h2 class="head2">1. Strong</h2>
<p>Strength denotes firmness, not hardness. One ought to be strong but not hard, that is, strong in will but not hard in heart. The Apostle Paul said, &ldquo;Be a man, be strong&rdquo; (1 Cor. 16:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. Pliant</h2>
<p>Strength must be matched by pliancy. The expression in Chinese is &ldquo;to temper strength with pliancy.&rdquo; Strength without pliancy is hardness, which inevitably spoils things, whereas pliancy without strength results in softness, which also is useless. A watchband is both firm and flexible, capable of being bent or stretched at will.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. Submissive</h2>
<p>To be submissive is to be obedient and yielding. Some can only teach people to follow orders, but they can never submit to others. One should realize that the person who can best give orders is the person who can best receive them. Submission is an element of the divine life. Those who possess this life do not consider it shameful but proper to submit and to take orders.</p>
<p>The one who gives orders bears a heavy responsibility; those who take them bear none. How blessed it is to listen to others and to be covered in everything.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EIGHTH GROUP&mdash;SUFFERING, LOWLY, POOR</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. Suffering</h2>
<p>Suffering works endless wonders. There are some things which one cannot pass through without suffering. The more a person is able to suffer, the more useful he is. One who is not ready to suffer cannot accomplish great things. Fitting is the ancient proverb, &ldquo;He who endures the worst of sufferings is the best among men.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. Lowly</h2>
<p>One should aim high but conduct himself in a lowly way. Romans 12:16 says that we should be &ldquo;led away to the lowly.&rdquo; Only by taking a lowly position can one help others. No matter how respected and highly esteemed a person may be, he should take a lowly position. This is not to pretend to be humble but rather to genuinely confess from the heart that one has nothing of which to boast.</p>
<p>First Peter 5:5 says, &ldquo;God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. Poor</h2>
<p>The world covets position and riches, but a Christian must be content with and even choose poverty. Poverty has its usefulness as well as its delight. However, one should not make himself poor by being lazy. Such poverty is worthless and futile. A willingness to be poor for the Lord&rsquo;s sake when one has the ability and even the opportunity to be rich, or a practice of spending all one&rsquo;s money for the Lord, are both rare and precious. The life of Christ is a life that chooses to be poor. Consider how He left His throne to be born in a manger and to live in Nazareth, tasting all the privation of human life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NINTH GROUP&mdash;STEADFAST, ENDURING, BEARING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. Steadfast</h2>
<p>Steadfast means persevering. The best is usually reserved for last. Anything that grows quickly also withers quickly. Nothing that is deep, weighty, and superior can be obtained in a short time or by chance. Specifically, there are no shortcuts in spiritual things. Steadfastness and perseverance are the prerequisites for gaining that which is excellent.</p>
<p>Many Bible truths which are at first incomprehensible despite one&rsquo;s desire to know them eventually become understandable through persistent reading of the Scriptures. To be steadfast is to not covet the grand and quick results. There is an old saying that &ldquo;drops of water eventually can penetrate a stone.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. Enduring</h2>
<p>One who is able to endure is able to withstand mistreatment. Do not mistreat others, but endure their mistreatment. A young man should not avoid ill-treatment and take the easy way out; rather, he should suffer abuse willingly. The more difficult the lesson, the deeper and more profitable it is.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. Bearing</h2>
<p>A person of character must be able to bear pressure. Anything that is solid and strong must first be pressed. A diamond is formed through intense pressure. That which grows without restriction usually is not beautiful. However, do not invite others to put pressure on you; rather, you should put yourself under pressure. The combination of the five preceding character traits&mdash;suffering, lowly, poor, steadfast, and enduring&mdash;gives a person the ability to bear pressure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TENTH GROUP&mdash;CLEAR, MAGNANIMOUS, GRAVE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. Clear</h2>
<p>Clarity here does not mean brightness; it denotes understanding. People are often ignorant of their own dullness and stupidity. One should know himself as well as others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. Magnanimous</h2>
<p>Being magnanimous is similar to being broad. To be broad is to be tolerant of others, and to be magnanimous is to be not cruel to others. In dealing with others, one must supplement affection, ardor, and accommodation with magnanimity. It is difficult to have an enemy-loving life without a magnanimous character. A cruel person is always jealous, while a magnanimous person is able to forgive. It is permissible to speak severely to others, but never cruelly. Neither should one be foolishly kind.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. Grave</h2>
<p>One who is grave is not frivolous. Whatever a grave person does carries weight. Whether a matter is great or small, its importance and weight depend on whose hands it is in. In the hands of a grave person, even a small matter will be taken seriously by others. Conversely, in the hands of a light person, a significant matter will be considered by others as inconsequential. In learning to be grave, first, one should not express his opinions lightly; second, one should not judge or criticize flippantly; and third, one should speak slowly and accurately. It is not that one should be silent but that one should speak with discretion.</p>
<p>He who is grave is protected, for evil temptations do not come to him easily. Especially in the case of a young woman, gravity brings protection, while lightness invites harm.</p>
<p>Be affectionate, ardent, and accommodating toward others, and conduct yourself with gravity.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Character &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
