	 <h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE BREAKING</h2>
<p>The Lord has been working among us and leading us throughout the years. Now many brothers and sisters have been brought to the point where they must pass through a crisis; that is, there is a problem within them that must be resolved. This problem is related to coordination, that is, to the work. The problem is that there are matters in us that still have not been broken. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, some saints have a fearful heart before the Lord. As a result, if they have an opinion, they dare not express it, and if they have something to say, they dare not voice it. This preserves a peaceful situation outwardly; however, the brothers and sisters experience no inward breaking.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of being broken in particular matters, the brothers and sisters seemingly do not have any problems, but actually they inwardly encounter real difficulties. These problems affect the coordination. Some have a feeling regarding certain matters within them, but they would not submit to or accept the feeling. Although they know that certain matters within them should be condemned, they are not determined to condemn these matters. Even though the saints know that these matters are natural, of the flesh, have been rejected by the Lord, and are what the Lord wants them to reject, few have the intention or determination to reject these matters. This is our human weakness, our human condition.</p>
<p>Many times the Lord has given us a feeling that we should deal with a certain matter, but for some reason, our feeling toward the matter is slothful and inadequate, and our spirit is reluctant to move. It seems that our mind knows that the matter should be judged and condemned, but our spirit cannot rise up, and our entire being cannot move. It is true that we have been enlightened, but within us there is no response to the shining and no ability to move. Hence, when people contact us, they sense that we are dull and closed both to them and to the Lord. Because we have a heart that fears the Lord, we dare not blame the brothers or have any disharmony with them, yet inwardly we are full of reservations.</p>
<p>Today many brothers and sisters among us in local churches are in this condition. This does not mean that they have backslidden spiritually; rather, they have come to a certain stage in their spiritual journey, a stage through which we all must pass. When we first begin to serve the Lord, there is a period of excitement. During this time, it is difficult for us to discover our problems, because we are immature and stay in the excitement of our emotion. In this time of excitement, it is difficult to discover the natural hindrances in us. Under the Lord&rsquo;s leading, however, we pass through a long process and spontaneously enter into another stage. At this time, the excitement and tide of our feelings subside. We then discover that within us there remains something that hinders us from coordinating with the brothers, something quite strong, something as big and hard as the rocks by the seashore, that is, our natural man, our flesh, and the self.</p>
<p>We have been shown mercy and have learned the lesson of fearing God; hence, even though we know that we cannot coordinate with the brothers, we do not dare to let ourselves, our flesh, become loose. Outwardly, it may seem that something has changed, but inwardly, something remains which causes us to be in the self, to be unable to coordinate with the brothers, and to be closed to them and to the Lord. Some people remain in this condition for many years. We human beings are strange. When it comes to the matter of submission, we are not clear-cut and decisive. Even when we have had some deep inward experiences, we are still hesitant in the matter of submission. Some hesitate for a period of a year or two, perhaps even for three or four years. Many times we know clearly that there is a certain matter in which we need to submit; nevertheless, even though the feeling to submit is in us, we do not submit.</p>
<p>Today in many churches a number of brothers and sisters are inwardly dull and dead, without the freshness and livingness of life. This is mainly because they are not willing to submit and be broken. They do not quarrel or argue with others and do not criticize or condemn others; however, if we have a keen sense in our spirit, we touch a pile of hard rocks within them. The tide comes and goes, but the pile of rocks stands firm and stable. Although the Lord has shined on them many times, and their inner sense condemns the same matters again and again, submission is difficult for such people.</p>
<p>We are often slothful and stingy in the matter of submission; thus, we truly need more of the Lord&rsquo;s grace and mercy. We may see our natural man and know our self, but we may have no power to overcome them. We have no way to deal with our natural man, and we have no power to respond to the Lord&rsquo;s demands in us. We must ask the Lord to have mercy on us and to add grace to us so that by Him we can deal with and solve this problem.</p>
