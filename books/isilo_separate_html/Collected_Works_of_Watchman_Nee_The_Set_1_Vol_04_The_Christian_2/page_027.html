Because they are mysteries, they are not just physical objects but carry with them spiritual significance. A mystery is something with a hidden spiritual meaning. Unless God explains them to man, mysteries are incomprehensible. It is not that mysteries defy comprehension. They can be understood, but it requires God's revelation. Since this book is a revelation from God, all the mysteries here are not total mysteries but are revealed mysteries. After all, there are not many symbols in this book, and of those, over one half have been explained. We should not consider this book as a book of mystery.</P><P>Initially we may not understand the meaning of the seven stars held in the Lord's hand. However, our gracious Lord explained it to us: "The seven stars are messengers of the seven churches." Most people do not have any idea who these messengers are. People's opinions are divided. Let us put away every tendency of argument and apply a spirit of quietness to study the Word of our Lord.</P><P>These messengers are not the men sent by the seven churches to carry back the letters from John. Although some may make this assumption, neither the Bible nor history has any such record. The earnestness of the Lord's rebuke and expectations of them in chapters two and three show that they are not traveling messengers, but rather people who are stationed in the churches.</P><P>Some brothers assume that these messengers refer to the pastors or overseers of the various churches. They believe in one man monopolizing the church business. I do not wish to argue here or to give rise to opinions. Almost all the churches in the various parts of China adopt this kind of "one-man system" with one pastor or one overseer administrating over a church. For the sake of God's truth and out of love let me apply some scriptural teachings to expose the shortcomings of this view. I pray for the tolerance of those who do not agree with my thoughts.</P><P>According to the Bible, the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers are the gifts God bestowed upon the whole church. In the Bible we cannot find an apostle for this or that specific church. Similarly, we do not see a pastor for this or that church. It is true that from the Bible we see overseers and deacons for a church. However, the overseers are plural in number, not singular. All the overseers of the church in the Bible are plural in number. These overseers are the same as the elders (Acts 20:17-18; Titus 1:5, 7). "And when they had appointed elders for them in every church" (Acts 14:23). If we say one messenger administrates over one church and that the messenger refers to the pastor or the overseer, and that consequently it is scriptural to have one pastor or one elder to govern over one church, we will encounter many problems. We cannot base the church's most important system on the interpretation of one debatable verse. Furthermore, the shepherds belong to the whole church, and overseers are more than one! I do not think that Revelation 1:20 carries this meaning. Speaking for myself, I dare not add in anything that God has not said.</P><P>Prior to this, the church in Ephesus had elders and overseers already (Acts 20:17-18). According to tradition, John himself was an overseer in Ephesus. How could the Lord command John to write a letter to John himself? Moreover, in the Bible we find examples of letters written to individuals, such as those to Titus and Timothy. However, we cannot find any letter written to a church through an individual. We can also find letters written to all the elders, the deacons, and to the saints in Philippi. We cannot find a letter which is written only to the elders and the deacons and yet was considered to be written to the entire church. Some thirty years earlier when Paul wrote to the church in Ephesus, he was writing to the saints there. Can we say that John was now writing only to their pastors? Does this not differ greatly from the first letter to Ephesus? Moreover, the word "messenger" is the interpretation of the mystery of the star. Therefore, the word "messenger" must be a plain word according to the Lord. If the word "messenger" refers to the pastor or the overseer, then the messenger must also be a mystery. The Lord would not use one mystery to explain another mystery and use an unknown tongue to explain another unknown tongue. If so, this book would become a book of "inspiration" rather than "revelation." We trust that our Lord does not make mistakes and that He knew what the word "star" referred to. When He declared the star to be the messenger, then the star is truly the messenger and is not whatever men might say it is.</P><P>We should realize that the problem of the church system is one on which God's children are least able to agree. We truly do not desire to stir up any argument here. However, we all have to pay attention to one point, that is, in every matter we should not act contrary to the Bible. If we are willing to forsake our own denominational concept and base all our actions on the standard, "thus saith the Lord," then we will not err. The Lord will show His way to those who are meek. We should have the spirit of a learner and a pliable will to allow the Lord to show His mind to us. While the cry for an indigenous church today carries such high pitch-and perhaps the church will go through a major change in the near future-may we understand what the will of God is toward the church so that we will not compound mistake upon mistake. We realize the fact that there are not many who are truly following the Lord. How few are those that are willing to leave the present denominations and go out of the camp to suffer reproach. Nevertheless, the Lord always has a remnant. Praise Him, there will always be a handful left who are faithful to Him.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
