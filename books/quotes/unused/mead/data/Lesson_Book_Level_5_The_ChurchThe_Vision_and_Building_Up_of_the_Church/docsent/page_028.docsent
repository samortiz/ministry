   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 1:20b explains that "the seven lampstands are seven churches.''</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church, therefore, is signified by a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The revelation concerning the golden lampstand is found in Exodus, Zechariah, and Revelation.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a type of Christ, the lampstand portrays Christ as the resurrection life growing, branching, budding, and blossoming to shine the light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jesus Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is in Him, and apart from Him no one can find God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A. Gold Signifying the Father's Divine Nature, the Divine Substance, Essence</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With the lampstand as a type of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, there are three important things: the gold, the stand, and the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These three matters imply the significance of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Gold is the substance with which the lampstand is made, the stand is the embodiment of the gold, and the lamps are the expression of the stand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Exodus 25:31, the lampstand was made of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Gold was the substance, the element of the lampstand in its entirety.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In typology, gold signifies the divine nature, the nature of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we consider this substance, this element of the lampstand, we shall see that it signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, by this we can see God the Father, the One whose nature is the substance of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The golden lampstand exists in the nature of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God the Father is signified by the gold with which the lampstand was made.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, with the gold we see the first of the divine Trinity, the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. The Form Signifying the Son as the Embodiment of the Godhead in His Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Exodus 25 the lampstand made of pure gold had a definite form or shape.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The form of the golden lampstand signifies the Son as the embodiment of the Godhead in His humanity Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the form, the shape, of the lampstand signifies the second of the Trinity, the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God the Father is invisible and abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God the Son is the embodiment of this invisible One.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The stand is a form signifying God the Son as the embodiment of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This solid form of the lampstand is the embodiment of the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the New Testament, God the Father is embodied in God the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, in the lampstand we have the substance signifying the Father, and the solid form signifying the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The gold of the lampstand was made into a prescribed form, which indicated its function.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This form is Christ, who is the image of God 2 Cor 4:4; Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When God created man, He created him in His image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since Christ is God's image, man was created according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God does not have a physical form, but He does have an expression of His image.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ, the beloved Son, is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The function of this image, this form, is to express God.</S>
