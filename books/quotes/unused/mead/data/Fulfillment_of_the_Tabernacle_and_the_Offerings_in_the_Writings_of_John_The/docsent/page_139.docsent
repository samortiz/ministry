   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESURRECTED TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Father's house is also the resurrected temple.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This temple is Christ enlarged in resurrection as the house of God, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 2:19-21 speaks of this: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then the Jews said, It took forty-six years to build this temple, and you will raise it up in three days?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But He spoke of the temple of His body."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The resurrected temple in John 2:19-21 is Christ raised up with His members, who are the many abodes in the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These many abodes are also the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the sons of God together are the many abodes in the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Ephesians 2:6 and 1 Peter 1:3, we, the members of Christ, have been raised up with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The resurrected temple is built up a spiritual house with Christ as the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning the spiritual house, 1 Peter 2:5 says, "You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning Christ as the foundation, 1 Corinthians 3:11 says, "For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The resurrected temple is the house of the living God, and this house is the pillar and base of the reality 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians 3:16 and 17 also indicate clearly that the believers are the temple of God: "Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, which you are."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ephesians 2:21 and 22 reveal that the resurrected temple is the dwelling place of God in our spirit: "In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fact that God's dwelling place is in our spirit indicates that the church is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever we are out of the spirit and in our natural mind, we are outside of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the church life is in our spirit, we all need to learn the lesson of turning to our spirit and staying there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many of us can testify that after coming into the church life, we have learned to turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, sometimes we may leave the spirit and dwell in our natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a result, we may have questions concerning the church and problems with the church and with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The longer we stay away from our spirit, the more questions and problems we shall have.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we come back to our spirit and stay in the spirit, to us the church life will be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today the Father's house is in our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the resurrected temple the believers dwell with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 14:3 the Lord Jesus says, "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be."</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through His death and resurrection He has brought His disciples into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because He is in the Father, therefore, they also are in the Father by being in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, where He is, the disciples are also.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now in Christ we dwell with Him in the Father.</S>
