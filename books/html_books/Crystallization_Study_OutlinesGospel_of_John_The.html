The Word of God here in John 1:1 refers to Christ, the only begotten Son of God (v. 18) as the definition, explanation, and expression of God:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The great "I Am," self-existing and ever-existing&#151;Exo. 3:14-15; John 8:24, 28, 58.</li>	<li>Eternal, without beginning or ending&#151;Heb. 7:3.</li>	</ol><li>John 1 is the introduction to the whole Gospel of John, and the main stress of this introduction is that Christ is the Word of God&#151;the definition, explanation, and expression of the mysterious and invisible God. It refers to Christ in the five greatest events in the history of the universe:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>In the creation of all things in the beginning of time (John 1:3).</li>	<li>In the incarnation of the invisible God to be a visible man (John 1:14), partaking of man's flesh and blood (Heb. 2:14), for the redemption of the lost universe to bring in the New Testament age.</li>	<li>In becoming the Lamb to take away the sin of the world (mankind) judicially for the New Testament (John 1:29, 36).</li>	<li>In becoming the Spirit for the transformation of God's redeemed people into stones (John 1:32-42) for the building of God's house (Bethel&#151;v. 51) organically for the New Testament.</li>	<li>In being the heavenly ladder to bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven at Bethel, the house of God, from His coming back to eternity (John 1:51; Gen. 28:11-22).</li>	<li>In all these five universal, historical events, Christ, the Word of God (as: 1. the Creator in creation; 2. the man in incarnation; 3. the Lamb in redemption; 4. the Spirit in transformation; 5. the ladder in joining earth to heaven), defines, explains, and expresses the invisible God:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In His creation "the heavens are telling of the glory of God; and the firmament [expanse] is declaring the work of His hands. Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night reveals knowledge. There is no speech, nor are there words; their voice is not heard" (Psa. 19:1-3), and the invisible things of God, "both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world" (Rom. 1:20). What is referred to in Acts 14:15-17 and 17:24-29 serves the same purpose of revealing Christ's creation.</li>		<li>In His incarnation He unveils that the Creator has become one of His creatures (Col. 1:15), bringing God into man, mingling divinity with humanity as one, and in His human living He expresses God in the divine attributes through His human virtues.</li>		<li>In His becoming the Lamb for the redemption of the lost world, Christ speaks to us how God accomplished His redemption judicially through His death as the procedure according to His righteousness.</li>		<li>In His becoming the Spirit for life-giving and transforming (1 Cor. 15:45), Christ speaks to us further how God carries out His economy organically by His divine life for His divine purpose according to His heart's desire.</li>		<li>Christ, in His being the heavenly ladder at Bethel, also speaks to us how God desires to have a house on the earth constituted with His redeemed and transformed elect, that He may bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven, to make the two as one for eternity.</li>		</ol>	<P>P.S. In addition to all the above items, John, in his last writing, Revelation, tells us that even in the warfare for the kingdom of God, Christ is the Word of God speaking for God's purpose (Rev. 19:13).</P>	</ol></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>Message Two</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>The Word of God</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><ol class="upper-roman" start="3"><li>The intrinsic, central line of the five historical events in the introduction to the Gospel of John as the "trunk" is that:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>In the Word, who is Christ as the definition, explanation, and expression of God, is life&#151;John 1:4a.</li>	<li>The life in the Word is the light that speaks to the world by shining forth, as His coming to the world, what God is&#151;John 1:4b-11.</li>	<li>Whoever receives the shining light, which is Christ Himself, can have the divine life, carried forth by the light, that they may be born of God to be His children as the constituents of the house of God, Bethel&#151;John 1:12-13.</li>	<li>This ultimately consummates the New Jerusalem organically for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy revealed to us by the same writer, John&#151;Rev. 21:2.</li>	</ol><li>The Word, God, and the Spirit, the three cooperating and coordinating together in the speaking for God:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God has the Word to speak for Him and He also has the Spirit to bring forth the Word. This is seen in the creation when Christ as the Word of God was creating by speaking (thus, the universe has been framed by the word of God&#151;Heb. 11:3), and the Spirit of God was brooding (Gen. 1:2).</li>	<li>In addition to the speaking of Christ as the Word in the five great historical events, Christ as the Word of God spoke for God by the prophets through His Spirit (1 Pet. 1:10-11). When a particular point concerning Christ was conceived in a God-seeking person as a prophet, the Spirit of Christ brought forth the speaking of it through the prophet as the instrument. This was the way of the prophecy concerning Christ by the prophets in the Old Testament (Luke 24:44). It was Christ as the Word of God, God Himself, and the speaking Spirit of God cooperating and coordinating in the speaking for God in the prophecies concerning Christ. This can be illustrated by Isaiah 7:14 concerning Christ being born of a virgin, Micah 5:2 concerning the birthplace of Christ, Daniel 9:26 concerning the time of the death of Christ, Malachi 4:2 concerning Christ's second appearing as the Sun of righteousness, etc.</li>	<li>In the New Testament Christ as the Word of God was incarnated to be a man (John 1:14) to express God, that is, to speak God. Hence, Hebrews 1:2 says that at the last of these days God has spoken to us in the Son. The sonship in God's New Testament economy is not only individual but also corporate. In the New Testament God speaks in Christ as His firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29), indicating that all the brothers of His firstborn Son as His many sons have to be the word of God speaking for God. They are not only the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, etc. (Eph. 4:11), but, even more, the sons of God, who are the members of His firstborn Son. They are much higher than the Old Testament prophets.</li>	<li>Christ as the Word of God in three forms:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In the form of a Person&#151;Christ Himself.</li>		<li>When He was prophesied by the prophets of the Old Testament and spoken by Christ with all His brothers as His members, it is the spoken word.</li>		<li>When the spoken word is written down, that which can constitute the Bible is the written word.</li>		</ol>	<li>When the word remains in us, it is the speaking of God. When it is spoken by us and received by others, it becomes spirit and life (John 6:63). When it remains in them, it is again the word, but when it is spoken forth by them through the Spirit (1 Cor. 7:40), it becomes spirit and life. In this way Christ being the Word of God implies Himself as the word in the form of a Person, the spoken word, and the written word&#151;the Bible. All these define, explain, and express God as the revelation of God.</li>	</ol></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>Message Three</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>God</H1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>God, as the second crystal in the writings of John, is unveiled as the fountain (source) of life:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Flowing out to dispense Himself with His divine life as the life element, the life supply (Christ as the tree of life), to meet the need of His elect and to be their pleasures and satisfaction (Rev. 22:1-2; cf.

For this purpose, when Christ died on the cross, not only blood (signifying redemption judicially) flowed forth but also water (signifying the water of life organically to be dispensed into God's elect)&#151;John 19:34.</li>	<li>Whatever He flows out is "bright as crystal"&#151;Rev. 22:1.</li>	<li>The Lord's calling with a promise:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To the thirsty and water-seeking Samaritan woman He said that He has the living water, which is able to cause her to never thirst again&#151;John 4:10, 14.</li>		<li>To those who held the Feast of Tabernacles, on the last day of their feast, He said, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.

The Father is the Originator, making the divine economy (Eph. 1:9-10; 3:9; 1 Tim. 1:4b); the Son accomplishes the divine economy made by the Father (John 5:19; 8:28); and the Spirit applies to God's elect what the Son has accomplished (16:13). Even so, They are still one in harmony in the economical Trinity (10:30; 17:21, 23):</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The Father spoke in heaven concerning the Son, the Son stood in the water on the earth, and the Spirit soared as the dove in the air&#151;Matt. 3:16-17.</li>			<li>The Father chose the believers before the foundation of the world, the Son redeemed them in time, and the Spirit sealed them after they believed in the Son&#151;Eph. 1:4, 6-7, 13.</li>			<li>Words like these in the Scripture are strong evidence that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are economically three.

Heb. 1:1-2a; 4:12; 2 Tim. 3:15-17; 1 Pet. 1:10-12; John 6:63.</li>	<li>The life contained in Himself as the Word of God (John 1:4a; 11:25; 14:6; 10:10b) to be the base of a believer's life.</li>	<li>The light of life (John 1:4b-12; 8:12; 9:5; 12:46) to bring the divine life to the world by shining (speaking) forth God that man may be born of God to be His children, making man God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead.</li>	<li>The flesh through His incarnation (John 1:14a), that is, a man fallen in sin, but Romans 8:3 tells us that Christ became the "flesh of sin" only in its "likeness," without its sin in reality. It was in the "likeness of the flesh of sin" that God had the way to condemn sin, that is, to annihilate sin, to abolish sin.</li>	<li>The tabernacle of God (John 1:14b) which refers to Jesus as a man in the flesh to be God's temporary dwelling place on the earth. God dwelt in Him as in the tabernacle (tent) in the wilderness, like the children of Israel had the tabernacle of God as God's dwelling place while they were wandering in the wilderness (Exo. 25:8-9).</li>	<li>The Lamb, the Spirit, the house (Bethel), and the heavenly ladder (John 1:29-51), which form a group of what Christ is, as the Word of God speaking for God, in the accomplishment of God's eternal economy:</li>		<ol class="lower-alpha">		<li>Christ is the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world judicially (vv. 29, 36) to make whatever He did for God's economy legal according to the righteousness of God.</li>		<li>Christ firstly had the dove, signifying the Spirit of God abiding upon Him (vv.  32-33), and subsequently in His resurrection He became, organically, the Spirit of God who gives life (1 Cor. 15:45b). As such a Spirit, He transforms God's redeemed people, who were made with clay, into stones (vv. 37-42).</li>		<li>It is for the building up of the house of God at Bethel (this house of God is the intrinsic and basic line of the Gospel of John concerning the church, the Body of Christ) that His redeemed people are transformed by the Spirit into stones organically (1 Pet. 2:5).</li>		<li>In Bethel, the house of God, Christ is the heavenly ladder that brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven as well (v. 51); the consummation of this is the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2).</li>		<li>In doing all these things for God's economy, Christ is the Messiah, the Christ of God (v. 41).</li>		</ol>	<li>The temple of God (John 2:15-22), which Christ called His Father's house, firstly referring to Christ individually before His resurrection and then referring to Christ with His believers as His increase corporately after His resurrection to be God's permanent dwelling place in the spiritual world. This house of the Father is built by Christ and God with the believers as its constituents (14:2, 23).</li>	<li>The serpent lifted up on the cross (John 3:14), referring to Christ, who was crucified as the biting serpent for all the people bitten by the devil as the serpent, making them serpents (sinners). In His redemption God made Christ the replacement for the sinners, who are serpents in the eyes of God, to suffer God's judgment on the cross. In type the serpent, which signifies Christ as the replacement of God's people, is a bronze serpent, a serpent "in likeness" but not in reality. He "did not know sin" but was only "made sin" by God in its likeness (2 Cor. 5:21). Similarly, in incarnation Christ became "in the likeness of the flesh of sin," without the sin of the flesh (Rom. 8:3).</li>	<li>The eternal life (John 3:15, 16, 36). In this book, the Gospel of John, the eternal life is the basic factor of all that Christ is. Because He is the eternal life, the divine life, even God Himself, He can be what He is and is able to speak for God to carry out the full salvation of God organically for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy, which issues in the New Jerusalem.</li>	<li>The bride, produced by regeneration and taken by Christ as the Bridegroom, is the increase, the enlargement, of Christ, who gives the Spirit not by measure and, as the immeasurable One, gives eternal life (the unlimited life) to His believers (3:29-30, 34, 36).</li>	<li>The spring of living water (John 4:14) of which God is the fountain. Whoever drinks the living water that Christ gives shall never thirst. Verse 24 in the same chapter indicates that such drinkers are the true worshippers of God, indicating that the true worship of God is to drink of Him in Christ.</li>	</ol></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>Message Six</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>The All-inclusive Christ</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><ol class="upper-alpha" start="2"><li>In His perfect redemption through His death judicially and in His complete salvation by His life organically for the carrying out of God's eternal economy, He is:</li>	<ol class="decimal" start="13">	<li>The Feast of the Passover&#151;John 6:4:</li>		<ol class="lower-alpha">		<li>It is the first feast of all the feasts ordained by God for His people (Lev. 23:5), typifying that Christ is the beginning of our enjoyment of Him that originates our spiritual life.</li>		<li>In this feast the main enjoyments are the Passover lamb with its blood for redeeming and its flesh for fighting and walking, and the unleavened bread signifying a sinless living (Exo. 12:5-8).</li>		<li>In the enjoyment of Christ we must eat His flesh and drink His blood that we may have His eternal life (John 6:54) and eat Him as the heavenly bread that we may live forever (v. 58) through His word, which is spirit and life to us (v. 63).</li>		</ol>	<li>The Feast of Tabernacles&#151;John 7:2:</li>		<ol class="lower-alpha">		<li>John in his Gospel refers to us firstly the Feast of the Passover as the beginning of our enjoyment of Christ for the initiation of God's redemption judicially.</li>		<li>Then he also refers to us the Feast of Tabernacles, signifying the consummation of God's full salvation organically.</li>		<li>The Feast of Tabernacles, which is the last feast of all the feasts ordained by God for His people (Lev. 23:34, 39-43), is for Israel's enjoyment of the rich produce of the good land at its harvest time for their satisfaction.</li>		<li>Christ is our good land with all its produce for our enjoyment and satisfaction.</li>		<li>He cried out on the last day of the feast, saying, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.

John 14&#151;16 is a long discourse of Christ on the night before His crucifixion. That discourse is concerning the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, the constitution of the processed Triune God with His regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed people. To participate in this organism, the divine and human constitution, we need the way, the reality, and the life, all of which are the exercise of Christ as the eternal resurrection:</li>		<ol class="lower-alpha">		<li>The way is Christ in resurrection to be our reality and life. Vanity, as described by Solomon in Ecclesiastes, and death, as explained by Paul in his Epistles, can never be the way for anyone to participate in the organism of the processed Triune God.</li>		<li>The reality is all that God is, which becomes the person of Christ. The way to participate in the divine and human constitution, which is the organic Body of Christ, is to enjoy all that the person of Christ is, which is His unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8).</li>		<li>Life is the divine element of the person of Christ. If we have Christ, we possess the divine element, which is His divine constitution of all the attributes of what God is. In regeneration we have received this life, and in the growth of the divine life through sanctification, renewing, transformation, etc., we participate in the reality of Christ, which is the way for us to enter into the Body of Christ, which is the Father's house that consummates the New Jerusalem.</li>		</ol>	<li>The Comforter, referring to Christ coming in the flesh to be the first Comforter (Paraclete) to take care of our cases and affairs and to Christ realized as the Spirit to be our second Comforter both in us and in heaven before God the Father&#151;John 14:16-17; 1 John 2:1.</li>	<li>The all-inclusive consummated Spirit&#151;John 20:22:</li>		<ol class="lower-alpha">		<li>This consummated Spirit is Christ's breath.</li>		<li>He is the Holy Spirit of God processed through Christ's death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), who is the consummation of the earthly ministry of Christ and the closing of Christ's speaking from His incarnation, God becoming the flesh, to His transfiguration of the flesh, the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit (see Message Eight on the Consummated Spirit).</li>		</ol>	</ol></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>Message Eight</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>The Consummated Spirit</H1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Before the consummation of the Spirit, He was:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Spirit of God in God's creation&#151;Gen. 1:2.</li>	<li>The Spirit of Jehovah in God's contact with man&#151;Judg. 6:34; Isa. 61:1.</li>	<li>The Spirit of holiness in God's dealing with man&#151;Psa. 51:11; Isa. 63:10-11.</li>	</ol><li>Through the processes which the Triune God has completed, the Spirit of God as the processed Triune God has been consummated into the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To be "the Spirit," who was not yet, before the resurrection of Christ&#151;John 7:39.</li>	<li>Compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power to be the compound anointing ointment&#151;Exo. 30:23-25.</li>	<li>To be the consummated Spirit of the Triune God as the consummation of the Triune God.</li>	<li>The Spirit who has been consummated to be the consummation of the Triune God as the eternal Husband speaking with His bride, the Body of Christ, to be the eternal and universal couple&#151;Rev. 22:17.</li>	<li>The Spirit of life&#151;Rom. 8:2.</li>	<li>The Spirit of Christ, who is the Spirit of the Christ in resurrection&#151;the pneumatic Christ&#151;Rom. 8:9.</li>	<li>The indwelling Spirit, who dispenses the resurrection life to the believers' mortal body&#151;Rom. 8:11.</li>	<li>The Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross.

But today most Christians are just lingering in its judicial section and are satisfied with it, paying very little attention to its organic section and missing the critical point of the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God. The critical need of the Lord's recovery today is not to be held back by the satisfaction of its judicial section but to press forward to carry out its organic section so that there may be the possibility of accomplishing the eternal economy of God.</P></body></html>
