<h2 class="head1">BEING TWO GREAT GIFTS</h2>
<p>By means of the Word and the Spirit we receive the divine element; we gain and enjoy Christ. God gives all His riches to us in Christ. This is the only treasure in the universe. God gives this treasure to us through the Word and the Spirit. To say that God gives Himself to us in Christ is rather abstract and general. It is more concrete and specific to say that God gives Himself to us in the Word and in the Spirit. God has given us the Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit, through which we can enjoy everything that He is. Therefore, the Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit are two great gifts from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God is embodied in Christ so that we may receive Him through the Word and the Spirit. Hence, in order to gain God, we must contact the Word and the Spirit. We contact the Word by reading the Bible, and we contact the Spirit through prayer.</p>
<p>Even though Christians are familiar with reading the Bible and praying, these two matters are not simple. There are many ways to read the Bible and to pray, each of which has its own benefits. We have spent much time studying different ways; hence, we can conclude that the most simple and effective way to read the Bible and to pray is to read the Bible through prayer.</p>
<p>Every portion of the Bible that we read should be turned into prayer. This is the basic principle. We must not read the Bible without praying, nor should we separate reading the Bible from praying, as if reading the Bible and praying are unrelated. A brother may read Matthew 17, regarding the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on the mountain, and then pray for his wife and children. Another brother may read John 10, regarding God giving eternal life to man, and then pray for the prosperity of his business and for healing. In these two instances, reading the Bible and praying do not match. Some saints are better; they read the Gospel of John and pray for the revival of the church. Other saints may read the Gospel of Matthew and pray for the building of the church, or they may read the Gospel of Luke and pray for the saints to exercise the spirit. These are not wrong or improper prayers, but this is not what we are referring to in relation to reading the Bible.</p>
<p>We are not emphasizing praying for matters. This fellowship is concerning turning the portions of the Word that we read into prayer. After reading a sentence in the Bible, a brother should turn that sentence into prayer. If he is inspired by a point in the Word, he should turn that point into prayer. This way of praying is not related to specific matters; it has nothing to do with such things. This way of praying concentrates on turning what we read in the Bible into prayer. Every local church should take this way. This is not only for those who take the lead; every saint must be brought into this way of praying.</p>
<p>While a brother reads the Bible during morning watch, he should also pray. This prayer is to digest what he reads in the Bible. He does not need to pray for many matters, all of which the Lord knows: &ldquo;For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things&rdquo; (Matt. 6:32). There is no need for the brother to ask about many things. His prayer should be his enjoying Christ and assimilating Christ according to what he reads in the Bible.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the messages that we hear. We should not merely listen to a message and understand it without turning what we have heard and understood into prayer. Our mind can become sharp, and we can become more knowledgeable, but as a result of a lack of prayer our spirit will wither. Every time we hear a message, we should turn what we have heard into prayer, thus digesting the Lord&rsquo;s word in prayer. If we are willing to practice turning what we read in the Bible into prayer and what we hear of the Word into prayer, our spirit will become living. Only by such a practice can the Christ revealed in the ministry of the word and in the Bible become the real and living Christ in our spirit. Eventually, our flesh will be swallowed up, our natural life will be killed, and we will live out the Christ whom we have assimilated. This is not a matter of imitating Christ. By turning what we read in the Bible into prayer, we assimilate Christ, and He becomes our supply and life element for our transformation. As a result, we express Christ.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother reads Mark 6:30-44, which is concerning the Lord feeding five thousand with five loaves and two fish. He should not focus on the Lord&rsquo;s power that performed the miracle but on the details of how the Lord handled the situation. This is what he should turn into prayer. Then he will touch the Lord&rsquo;s fineness and sweetness. He might say, &ldquo;Lord, there were five thousand men, not including the women and children. These people were hungry. As soon as they heard that they would be fed, they must have rushed over to You. But You did not panic; instead, You charged them to recline on the grass so that they would not tread upon one another. Lord, You are so composed and wise.&rdquo; This is the way to turn what we read in the Bible into prayer. He may also say, &ldquo;Lord, You are not only wise, but You are also organized. You not only told them to sit down, but You also told them to sit down in groups by hundreds and by fifties.&rdquo; This is to receive the knowledge in the Word into our spirit. This is the way for the divine element to increase within us and to change our nature, transforming us into the image of the Lord. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we will be &ldquo;transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; This is not self-improvement but enjoyment and transformation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Let us now consider our knowledge of Christ and our seeing the vision of Christ. There are two ways to receive a vision of Christ. One way is to see a complete vision once and for all. The other way is to see small progressive visions. All those who see a complete vision will later see the details of the vision. They first see an overall picture, and then they later see different parts of the picture. Contrarily, those who see smaller visions will eventually see the complete vision. They see small visions, which expand into a complete vision.</p>
<p>For example, when we look at a map of the city of Taipei, we quickly see a panoramic view of Taipei. This is the large vision. But we still need to walk through the streets of Taipei using this map. Then the streets of Taipei will become real, and we will gain knowledge of the streets of Taipei. Knowing the streets of Taipei is the small vision. However, some people, such as pedicab drivers, are illiterate and cannot read a map. They drive to this street today and that street tomorrow. After three years the whole city of Taipei will become clear in their being. This is to have small visions that turn into a large vision, that is, for small visions to accumulate and become a complete vision. A person who first sees a complete vision still needs to see small visions, and a person who first sees small visions will eventually see the complete vision.</p>
<p>Whether a person sees a complete vision or a small vision, he needs to enjoy and experience what he has seen. We must experience the Christ whom we have seen. Paul saw a complete vision, and then little by little, day by day, he experienced that vision in his daily living. Unlike Paul, who had a full knowledge of Christ, we tend to see small visions. But if we faithfully follow what we have fellowshipped in this chapter, that is, turn what we read and hear into prayer, we will come to the full knowledge of Christ.</p>
<p>Hence, the end result of seeing the complete vision first is the same as the end result of seeing small visions first. Either way, we enjoy Christ every day. The practical way to enjoy Christ is to read and pray the Bible, daily reading the Word and digesting it by prayer. Those who practice this will surely come to the full knowledge of Christ. Their knowledge will not merely be in their mind but also in their spirit. May the Lord have mercy on us and grant us adequate practice in reading and praying over the Bible to touch and enjoy Christ.</p>
