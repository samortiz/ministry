   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. The Spirit of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 8:9 says, "But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 9, 10, and 11 of Romans 8 are concerned with the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit of Christ in verse 9 has the element of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This Spirit is the Spirit of God mentioned in the same verse and also the Spirit of life mentioned in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Spirit we have Christ's incarnation, humanity, human living, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is revealed by the different titles of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the Spirit did not contain the elements of incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, why would He be called the Spirit of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, if the Spirit did not contain the element of resurrection, why would He be called the Spirit of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, if the Spirit did not contain the divine life, why would He be called the Spirit of life?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The titles of the Spirit denote certain facts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, based on the titles of the Spirit used in the New Testament, we can say that in the Spirit of Jesus we have incarnation, humanity, human living, suffering, and crucifixion, and in the Spirit of Christ we have resurrection, the power of resurrection, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>G. The Spirit of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Philippians 1:19 Paul speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Christ: "For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Paul wrote this word, he was in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But even though he was a prisoner, he could rejoice because he had the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He enjoyed the Spirit of Jesus, the suffering One, and the Spirit of Christ, the resurrected One.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This Spirit supplied and supported Paul in his suffering and enabled him to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, Paul could say in Philippians 1:20 and 21, "According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death; for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE, PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When all the aspects and elements of the Spirit are put together we have a totality, a final product known in the New Testament as "the Spirit" Rom 8:16, 23, 26, 27; Gal 3:14; 5:16-18, 22, 25; 1 Pet 1:2; Rev 2:7; 14:13; 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This wonderful Spirit eventually becomes so simple in title!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is simple in title but full of divine elements for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is now the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, indwelling Spirit who is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have seen that at the time of John 7:39, the Spirit was "not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That was before the Lord Jesus was crucified and glorified in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But now we who believe in Christ may fulfill our destiny of enjoying the Spirit, and this Spirit will become rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to John 7:38 and 39, the Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, will become rivers of living water flowing out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that in our experience the one Spirit becomes many rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the enjoyment of the Spirit.</S>
