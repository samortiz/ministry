   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CHRISTIAN S LIVING, PATH, AND EVERYTHING COMING FROM THE SHINING AND BURNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During China s War of Resistance against Japan, I was imprisoned by the Japanese for preaching the gospel in Northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While I was in prison, I prayed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Japanese put me into a cell together with a Greek man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This man belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church, and we enjoyed our conversations very much.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When he asked me why I had been imprisoned, I told him that I had been imprisoned for preaching Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, he respected me very much and asked me to pray with him regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Twenty days later he was released, and I was left alone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On that day I knelt down to pray by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once I knelt down, the eyes in heaven shone on me like a beam of light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Tears fell from my eyes, and a hymn welled up within me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As I began to sing, I felt that the Lord was right there with me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I was inwardly connected to the heavens, and I did not have any feeling of loneliness or suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time, even though I was in prison, I was full of praises and joy as though I were in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This experience was not the result of someone exhorting or teaching me; rather, it was the result of God in heaven shining into me through His Spirit, His eyes, to motivate me with the light and energy of His fire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the source of a Christian s living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A Christian does not live by outward imitation but by the shining of the Spirit of God into him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can say that this shining is the eyes, the lamps, the fire, or the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In short, God is the Spirit, and He is also a consuming fire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When He comes to us, the first thing He does is to look at us with His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He sees us, He shines on us, when He shines on us, He burns us, and when He burns us, He motivates us within.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is spiritual reality, and this is the Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the past there was a female preacher in China whose name was Dora Yu.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When she was around twenty years old, she decided to study medicine in England.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the day that her ship was approaching Marseilles, the Spirit of God reached her and burned in her.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She sensed a voice within her, saying, Go back!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Go back!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not go to England to study medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The year that this happened was toward the end of the Ching Dynasty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time, for a young lady who had been sent by her parents to England to study medicine to have such a feeling in the middle of her voyage was unthinkable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, she said to the captain, I must land.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I will not go to England.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Upon hearing this, the captain asked her, What are you going to do when you go back to China?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She replied, I have to go back to China to preach Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ship had to continue its voyage, so they landed her in France, and from there she went back to China.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When her family came to pick her up, they thought that she must have returned because she was ill.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they found that she was not sick, they scolded her.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In response she told them, There was a fire burning in me; the Holy Spirit was moving in me continually, urging me to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No matter how much she explained, however, her parents still did not understand, and no matter how strongly her parents persuaded her, she could not be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since her parents had no way to change her, they told her out of anger, If Jesus wants you to preach Him, that is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We will go back home.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You stay in Shanghai alone, and let Jesus take care of feeding you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After her parents left her, Dora Yu was alone by herself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As she was looking to God, He opened the way for her and prepared a flat for her on Broadway in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was there that she began to preach the gospel, and from that time on God greatly used her.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who were in Shanghai in 1948 testified that following Dora Yu s preaching every row of chairs in both the chapel and the hallway would be wet because of people s tears.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many wept, repented, and were saved by her preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In those days few in China preached concerning regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Dora Yu may have been the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today in Christianity there are many great servants of God who were saved through her preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When God works in man, He looks into man s inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God s eyes are His lamps of fire, and when these lamps of fire shine within a person, there is a burning within him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This burning is the moving of the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is God Himself, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The living, the path, and everything of a Christian come from this burning.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They do not come from the teaching without but from this burning within.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is spiritual reality.</S>
