   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: As unsaved people, we lived the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now that we are saved, we live the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This seems to indicate that the old man is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can we say that our old man, the soul, still remains as an organ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 6 and 7 reveal that our old man was not only crucified with Christ, but also buried with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can our soul, our old man, come back to be the organ of our new man?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Answer: We should not forget that Romans 6 does not stop at burial but goes on to resurrection vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The crucified person was buried and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The natural faculties of our soul were crucified and buried, but they also were resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We now have the faculties of our soul in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The soul as an organ of our new man, the spirit, is not in its natural condition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is in a resurrected condition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our natural man, our natural being, has been uplifted in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our humanity has been crucified, buried, and uplifted by Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Question: As we have been crucified, buried, and resurrected, what was resurrected concerning us?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Answer: Before we were saved, our mind was very dull and foolish; our emotion was unrestricted and unbridled; and our will was either very stubborn or very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, after we received Christ, He did not only regenerate our spirit, but He also uplifted our mind, emotion, and will through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His resurrection immediately uplifted the natural faculties of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since we are saved persons, our mind, emotion, and will are surely different from the past.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because we have been grafted into Christ, we are growing together with Christ, and the faculties of our soul are continuing to be uplifted and enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 6:5 says, "For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To "have grown together with Him" is "to have an organic union in which the growth takes place that one partakes of the life and characteristics of the other.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is grafting Rom 11:24 that: 1 discharges all our negative elements; 2 resurrects our faculties created by God; 3 uplifts our faculties; 4 enriches our faculties; and 5 saturates our entire being to transform us" Rom 6:5, note 1 Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>See also Rom 6:5, note 2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>. Question: My concept has been that the life of the soul and the faculties of the soul are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The life of the soul needs to be denied, but the faculties of the soul, including the mind, emotion, and will, need to be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is this an accurate understanding?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Answer: The life of the soul is the person, whereas the faculties of the soul are the soul as an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The soul is the organ, and the faculties of the soul are the abilities of this organ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is better to say that we have the person of the soul and the organ of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Question: Our spirit contains the Spirit of Christ, who is a person with a mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can we say that we do not have these faculties in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Answer: Our spirit today is the new man, and in this new man, in this spirit, we have Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ does have the faculties of loving, thinking, and deciding.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the faculties of Christ are spiritual faculties, that is, they are the faculties of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These divine faculties of Christ could only be manifested indirectly through our faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The faculty of Christ's thinking is never expressed directly by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is always expressed through our mind 1 Cor 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Adam was created according to God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many Bible teachers define the image of God as the faculties of God to love, hate, and think.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God loves, so we love; God hates, so we hate; God is very thoughtful, so we are thoughtful also.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have the image of God, yet this image remains empty without any content until we receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we were without God, we exercised our minds in an empty way without God as the content in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But when we receive God, God becomes our content.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's thinking becomes the content of our mind, and His love becomes the content of our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A glove is a good illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The glove has five fingers, but these five fingers only have the image of the fingers, not the reality of the fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the hand enters into the glove, then the fingers of the hand become the content of the fingers of the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our mind, emotion, and will are just the fingers of the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When Christ comes into us with His mind, emotion, and will, His faculties become the very content of our human mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not many Christians understand these details of the spiritual life, but we need a vision of these details so that we can be those who live Christ.</S>
