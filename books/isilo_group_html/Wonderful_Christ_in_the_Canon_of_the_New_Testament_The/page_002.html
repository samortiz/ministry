<h1 class="title">THE SEED, THE ROOT, THE BRANCH,<br />
AND THE FRUIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 3:15; 22:18; 2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Isa. 4:2; 11:1-2, 10; 53:2; Jer. 23:5-6; Zech. 6:12-13; Matt. 1:17, 20-21, 23; 16:13-17; 18:20; 28:19-20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A WONDERFUL PERSON WITH WONDERFUL NAMES</h2>
<p>The Bible is a wonderful book with a wonderful person. We should never consider this divine book as being wonderful in anything else. Some think that the Bible is wonderful in doctrines and teachings. We do admit there are good teachings in this wonderful book. But we must all realize that it is wonderful because it portrays to us a wonderful person. This wonderful person is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I am afraid that we know far too little about this wonderful person. There is no need for me to mention His depth and His unsearchable riches. Simply His name is wonderful!</p>
<p>Many of us do not know anything about His name. Have you ever heard that Jesus is called the Branch? &ldquo;And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The Branch; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord&rdquo; (Zech. 6:12). This is one of the wonderful names of Jesus. Along with the branch, Jesus is called another name in Jeremiah: &ldquo;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS&rdquo; (Jer. 23:5-6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED OF WOMAN</h2>
<p>Jesus also has another name: the Seed of a Woman. This is seen in Genesis 3:15. &ldquo;And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why is Jesus called the Seed of Woman? To see this we must realize that in order to fulfill His purpose God created man as the center of the universe. It is not a small thing that we have been created in God&rsquo;s image. Adam was made in the image of God. But God said that it was not good for man to be alone. So He took a part of the man and built this part into a woman. This is God&rsquo;s economy. Many times those of us who are husbands wish that we did not have a wife. Yet, on the other hand, we simply cannot go on without a wife. God&rsquo;s economy destines us in this way. Hence, God prepared a wife for man.</p>
<p>But not long after God made a help meet for man, Satan entered. He did not make his first approach to mankind through the man, but through the woman. The husband may be likened to the front door, and the wife to the back door. He came in from the woman&rsquo;s direction, not from the man&rsquo;s. This may seem terrible, but it is really wonderful.</p>
<p>Forty years ago I heard a message by Brother Watchman Nee in which he said that in the entire universe God has an enemy, who may be likened to a mouse running loose in our house. How can we get rid of him? The best way is to set a trap. With the trap, there is always a little door. The door to the trap is the woman. The trap-maker made the door. Then one day Satan came into mankind through this door. He thought that he had captured man, but God had caught the enemy in a trap. This is why in Genesis 3 God told the enemy that the seed of the woman would bruise his head.</p>
<p>So eventually we see that the woman is not so bad. Eventually she is glorious. Though Satan came in through the woman, the Seed who would bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head also came in through the woman. Hallelujah! Jesus was not the seed of a man; He was the seed of a woman. All the sisters should be proud of this. Since the day Jesus came in through woman, there is the wonderful story of woman in the New Testament. Not long ago I fellowshipped with the sisters in Los Angeles about the six Marys recorded in the New Testament. Of course, the first Mary was the woman through whom Jesus was born. With Mary there is the seed of woman, and Jesus&rsquo; name is her seed.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Wonderful Christ in the Canon of the New Testament &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
