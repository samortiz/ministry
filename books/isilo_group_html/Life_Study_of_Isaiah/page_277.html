For Making the Many Righteous,<br>Who Will Know Him as the Righteous One</H2><P>Isaiah 53:11b says that Christ will make the many righteous, who will know Him as the righteous One. Today as long as a person would say, "Lord Jesus, You are the righteous One," this righteous One will enter into him to make him righteous. This is not merely to justify us objectively but to make us righteous subjectively, to live in us and live out of us to make us righteous. This is a subjective righteousness produced from within us, not by us but by Christ as the resurrection life living in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. As the Life of the Believers,<br>Being All the Members and in All the Members<br>of the New Man</H2><P>As the life of the believers, the resurrected Christ is all the members and in all the members of the new man (Col. 3:10-11). Before Christ's resurrection the life-giving Spirit, the firstborn Son of God, the Firstborn from the dead, the many sons of God, the many grains, the church, the Body of Christ, the new creation, and the new man did not exist. All these items were produced through Christ's resurrection.</P><P>As one of the items produced through Christ's resurrection, the new man is God's new creation, that is, the church. This new man carries out God's New Testament economy according to God's good pleasure.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_276.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_278.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 277</div><br></body></html>
