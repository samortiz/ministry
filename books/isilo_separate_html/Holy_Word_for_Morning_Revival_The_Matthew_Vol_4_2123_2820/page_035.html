Now, for God&#8217;s economy of the New Testament the disciples needed to go to the mountain again. Only on the high level of a mountain can we see clearly the New Testament economy.</p><p>Because all authority was given to Him (v. 18), the heavenly King sent His disciples to disciple all the nations. They go with His authority. To disciple the nations is to make the heathen the kingdom people for the establishing of His kingdom, which is the church, even today, on this earth.... Notice [in verse 19] that the Lord did not charge the disciples to preach the gospel, but to disciple the nations....To disciple the nations is to cause the Gentiles to become the kingdom people. We have been sent by the Lord not only to bring people to salvation, but also to disciple the nations. This is a matter of the kingdom. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 826-828)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>19<sup>1</sup> Baptism brings the repentant people out of their old state into a new one by terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ that they may become the kingdom people. John the Baptist&#8217;s recommending ministry began with a preliminary baptism, a baptism by water only. Now, after the heavenly King had accomplished His ministry on earth, had passed through the process of death and resurrection, and had become the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God. This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water and the invisible aspect by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38, 41; 10:44-48)....The disciples baptized the new converts (Acts 2:38) not only into water but also into the death of Christ (Rom. 6:3-4), into Christ Himself (Gal. 3:27), into the Triune God (v. 19), and into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13)....Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord here baptizes people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>19<sup>2</sup> Into indicates union, as in Rom. 6:3 and Gal. 3:27. The same Greek word is used in Acts 8:16; 19:5; and 1 Cor. 1:13, 15. To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into spiritual and mystical union with Him.</p><p>19<sup>3</sup> There is one name for the Divine Trinity. The name is the sum total of the Divine Being, equivalent to His person. To baptize someone into the name of the Triune God is to immerse him into all that the Triune God is.</p><p>20<sup>1</sup> ...Among the four Gospels the Lord&#8217;s ascension is recorded only in Mark (Mark 16:19) and Luke (Luke 24:51). John testifies that the Lord, as the Son of God, even God Himself, is life to His believers. As such, He can never and would never leave them. Matthew proves that He, as Emmanuel, is the heavenly King who is with His people continuously until He comes back. Hence, in John and Matthew the Lord&#8217;s ascension is not mentioned.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 826-831; Hymns: #608, #7</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
