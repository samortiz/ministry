   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Exercising to Speak Wisely</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When you go door-knocking, you have to pay attention to your attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You should never be reckless or hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, you should be modest, courteous, gentle, respectful, dignified, and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, when you speak, you should learn to be concise instead of being wordy and to be affectionate instead of being cold.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you are too wordy and mechanical, people may close their door immediately or find an excuse to reject you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, you have to exercise to speak straightforwardly, directly, affectionately, and politely.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If they answer, I do not have time, you should not give up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, you should say, It will take you just one minute.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, the person may be saved and baptized because of this one-minute gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is because we have had this kind of experience that we practice the one-minute gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if you have learned all the truths, a person whom you visit by knocking on his door will not be able to discern that.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if you take out a book and open it to read with him, his attitude will instantly become more respectful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This also was one of the results of our experiment in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Anything that is printed in a volume or published as a book is something that is not common.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Words that are trivial will not be printed in a book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It does not matter who the person is or how high his speaking skill is, no one can speak as neatly and concisely as a book.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The words used in our books have been considered over and over again during the course of writing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the wording and the phrasing are clearer and more concise.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One co-worker told me, I found out that while door-knocking, especially on the college campuses, it is useless to speak our own words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more efficient way is to read our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes I simply open up the Recovery Version and ask the person to read a paragraph of a footnote, and he gets saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also uses the life-studies from time to time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He simply opens them for the person to read a section, and the person gets saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The words of the footnotes in our Recovery Version are refined and pure, and they are also the crucial truths.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some of the sections in our life-studies are also very important.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to learn to use these.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The booklet The Mystery of Human Life has also been greatly used by the Lord in this year.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe that the total print quantity of this booklet in all the localities is about one million copies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, we also have to learn to use this booklet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While using it, do not be wordy; furthermore, the shorter the time you take the better.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, you should memorize the four main sections.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first section is on God s creation, the second section is on man s fall, the third section is on Christ s redemption, and the fourth section is on God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While you are reading with someone, do not read from the beginning to the end in a dead and rigid way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You need to learn to follow the Spirit s leading within you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you sense you need to read a certain section, then turn to that section and read it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not read too much; if you read too much, you will lose the Lord in the reading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A sales person once told me that the technique to making sales is not to speak too much.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just speak a few sentences that are clear and concise, and then draw the person to say, Very good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once you hear this word, you should immediately say, Very good; please buy one! and take out your order book.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because he has already said it is good, he will be reluctant to refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Learning to Grasp the Opportunity</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A brother once testified that the person he visited said that his speaking was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I instructed those present that this was the right moment to tie the knot and lead that person to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If that person would pray, he would believe and receive the Lord, and then the brother should baptize him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, if he would not grasp the opportunity but would continue to talk, the opportunity may slip away, and he would not be able to close the deal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, some brothers present said, We are afraid that this is too fast; we are still strangers to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such a consideration means that it is not the new one who is not willing to pray, but it is you who are not willing to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not that he is not willing to lose his face, but it is you who are not willing to lose your face in leading the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am speaking these things from my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was the same with me in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I went to lead someone to the Lord, often at the critical juncture I did not have the boldness to lead him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead, I kept thinking that it might be too early and that I should not take the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once I lost the opportunity, though, I may have lost it for my whole life; I may never have had the opportunity to see him again.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brother Nee once told us that gospel preachers have to be thick-skinned.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who are thin-skinned cannot lead people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Perhaps some brothers and sisters would say, If this is the case, then since I am such a thin-skinned person, I may as well forget about going out to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You may do so as long as you have the peace, but everyone else will still continue to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the past, when I saw strangers, I would start sweating, and my face would turn red.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every time my mother wanted to invite people to our home, I would be the first one to object because I did not like to meet strangers, and I disliked even more going to other people s homes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, when I had to preach the gospel to others and lead them to pray at the end, I could not relax my face or open my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Later the Lord arranged the environment and forced me into a situation in which I had to stand and speak from the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It does not matter if you are thin-skinned; as long as you are willing to practice, willing to go visit by door-knocking, slowly you will have the boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the other hand, while you are door-knocking, you must learn the technique of grasping the opportunity to lead a person to believe and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Immediately after he prays, you should show him Romans 10:13, which says, For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then say to him, My friend, congratulations!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You are saved!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The next thing is to lead him to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Before October of 1984, I did not thoroughly study the Bible regarding the most appropriate way of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christianity has unceasingly debated the two ways of baptism baptism by immersion or baptism by sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Baptism by immersion is to put the entire person into the water, whereas baptism by sprinkling is merely to drop some water on the person.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Bible speaks only about the need for baptism, but it does not emphasize the method of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After one and a half years of door-knocking, our study has shown us that the important matter is not how we baptize people but how to baptize people at the opportune time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Sometimes the person we visit has already believed and received the Lord; he has already prayed to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In this case we must baptize him immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we insist on a method, such as bringing him to the meeting hall s baptistery to be baptized, then before we reach the meeting hall, he probably will have changed his mind and made up excuses to not be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There have been times when some people already had arrived at the meeting hall to be baptized; however, when they were about to change their clothes, they rejected the idea and ran away.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, you have to carry out the baptism while the iron is still hot.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Once you see the opportunity, you should grasp it and baptize people.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There are many new and modern apartment buildings in Taipei where there is a big bathtub in the bathroom, and the temperature of the water is easily managed to be hot or cold.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As long as there is the opportunity for baptism, the sisters can go fill the tub with water while others are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then after the prayer, the brothers can baptize the person.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Sometimes the bathtub is big enough only for the lower part of the body to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In that case we can pour water on the upper part.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This kind of baptism by half immersion and half pouring is also convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Hence, do not pay attention to the form but rather to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Exercising to Continue Steadfastly</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Beginning from this August, the saints who are coming to join the Full-time Training in Taipei will include almost five hundred from Taiwan, close to one hundred fifty from America, twenty or more from Europe, and a few from South America and Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Thus, the number of trainees will be well over six hundred fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Including twenty to thirty language class teachers, the total will be over seven hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This time the training has one regulation, that is, that the trainees have to go out and visit people two mornings a week and also visit the community and college campuses every afternoon and on the evenings when there are no scheduled meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Each of the seven hundred trainees should baptize at least one person per week.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In this way, two thousand eight hundred people will be baptized in just a few weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I hope that from now on not only the full-time trainees but also each elder and co-worker will practice door-knocking and visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is the first item we should practice.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Maybe we cannot go out to knock on doors every day, but one thing we can do is spend two to three hours each week for door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We should visit not only those whom we know but also those we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should knock on all the doors in the district in which we live.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Do not worry or be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>As long as we are willing to do it, we will be successful.</S>
