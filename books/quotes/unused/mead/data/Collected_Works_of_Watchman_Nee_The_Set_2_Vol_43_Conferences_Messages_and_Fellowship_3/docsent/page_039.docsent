   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVERYONE KNOWING GOD DIRECTLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT AGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the New Testament age?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is when "the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah,/As the waters cover the sea" Isa 11:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You can go to God and inquire of Him directly; there is no need for your brothers to tell you anything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You can know God's will yourself, and there is no need to turn to other men to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, there is no need to have your neighbor be your prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone can know God's will directly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I receive countless letters every year asking me questions and requesting that I pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They want to know whether God wants them to do this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are saying, in effect, "Watchman Nee is the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We no longer have to inquire of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can just ask Watchman Nee to do it for us."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brothers and sisters, this is the principle of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the principle of a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Does this then mean that we do not have to listen to our brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No. In the Old Testament age, men listened only to their brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament age, Christians should listen to their brothers, but they also have to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am not saying that we should ignore our brothers or the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am saying that we must have the leading of the Holy Spirit in addition to these things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thank God that Moses and Elijah are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no need for others to tell us what is God's will, for we know within.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Holy Spirit within us will tell us what we should or should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not have the leading of the Holy Spirit, we can wait for the prophets to give us the word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is a prophet?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A prophet is a person who finds out God's will for us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There was a time when I did not understand why Paul had to go up to Jerusalem Acts 21:4, 10-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people discouraged him, yet he still went.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why did he have to go?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now I know.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul had to go because he had to preserve the New Testament principle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the New Testament age, no one should be another person's prophet!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is true that all the brothers and sisters have the Holy Spirit and can prophesy through His inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But no one needed to tell Paul what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul should have known in himself whether or not he should go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those people did one thing more than was necessary they became Paul's prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why Paul ignored their word and went according to his plan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Had Paul followed their word and turned back and had such a history been recorded in the Bible, we would have a terrible case on our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul was willing to sacrifice himself to maintain the principle of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This shows us that today the law and the prophets are over.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our faith there is only the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot have the law and the prophets in addition to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord within us tells us what we should and should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many times when others ask me questions, I say, "Just ask yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every saved person should understand God's will by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps our confused thoughts and feelings and our complicated mind have shut us off from the voice of the Lord and the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If our heart is pure we will see God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those with a pure heart see God Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But whatever our condition may be, we must always remember that a Christian is one who listens to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can only receive revelation directly from God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot have the law or the prophets in addition to this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>May the Lord guide us to learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must first receive revelation from the Holy Spirit before we can understand God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only then will we have a living testament and not a dead testament.</S>
