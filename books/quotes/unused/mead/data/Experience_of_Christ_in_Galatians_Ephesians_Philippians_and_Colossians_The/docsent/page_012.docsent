   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST LIVING IN US AND WE BEING IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The purpose of the book of Galatians is to reveal that we need to experience Christ in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nothing can please God but Christ experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ must be not only righteousness but everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Galatians, Christ must first be revealed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then this Christ must live in us 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are familiar with these verses, but we may not pay attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do we really mean business that Christ has been revealed in us and is now living in us?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only so, we have put on Christ, just as we put on a garment 3:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That we have put on Christ means that we are put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ has been put into us, He is being revealed in us as our life, and we have been put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is like a garment covering us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>CHRIST BEING FORMED IN US</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition, Christ must be formed in us 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may use a glove to illustrate the matter of being formed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we put our hand into a glove, the hand is in the glove but it is not formed in the glove until all the fingers are fixed in place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Gradually the thumb fits in place, and then the second, third, fourth, and fifth fingers; finally the entire hand is formed in the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ must be fully, thoroughly, wholly mingled with us in all our inward parts in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may have Christ in us only in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have Christ in our spirit as our life, but we may not have Christ in our mind as our thought.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We also may not have Christ in our emotions as our love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ must even be our hate; we need to hate certain things by Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also must have Christ in our will as our decision and choice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ must be everything in our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He must be mingled with us in every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then He will be formed in us, and we will be conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that we will be absolutely one with Him, not only in life and nature but also in form, expression, and image.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ must be subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In more than one place, people have criticized our hymn that says, "Christ to me is so subjective" Hymns, #537 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people do not have the concept that Christ is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once when I had trouble with my car, a brother tried to explain the problem to me, but I could not understand all the mechanical terms.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I simply took the car to a garage and let someone do the talking for me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today too many Christians are like this concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To speak about Christ being the life-giving Spirit causes havoc.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They say, "Jesus Christ is the Lord and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Don't say anything beyond this."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the poor situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today I still do not drive a car, because in order to drive I must understand things about the car.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the same way, in order to be a good, normal Christian, we have to know the details of who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ must be revealed in us, He must live in us, we have to put Him on, and He must be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>BEARING THE BRANDS OF JESUS AND CARING ONLY FOR THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition, we should bear the brands of Jesus and care for neither circumcision nor uncircumcision 6:17, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not care about being religious or unreligious.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We care for only one thing: the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Who or what is the new creation?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is Christ in our spirit to be experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the principle of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to apply these things to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are we persons like Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people in today's Christianity pay attention to something other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am afraid some of us are also this way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may say that we do not pay attention to the gifts, but we may still pay attention to something else other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to be delivered from so many other things.</S>
