   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RAPTURE OF THE OVERCOMING BELIEVERS Being Filled with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 17:31-36 the Lord indicates that the kingdom of God is related to Him and the rapture of His overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that even the rapture of the believers is part of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In fact, the rapture is also the Savior Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can understand this if we realize that if we did not have Christ within us, we could never be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The rapture in which we shall participate will be Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we have Christ in us to a sufficient degree, we shall be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may compare ourselves to a balloon and the indwelling Christ to the air that fills the balloon.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more a balloon is filled with air, the more it will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a similar way, in order to be raptured, we need to be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The rapture, therefore, is a matter of being filled with Christ to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By the time of the rapture, the air, the indwelling Christ, will rapture us, the balloon filled with this air, this pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Warning concerning Lot s Wife</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The overcomers do not seek to preserve their soul life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In view of the warning concerning Lot s wife, they do not love or care for material things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 31 says, In that day, he who shall be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he who is in the field, likewise, let him not turn back to the things behind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse reveals that lingering in the earthly and material things will cause us to miss the overcomers rapture described in verses 34 through 36.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 32 the Lord says, Remember Lot s wife.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lot s wife became a pillar of salt because she took a lingering, backward look at Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That look indicated that she loved and treasured the evil world which God was about to judge and utterly destroy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She was rescued from Sodom, but she did not reach the safe place that Lot reached Gen 19:15-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She did not perish; neither was she fully saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Like the salt which becomes tasteless Luke 14:34-35 , she was left in a place of suffering shame.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a solemn warning to world-loving believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lot s wife was rescued from Sodom by angels, but her heart was still in that evil city.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the angels had brought forth Lot and his wife, they said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed Gen 19:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lot and his wife were charged to go forward and not look back.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sodom was altogether under God s condemnation and was about to be consumed, and they should forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, unable to forget the city of Sodom, Lot s wife had a lingering look backward at the city, and immediately she became a pillar of salt: But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt Gen 19:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The warning concerning Lot s wife is related to the warning concerning tasteless salt in Luke 14:34 and 35.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we put together 14:34 and 35 and 17:32, we see that a person who belongs to the Lord may become tasteless salt, even a pillar of tasteless salt.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may say that Lot s wife had salt, but the salt had lost its flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What a shame!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have seen that in 14:35 salt may be in one of three locations: the soil, the manure pile, or a place outside, neither in the soil nor in the manure pile.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the case of Lot s wife, there are also three locations: the city of Sodom, the place where Lot was taken, and the place in between, a location of shame, where Lot s wife remained as a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not many Christian leaders and teachers have seen this third location.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Most teach that there are only two locations, a place for the saved and a place for the lost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But according to the New Testament revelation, there is definitely a third location.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not the location of the saved nor the location of the lost; it is a location of suffering shame.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we love the Lord and are warned by the case of Lot s wife, we shall not care for material things or set our hearts on them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of preserving our soul by loving material things, we shall be filled up with Christ as the heavenly air.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we shall rise in rapture.</S>
