<h1 class="title">THE SECOND FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO ESCAPE THE FURTHER FALL</h2>
<p>After man&rsquo;s first fall, there was a dealing from God and a promise. After man&rsquo;s second fall, there was no dealing from God, but there was a way for man to escape this further fall. Genesis 4 shows how Cain and his descendants fell, and it shows how another group of people escaped the fall. In chapter 3 there is only one group of people, but in chapter 4 there are two groups: Cain and his descendants, and Abel and those who succeeded Abel.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 mentions many people who were on the line of Cain, and it also mentions three other persons&mdash;Abel, Seth, and Enosh&mdash;who were not on the line of the fall.</p>
<p>We need to consider how Abel&rsquo;s group escaped the fall while Cain fell. The fall that began with Adam and continued with Cain went on at an increasingly fast pace. However, Abel, Seth, and Enosh were not in the fall, because they found a way out and lived in this way</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO ESCAPE<br />
IN LIGHT OF MAN&rsquo;S SECOND FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Following One&rsquo;s Own Will</h2>
<p>In order to find the way to escape the fall, we need to consider those who were in Cain&rsquo;s group. They fell because they followed their own will. Hence, the first step in escaping the fall is to not follow our own will. After man fell, Satan entered into him. Hence, the element of Satan is in man&rsquo;s self with his opinions and ideas. When man follows his own will, he is following Satan and continuing in the fall. Hence, in order to escape the fall, man must reject his own will, deny his own will, and not walk according to his own will.</p>
<p>Even though Cain walked according to his own will, he did not begin to fall further by committing a great sin; rather, he was attempting to serve God. A similar situation can be found in Matthew 16. Peter loved the Lord, and when he heard that the Lord would die, he was concerned about the Lord. Hence, he took the Lord aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, &ldquo;God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; (v. 22). Apparently, Peter was not opposing the Lord; he was expressing his love for the Lord. However, the Lord turned and said to Peter, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan!&rdquo; (v. 23). We need to see the significance of this. We should not think that we are walking according to our own will only when we commit sins or do something evil. We may walk according to our own will even in loving the Lord. It was not a sin for Peter to love the Lord, but Satan was hidden in Peter. The Lord did not say, &ldquo;Peter, you are following Satan.&rdquo; Instead, the Lord said, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men&rdquo; (v. 23). The Lord&rsquo;s word shows that Satan is in man&rsquo;s thoughts. Setting our mind on the things of men is setting our mind on Satan, and walking according to our own will is following Satan. Therefore, the first step in escaping from the fall is to deny the self.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word concerning denying the self in verse 24 means that we must deny our opinions, thoughts, and intents, because Satan is hidden in them. In Genesis 3 Satan was in the serpent. In chapter 4 he was not hiding in something outside of man, but he was in man&rsquo;s opinions. Human opinions are the embodiment of Satan. Hence, when a person follows his opinions, he is following Satan. In order to overcome Satan&rsquo;s stratagem and to escape from the fall, we must deny the self and not follow our will.</p>
<p>In chapter 4 both Cain and Abel served God and presented an offering to God. Cain offered the fruit of his labor from the ground, but Abel killed lambs from his flock and offered them to God. Cain&rsquo;s offering was based on his own view; it lacked God&rsquo;s revelation. Abel&rsquo;s offering was according to God&rsquo;s revelation, not according to a method that he had conceived.</p>
<p>When Adam and Eve fell, they saw the shame from sin in themselves. Therefore, they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths to cover their shame (3:7). Making loincloths to cover their shame was something according to their opinion and method. However, God showed them the way of redemption by killing a lamb. The lamb died, and its blood was shed on their behalf. When God made coats of skin to cover their shame, Adam and Eve no longer had fear or shame. They must have been deeply impressed that even though they were fallen and sinful, they could live before God in boldness without a sense of shame and without a need for their own work. The loincloths that they made out of leaves could not cover their shame or give their conscience boldness before God. Only a sacrifice that died and shed its blood could give their conscience peace before God, and only the skin of that sacrifice could cover their shame. This must have deeply impressed them.</p>
<p>After Adam and Eve had children, they must have told their children how God created them, placed them in front of the tree of life, and warned them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They must have told their children how they violated this command and offended God. They must have told their children of the fear and guilt that they had felt within and how they had used their own method to cover their shame. They must have told their children of their hatred of the serpent and how God cursed the serpent and promised that a seed of woman would deal with him. And they must have told their children how God killed a sacrifice, shed its blood, and made coats of skin to cover their shame so that they could live before Him in boldness. Adam and Eve must have repeatedly told their children these things. They may be considered the first ones to preach the gospel. Hebrews 11:4 says, &ldquo;By faith Abel offered to God.&rdquo; Romans 10:14 says, &ldquo;How shall they believe into Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without one who proclaims Him?&rdquo; Because Abel offered a sacrifice by faith to God, he must have heard the story of God&rsquo;s provision of a sacrifice for man from his parents.</p>
<p>Both Cain and Abel heard the gospel, but Cain did not believe. He put aside what he heard from his parents and refused to take the way that God had shown. In offering to God the fruit of his labor, the produce of the ground, he used his own method. The produce of the ground could not shed blood or pass through death. This means that Cain wanted to please God by his own conduct, work, and labor. He felt that he was good and that the fruit of his labor was something worthy that he could offer to God. He did not have any consciousness of sin; instead, he was proud of himself before God.</p>
<p>This was not the case with Abel. Abel heard the word of the gospel and believed. He knew that man was sinful and that human labor, conduct, and work could not please God. Because man is sinful, there is no forgiveness without the shedding of blood (Heb. 9:22). Therefore, Abel was humble, knowing that he was sinful and that only the blood of a vicarious sacrifice could please God. Cain&rsquo;s offering was according to his own will, without any regard for God&rsquo;s revelation and instruction. Abel&rsquo;s offering was according to God&rsquo;s gospel and revelation. His offering was not according to his own will. Hence, he was delivered from following his own will, which is the first step of Satan&rsquo;s stratagem to bring man into a further fall.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
