   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING SALVATION BY BEING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I appreciate the fact that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is even a hymn in our hymnal with this chorus:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ liveth in me,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ liveth in me;</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Oh! what a salvation this,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That Christ liveth in me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, simply to say that Christ lives in us is to be too objective.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also need to experience living in Christ and doing all things in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What a salvation it is to live in Him!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we live in Him, we shall enjoy His salvation day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This salvation can be compared to riding in a car.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as we remain in the car, we enjoy salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I ride in a car, I am not worried about what direction I am going or anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I may rest, pray, or enjoy sight-seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I simply rest and enjoy myself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In like manner, when we are in Christ, we should simply rest and enjoy ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should enjoy the life in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My burden in this message is that we would all learn the secret of being in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can do all things in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This may seem to be a small secret, but actually it has great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This secret is the way for us to experience Christ and to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is also the secret of having more of Christ accumulated within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>PRACTICING THE SECRET</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such a secret needs to be put into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to practice this secret, we firstly need to realize that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Secondly, we must deny the flesh and the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should count all things loss and not treasure or appreciate anything of our natural man, such as our humility or other virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All of our good points, attributes, and virtues need to be counted loss.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not have any confidence in anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thirdly, we should not do anything by ourselves, for we are not alone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Another person lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Marriage is an illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before we were married, we were alone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we wanted to open the window, we simply opened it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when we were married, we became bound and limited.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the wives are tied to their husbands, and all the husbands are tied to their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In my married life I certainly have learned to live by another person, by my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With Christ, we have another person, not married to us, but living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, many of us do not care for Christ's living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, it seems that we ourselves are everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we should be nothing, and let Him be everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all need to realize that we are no longer persons alone, but that we have another One living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, is living in us right now.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not merely have His life; we have Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we are no longer alone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now that He lives in us, we need to learn to live by Him and not by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Day after day may go by without our doing anything by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This indicates that we do not practice living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In our daily living we need to practice living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are about to visit the saints or show love, we need to check who is doing it, we or Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before we act, we should wait a while to see whether it is we or Christ who is acting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By doing this we allow the Christ who dwells in us to live for us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the practice of the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul had been instructed in this secret so that he knew both how to abound and how to be in want.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He could do all things in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is sufficient simply to be in Him, for He is all-inclusive and all-sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For example, as we ride in the car, we have complete trust in the car.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is more sufficient and more inclusive than any car.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, we should put our full trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whatever we do we should do in Him, not in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should do everything in Him and by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the secret Paul learned and the secret we need to learn today.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do not need more teaching, but more practice of this secret.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to practice doing everything in Him.</S>
