   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the creation of man, Lucifer or Satan came to induce man to rebel also.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Due to these two rebellions that of Satan with his angels and that of man the ruling and government of God has been greatly interrupted, tested, and attacked.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead of being under the rule and control of God, the earth has come under the rule and control of Satan and fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the earthly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By the time the Lord Jesus came to the earth at His incarnation, nearly the whole earth was the kingdom of the earth, controlled by Satan and by man.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's intention is to have the earth controlled by the heavens.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Lord Jesus came with the kingdom of the heavens, He was rejected by the Jewish people; so He turned to the Gentiles and established His church among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Within the church He brought all things under the control and government of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the church there is the heavenly rule and government, and there is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the period of the church age, however, the kingdom of the heavens, the heavenly rule, is not manifested in an open way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, it is a heavenly rule in a very mysterious and hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although it is not yet manifested, the reality of the heavenly rule is present.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the church at least some of the Christians are under the ruling of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With them there is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will subdue the whole world and the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdom of our Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The kingdom of the heavens will become the ruling power and will govern in a manifested, open way, not in a mysterious and hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now the kingdom of the heavens rules within the church in a hidden, mysterious way, but at that time the kingdom of the heavens will be fully manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The kingdom of the heavens simply means the heavenly rule and government.</S>
