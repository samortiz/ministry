<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REIGN OF AHAB OVER ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AND<br>THE REIGN OF JEHOSHAPHAT OVER JUDAH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 20:1&#151;22:50</H1><P>In this message we will continue to consider the reign of Ahab over Israel and then consider the reign of Jehoshaphat over Judah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Ahab's Dealing with Ben-hadad King of Syria</H2><P>In chapter twenty we have an account of Ahab's dealing with Ben-hadad king of Syria.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Ben-hadad's Insulting Challenge to Ahab</H2><P>Ben-hadad assembled all his army together and besieged Samaria and fought against it (v. 1). Then he issued an insulting challenge to Ahab (vv. 2-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Ahab Rejecting Ben-hadad</H2><P>Ahab called for all the elders of the land, and through their encouragement he rejected Ben-hadad (vv. 7-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Ahab Waging a War<br>against Ben-hadad and Winning It</H2><P>A certain prophet approached Ahab and said, "Thus says Jehovah, Have you seen all this great multitude? I am now delivering it into your hand today, and you will know that I am Jehovah" (v. 13). Encouraged by God's promise through the prophet, Ahab waged a war against Ben-hadad and won it (vv. 14-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Ahab Being Warned That Ben-hadad<br>Would Come Back to Attack Him the Next Year</H2><P>Ahab was warned by a prophet that Ben-hadad king of Syria would come back to attack him the next year (v. 22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Ben-hadad Reorganizing His Army<br>and Changing His Strategy</H2><P>Ben-hadad reorganized his army and changed his strategy to fight with Israel in the plain instead of on the mountains. Ben-hadad then came to attack Ahab, but he lost the battle and surrendered to Ahab to save his life. Ahab made a treaty with him and released him (vv. 23-34).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Ahab Being Rebuked<br>because He Had Released a Man<br>Whom God Had Devoted to Destruction</H2><P>Ahab was rebuked by a prophet in disguise because he had released a man whom God had devoted to destruction. God had decided to destroyed Ben-hadad, but Ahab released him without inquiring of God. Because of that, Ahab's life would be for that man's life and Ahab's people for that man's people (vv. 35-42).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Ahab Going to His House Sullen and Vexed</H2><P>After Ahab was rebuked by the prophet, he went to his house sullen and vexed (v. 43).</P>
