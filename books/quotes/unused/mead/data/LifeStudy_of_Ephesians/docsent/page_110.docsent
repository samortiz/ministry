   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CAPTURED BY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>More than nineteen centuries ago we were captured by Christ and put into His train of captives.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As those who have been captured by Him, we have no way to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we have never seen the Lord Jesus, we have no choice but to believe in Him because we have been captured by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now that we are in His train, we cannot get away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not only have we been captured by Christ, but He has also presented us to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After beholding us with great appreciation, the Father returned us to the Son as gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this way we all were made gifts to the Body through Christ s universal traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In His travels Christ died for our sins and accomplished all things for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He defeated Satan, and He released us from the enemy s usurping hand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once we were Satan s captives, but now we are Christ s captives, those who have been led in His train to the height of the universe, presented to the Father, and given back to the Son as gifts to men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the New Testament, we were saved before we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When people ask me when I was saved, I sometimes tell them that I was saved more than nineteen hundred years ago, at the time of Christ s crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We were redeemed in Christ s crucifixion, and we were regenerated in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even before Christ put us in His train of captives, we were already saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By the time He presented us to the Father, we had already been saved and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>GIFTS TO THE BODY AND TO MEN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we can see the steps by which sinners have become gifts to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These steps include Christ s incarnation, His human living, His death on the cross, His burial in the tomb, His descent into Hades, His resurrection from among the dead, and His ascension to the heavens to return to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By means of these steps we, the sinners, have become apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we are gifts to men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Wherever the Lord may send us in the days ahead, we shall be sent as gifts to the people there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only the leading apostles and prophets are gifts, but every member of the Body is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, my little finger is a gift to my body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It can do something for my body that no other member can do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>None of us should regard ourselves as too small to be a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes it is the smallest members who are the most useful and who render the greatest comfort to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we all are gifts given by Christ to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of Christ s universal traveling, we are no longer sinners, but sons of God, trophies to the Father, and gifts to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Ephesians 4 we see the giving of the gifts, whereas in Psalm 68 we have the receiving of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to Psalm 68, the Son received trophies from the Father as gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then in Ephesians 4 the Son gave them all as gifts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We, the saved ones, have been given not only to the church, but even to the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, wherever we may go, we shall be a great blessing to others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In some of the foregoing messages I have pointed out that all the saints can be today s apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this message I would like to point out that we also can be evangelists, those who preach the good news, those who proclaim the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we contact people in our daily living, we need to tell them the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are faithful to do this, we are evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are also shepherds and teachers, those who take care of others and instruct them in the way of the Lord and in the things concerning God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>NO CLERGY OR LAITY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesians 4:11 does speak of some apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps you are wondering how I can say that all the saints can be such gifts to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The gifts in 4:11 are the leading apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We, of course, cannot be these leading ones; however, as their followers, we can be the same kind of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I certainly do not consider myself an apostle like Paul, who was a leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But as a follower of Paul, I do regard myself as one of today s apostles, today s sent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all should have such a concept concerning ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all should be followers of the leading apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are not such followers, we shall fall into a great heresy the heresy of a clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We shall make the leading ones the clergy, and the followers will become the laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But in the church, the Body of Christ, there is no such thing as either clergy or laity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As gifts to the Body, we all are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As gifts given by Christ to the Body and to all mankind, we can be a great blessing to the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ephesians 4 tells us that grace is given according to the measure, the size, of the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The grace produces the gifted persons and then supplies them according to the measure of the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the gifted persons are for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the three items mentioned in verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In a later message we shall consider these items in detail.</S>
