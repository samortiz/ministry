   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Excommunication</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Two years after the church life began to be practiced in Watchman's home town in 1922, he was excommunicated by his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was excommunicated because he stood for the truth of the Lord's recovery and protested against the leading co-worker's being ordained by a denominational missionary.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Considering his dissent too pronounced, they excommunicated him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Excommunication is a very serious matter, and in this case it was done while he was away on a ministry trip.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most of the believers who met with them sided with him, but the Lord would not allow him to do anything to vindicate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That was really a suffering to the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. Dissension</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the time that Watchman began his work, he was in fellowship with an older sister.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She loved the Lord, sought the Lord, and was quite gifted of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Having gained the respect of Christians from several directions, she began to travel and preach.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She became one who continually dissented from Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In January 1934, while he was conducting the third overcomer conference in Shanghai, this sister was in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Watchman spoke, she would often shake her head.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was a suffering to him, and this was not the only case.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through the years, in the work and in the churches, this kind of dissension happened to him a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>C. Immaturity and Incompetency</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among those who worked with Watchman Nee and bore the responsibility with him in the church life, no one approached him in maturity and competency; all the others were immature and incompetent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Fifty years ago in China, Watchman was unique and extraordinary in his knowledge of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He went forward much further than all the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He saw many things the brothers did not see, and their immaturity and incompetency caused him a great deal of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. Stubbornness</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The stubbornness of the brothers also caused him to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One day a learned young man came into the meeting of the church in Shanghai and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He intended to go to the United States for further study.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, before leaving China, he desired to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Watchman was very clear concerning him and agreed that he should be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But an older co-worker disagreed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His reason was that this young man was too new.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He had come to the meetings only once or twice, and he was about to leave for the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a person should not be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He based his reason upon Watchman's own teaching that nothing should be done in the church life without fellowship, and his fellowship was that this brother should not be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He held stubbornly to this point concerning fellowship and used it to insist that the young man should not be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His concern was that the young man might not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Watchman told him that if to baptize the young man was a mistake, he would bear the full responsibility before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But still the co-worker stubbornly refused.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1933 Watchman began to realize that for the sisters not to pray in the prayer meetings of the church was a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He became convinced that it was proper for the sisters to pray in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the leading ones in the church at that time stubbornly kept the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That too grieved him.</S>
