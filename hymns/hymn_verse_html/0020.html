His word is the word of the truth of His gospel (Eph. 1:13), which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ (Acts 10:43); and the blood of Christ has fulfilled His righteous requirements that He might forgive us our sins (Matt. 26:28). If we confess our sins, He, according to His word and based on the redemption through the blood of Jesus, forgives us because He must be faithful in His word and righteous in the blood of Jesus; otherwise, He would be unfaithful and unrighteous. Our confession is needed for His forgiveness. Such forgiveness of God, which is for the restoration of our fellowship with Him, is conditional; it depends on our confession.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

Christ gave Himself up for us as both an offering, that we might have fellowship with God, and a sacrifice, that He might redeem us from sin.<br>See note 2<sup>4</sup>.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

This sin, which came out of the evil one, entered into man (Rom. 5:12) and made man not only a sinner but sin itself under God's judgment. Hence, when Christ became a man in the flesh (John 1:14), He was made sin (not sinful) on our behalf to be judged by God (Rom. 8:3) that we might become God's righteousness in Him.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

Christ's death was not merely a murder (Acts 7:52), nor was it a martyrdom; rather, it was carried out by God Himself according to His law. Thus, Christ died a vicarious death as the Substitute for sinners (1 Pet. 3:18), a death that was legal according to God's law and was recognized and approved by God according to the law.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

But Christ put away sin (9:26) by offering Himself to God as the one sacrifice for sins, whereupon He sat down forever on the right hand of God (v. 12). His sitting in heaven is a sign and proof that the removing of sins has been accomplished. His sitting there is forever. Hence, He no longer needs to do anything for sin. He did it once for all. His sitting down forever after having offered one sacrifice for sins is in contrast to the priests' standing daily to offer often the same sacrifices.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

His resurrection proves that God's requirements were satisfied by His death for us, that we are justified by God because of His death, and that in Him, the resurrected One, we are accepted before God. Furthermore, as the resurrected One, He is in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

Without forgiveness of sins there is no way for the requirement of God's righteousness to be fulfilled that the covenant may be enacted. But Christ's blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins, and the covenant was enacted with His blood (Matt. 26:28).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
