The brothers would also like to have the brothers and sisters who serve in various homes participate in this fellowship
Without a heart, a person will not want to do anything, and even if he does something, he will not be enthusiastic in doing it
If you want to do this work, you must like the young people, care for them, and be concerned about their affairs
Because they are naturally inclined to the young people and they enjoy contacting the young people, they come to do the young people's work
We can say that virtually everyone used by God to begin a new thing or chosen by God to turn the age was a young man
Not only is this shown in the Bible and confirmed in church history, but it is even seen in all of human society
There is no school that solely accepts elderly students, nor is there any training center established exclusively for old people
There may be a seventy-year-old brother here who truly loves the Lord, and you may want to spend some time to help him
You may have clearly explained something in the morning, but in the afternoon he asks, 'What is that all about'?
Twenty years from now those who will be useful to the Lord are those who are in their twenties or younger today
At that time we had left Christianity behind; therefore, even in the matter of how to meet we had to feel our way around little by little
If the Lord does not have a group of young people today to receive help, after some time, when we pass away, will there not be a gap?
From that time on we paid a great deal of attention to gaining the young intellectuals in the universities and hospitals
We can be sure that such a family does not have to sell its house the house will become someone elses house before long
If you see this, your heart will be burdened to love the young people regardless of whether they are good or bad
May the brothers and sisters as the Lord's lovers all love the young people for the future of the church and for the Lord's work
It is hard to say that those whom we feel are good now will be good in the future, and those whom we feel are bad today will be bad tomorrow
Regardless of whether the young people are good or bad we need to treat everyone the same and we need to like them and be concerned for them
If you cannot talk to them about the Lord Jesus because He is gone after you play ball, then your spirituality is false
The Lord asked the two disciples, saying, 'What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking'?
One of them replied, 'Do You alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days'?
Helping the young brothers and sisters depends not on your ability to give them messages but on your regular, frequent contacts with them
When you contact the young brothers and sisters, do not begin by asking, 'How many chapters of the Bible have you read today?
Such questions should not be brought up until you have had many contacts with them, maybe even after eight or ten times
Because young people have many practical problems, you need to sense their feelings beginning with these problems
We cannot say that to be fallen is right, but please remember that all those who truly know God's salvation were once fallen people
If a person has been preserved since his birth and has never lived in a fallen way, he cannot have a deep experience of God's salvation
Once he stayed in a hotel, but because he was not able to pay the fee, he was even sent to prison by the owner of the hotel
Today you may consider a certain young man very bad, but one day he may become very good, contrary to your view
In the same way, today you may think that a certain young man is very good, but some day he may become very bad
All those who have some experience in the young people's work will say, 'We don't trust in the young people's condition
Sometimes it is hard for those who are consistently good to have spiritual perception, and often their growth is slow
All those who have a desire to do the young people's work need to learn how to match and adapt to the young people
We who do the young people's work need to deal with our character to such an extent that we are just like glue
It seems very hard to do the young people's work because the young people are too busy to care about pursuing the Lord
We should work not only to the extent of gaining him but also to gain some people through him in that foreign country
Instead of regarding the prevailing trend of going abroad as a hindrance, we should consider it an outlet for our work
We need to correspond with the brothers and sisters who are studying abroad to continue communication with them
If we are doing a real work, then even if a young person flies to the sky, we will follow him there to adapt to him
If you really know the students' situation, you will know that with the young people, being busy is not a problem
When you gather them together, usually all you can do is give them a message and at most a little work of revival
You may be able to contact only one person in an hour, and sometimes you may not be able to contact even one person after half a day
Seemingly, this way is less effective than holding big meetings where you can speak to hundreds of people at once
You can see that even if there are no big meetings, many can still get saved and many can still be raised up to love the Lord
In the same way among so many young brothers and sisters you need to feel and see which ones once they are gained will have impact on others
If you hold big meetings from the outset, there will be only a twenty percent effect, and the other eighty percent will amount to zero
May the Lord be gracious to us that in His work and in the church we will treasure the souls of the young people
