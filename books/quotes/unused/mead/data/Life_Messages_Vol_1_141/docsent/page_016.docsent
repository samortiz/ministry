   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EFFECTS OF THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But after such an experience and such resolve, I still did not express much Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mostly I was still expressing myself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because I was born into this way, I was raised and educated to express myself, and I had been practicing this all my life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In actuality, however, it was not so much that I had grasped the vision; rather, something from heaven had grasped me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It controlled and directed me, again and again reminding me when I was living by my self.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I would be about to do something when the vision would come and I would see, "That is you again!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is your self!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I would stop in the middle of what I was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you see this vision, it will rescue you from your struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God does not want husbands by themselves to love their wives nor sisters to submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God wants you neither to love nor to hate, but to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not a matter of religion or ethics, but of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul said Gal 2:20 that he had been crucified with Christ, that it was no longer he but Christ living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I hate, I hate by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I love, I love by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To see this will save you from arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I was a young Christian, I loved the Lord and the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I would fight whatever I thought was wrong doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was sprinkled when I was young, and one day I realized that was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From then on I fought for immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But one day I said, "Why am I fighting for immersion?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Neither sprinkling nor immersion is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He just wants Himself in me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the churches these days there is discussion about whether to meet in homes or in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some even say they like to go to the beach to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must drop all the talk about ways to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No way is wrong; no way is right.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As long as we have Christ, every way is right.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without Him, every way is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us forget all the arguments and come back to the center lane, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>ABIDING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in Me" John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The real Christian life is described in this one verse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not to work for Christ, but to abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord says, "Abide in Me and I in you," He means that He can only abide in us as we abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not do our part by abiding in Him, He cannot do His part by abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are quarreling with someone and saying hateful words, can the Lord abide in you?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No. For Him to abide in you, you first of all have to abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord does not say we have to get into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He says, "Abide in Me."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that we the branches are in Christ already.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To abide means to remain; some versions render it this way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Just stay where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If my arm does not abide in my body, it is detached from all life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has put us in Christ 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This happened the day we believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE HINDRANCE TO ABIDING</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How can we abide in Christ constantly?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let us use the illustration of a radio.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Inside a radio are some complicated mechanisms which must all work properly in order for it to receive the waves from the air.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One simple thing can be wrong, and the radio will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So it is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Inside we are complicated by a conscience, a mind, a will, and emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If these are not all properly regulated, the heavenly electric wave cannot come in. If just one is out of order, this radio does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Should our conscience have an offense on it, for example, our abiding in Christ is frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As we know, man is composed of body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A large part of our spirit is the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we add to the conscience the three parts of the soul the mind, emotion, and will we have the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The other two parts of the spirit, intuition and fellowship, are not part of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only the conscience is part of both the spirit and the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>See diagram which follows.</S>
