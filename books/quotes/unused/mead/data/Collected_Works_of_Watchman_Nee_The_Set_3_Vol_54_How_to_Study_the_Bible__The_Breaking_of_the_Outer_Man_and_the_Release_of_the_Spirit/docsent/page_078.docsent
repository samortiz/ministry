   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people have the wrong concept that a man believes in the gospel because he has heard the right teachings, or because he is touched in his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But this is far from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who base their acceptance of the Lord on emotional impulses will not last, nor will those who are convinced by persuasion in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is nothing wrong with using the mind and the emotion, but these things are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A man is not saved through emotion and thought.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A sinner falls at the Lord's feet because the speaker's spirit has released light through his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As soon as our spirit gushes out, others are struck.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the reason we need a released spirit to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A coal miner was greatly used by the Lord in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wrote a book entitled Seen and Heard in which he described his experience with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were deeply touched by this book.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This brother was not an educated or gifted man; he was only an ordinary brother.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But his absolute consecration to the Lord became the basis for the Lord to use him greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you know what was so special about him?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was a broken man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His spirit could be released easily.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He started to preach at the age of twenty-three, when he first experienced salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In one meeting the word of a preacher kindled a burning desire within him to save souls.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He asked to be allowed to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After he stood up, he was unable to say anything, even though his heart was burning with fire for lost souls.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His tears came down like a torrent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the end he could only utter one or two sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's Spirit filled the meeting, and everyone was convicted of his own sin and waywardness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here was a man who, in spite of his young age, was broken in the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He did not have much to say, yet his spirit was released and men were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He led many people to salvation during his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we read his biography, we sense that he was a man with a released spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way to preach the gospel is to release the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the hardness of the outer man is removed and the outer man is broken, the spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the very sight of an unsaved person compels us to do something to save him, it means that our spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the basic issue.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The preaching of the gospel has everything to do with the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the outer man is broken, our spirit will be released and will touch others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is our spirit that reaches others' spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is God's Spirit that touches the darkened spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When this happens, a man is saved, and no reason can account for this change.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, when the outer man chokes the spirit, God does not have a way through us and the gospel will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We always have to pay attention to the matter of the breaking of the outer man because all of our problems lie in the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we, the person, are not dealt with, it is useless for us to memorize more teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The only thing that will bring salvation to men is for our spirit to touch others' spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If our spirit touches others' spirits, they will fall on their face before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If our spirit is discharged in a strong way, they will have no choice but to prostrate themselves before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During these years God has been taking the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God does not want to see a saved person wait for many years before he deals with his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He does not want to see him wait for many years before he consecrates himself to the Lord or answers the Lord's call to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord is taking the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The gospel has to be recovered, and the fruit of the gospel has to be recovered as well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As soon as a man is saved, he should be delivered from sin and should consecrate himself absolutely to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As soon as he is saved, he should break the power of mammon in him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He should be like the ones who were saved by the Lord in the Gospels and in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the gospel is indeed to be recovered, the preachers of the gospel must allow the Lord to cut a free way through them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We believe that as the Lord takes the way of recovery, the gospel of grace will become one with the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Gospels we see no separation between the gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Later, it seems as though those who heard the gospel of grace did not have a chance to hear the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The gospel of grace seems to have been separated from the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the time will come when the gospel of grace will become one with the gospel of the kingdom once again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who receive the Lord will also give up everything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those who accept Him will also consecrate everything to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Men will no longer be saved in a poor way but in a strong and thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to humble ourselves before the Lord and say, "The gospel needs to be recovered, and the ones who preach the gospel also need to be recovered."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In order for the gospel to reach men, we have to allow God to work through us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A greater power is needed for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even so, a greater price needs to be paid.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we expect both the gospel as well as the ones who preach the gospel to be recovered, we have to give everything to the Lord and say, "Lord, I give my all to You.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I pray that You will find a way through me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I pray that the church will also find a way through me.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I do not want to hinder You or the church."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord Jesus was never a limitation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He never limited God in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Throughout the past two thousand years God has been working in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The goal is for the church to eventually not be a limitation to Him either.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Just as Christ was God's manifestation rather than His limitation, the church should be His manifestation rather than His limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God has been teaching, buffeting, stripping, and smiting His children continually.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is how He deals with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He will continue this work in the church until the church no longer is a limitation to Him but a manifestation of Him instead.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today we can only bow down our heads and say, "Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We are ashamed that we have delayed Your work.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have frustrated Your life, Your gospel, and Your power."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Each one of us has to say to the Lord, "I give my all to You.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I pray that You will have a way through me."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we want to see an absolute recovery of the gospel, we have to have an absolute consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is foolish to only lament the fact that our gospel is not as powerful as that of the early church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have to acknowledge that our consecration is not as absolute as the consecration of the early church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In order to recover the gospel, we have to recover the consecration; both have to be absolute and thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>May the Lord find a way through us.</S>
