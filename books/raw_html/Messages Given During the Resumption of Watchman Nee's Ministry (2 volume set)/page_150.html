<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Accepting and Exercise of Authority</H2><P>Some people like to assume headship apart from Christ. These are busybodies. You cannot entrust authority to them. Authority is received from the Head. Only after a person has received such authority can he execute it. Only those who are willing to accept authority can execute authority. The Chief of Police has received a commission. That is why he can execute his authority. No one is born a Chief of Police; he has to receive the responsibility first, before he can execute his authority. We must see the Head first, and we must first realize that He is behind us, before we can have the assurance to speak. I have no interest in touching others' affairs. All those who are interested in touching others' affairs, who like to be the head, and who like to express opinions, have to be stopped. If we do not do this, all those who like to make a display of themselves will become the authorities. In the Body, it is wrong both to be free and to be autocratic. Those who are spiritual and who are weighty before the Lord should rise up to speak. It is not because we love to speak that we speak. When we speak, we have to speak in the presence of God. Those who by their natural disposition do not like to be involved with others and who do not like to speak should be strong to speak. Those who by their natural disposition like to touch others' affairs should be restricted. What we want is the coordination of the Body, and not the coordination of the flesh.</P><P>The feet are not comely. The head is comely. This is why more people wear shoes than hats. The stronger a member is in the Body, the more it can supply others. The weaker a member is, the more it should receive supply from others (1 Cor. 12:22-24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REPORT OF THE WORK</H2><P>We need to give a report concerning the work.</P><P>For many days, we have been waiting before the Lord, inquiring of Him as to the way to go on in the work. We think that first we have to concentrate our efforts together to maintain the testimonies along the coastal provinces. The apostles remained first in Jerusalem. Later Philip went to other places to preach the gospel (Acts 8:1, 5). As far as our number is concerned, what we have is not enough to meet the need of the places along the coast. The political situation in northern China is very unstable. Hence, we should concentrate on Foochow and Shanghai, and we should have a start in these two places at the same time. At present, we have over thirty co-workers. The number is not large. We should not have other co-workers wait in their localities for too long. To maintain a local testimony, there is not too much difference between the effort of ten people and that of twenty people. If the Lord is merciful to us, Hong Kong can be linked up with Canton, in the same way that Nanking and Hangchow are linked up with Shanghai. These are only suggestions. If you think that this is right before the Lord, we can go ahead and try these things out.</P><P>Brother Chang Wu-chen, Chang Chi-jie, the two brother Chows, Hsu Chung-jie, Weigh Kwang-hsi, Sister Liu Hwei-fen, Kwei Ru-yu, Wang Hsu-ching, Juo Fu-ru, Miao Yun-chun, Mrs. Lin Pu-ji, Mrs. Lee Yin-shin, and Mrs. Weigh Kwang-hsi should go to Fukien to join the first term of training.</P><P>Those co-workers who should remain in Shanghai: Brother David Hsu, Chang Yu-chi, Chu Chen, Du Chung-chen, Ren Chung-shiang, Witness Lee, Jiang Shui-wu, Sister Ruth Lee, Chang Shi-nien, Pearl Wang, Chow Ching-mei.</P><P>For Nanking, there are Brother Chang Yu-lan, Chi Yun-tung, and others.</P><P>Brother Hsia Hsi-ling will return to Tientsin. He should drop his job sooner or later.</P><P>Brother Lan Chi-yi will return temporarily to Hankow. Later, if he can find others to substitute for him, he can also come to Foochow.</P>
