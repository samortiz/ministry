</ol>
<p>In this book we will fellowship concerning two basic, crucial, vital, and living matters in the New Testament: the apostles&rsquo; teaching and the New Testament leadership. These two matters in the New Testament are very crucial. We need the apostles&rsquo; teaching, and we also need the proper leadership. To annul these two matters is to annul the New Testament. The riches of Christ are conveyed in the teaching of the apostles and in the New Testament leadership.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENTIRE TEACHING OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching is the entire teaching of the New Testament from the first to the last page. It is not merely a part of the New Testament. All twenty-seven books of the New Testament are the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Speaking in the Son<br />
to His New Testament People</h2>
<p>The entire teaching of the New Testament, which is the apostles&rsquo; teaching, is God&rsquo;s speaking, God&rsquo;s oracle, in the Son to His New Testament people (Heb. 1:1-2). Hebrews 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo; In the New Testament, God only speaks in one Person, the Son. It may seem that God spoke in the Son, Jesus Christ, only in the four Gospels, and that in Acts and the Epistles God spoke in Peter, Paul, James, John, and Jude. However, we should not consider that Peter, Paul, James, John, and Jude are separate from the Son of God. They are members of the corporate Son of God (1 Cor. 12:27). In Acts 9 when Saul of Tarsus was persecuting the followers of Jesus, he did not realize that he was persecuting Jesus. He thought he was only persecuting Stephen and the other believers. On his way to Damascus, however, Jesus appeared to him. Acts 9:4-5 says, &ldquo;And he fell on the ground and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? And he said, Who are You, Lord? And He said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.&rdquo; This was not simply the individual Jesus, who is Christ. This was the enlarged, corporate Christ, and Stephen, Peter, and all His followers were His members. The entire New Testament is the speaking of God in the Son, regardless through whom He spoke, because the speakers in the New Testament spoke as the members of Christ.</p>
<p>Even today God is still speaking in the enlarged, corporate Son. When we speak as the members of Christ, our speaking becomes His speaking. Every time before I speak in a meeting, I like to offer a prayer: &ldquo;Lord, be one spirit with me that I may be one spirit with You. Lord, speak in my speaking, making my speaking Yours.&rdquo; This kind of prayer makes a difference in the speaking. When I speak in this way, I do not merely speak in myself; I speak in the Son.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son to His New Testament people was firstly the direct teaching of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels. These direct teachings of the Lord Jesus are the healthy words (1 Tim. 6:3a). They were spoken to His first group of disciples and were to be taught to all His disciples (Matt. 28:19-20). The Lord charged His first group of disciples in Matthew 28:19-20 to disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God, &ldquo;teaching them to observe all things, whatever I commanded you&rdquo; (v. 20a).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son is also the teaching of the Spirit of truth (John 16:12-15). In John 16:12-13 the Lord told the disciples, &ldquo;I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.&rdquo; What the Spirit spoke through the New Testament writers was the speaking of Jesus.</p>
<p>The teaching of the Spirit of truth is the teaching according to godliness (1 Tim. 6:3b). Godliness is not merely piety, but the living that is the expression of God, the manifestation of God in the flesh. The teaching and speaking of the Spirit according to godliness is through the apostles. This teaching was firstly through Peter and Paul in Acts, including their words, their works, and their way of working. The words, works, and way of working of Peter and Paul in Acts were the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking. This teaching was next through Paul in his fourteen Epistles, from Romans to Hebrews. Without the fourteen Epistles of Paul, there would be a gap in the New Testament that could not be bridged. The teaching of the Spirit of truth was next through James in his Epistle, Peter in his two Epistles, Jude in his Epistle, and John in his three Epistles and Revelation.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the books of the Bible was under the inspiration and sovereign control of the Spirit. After the Acts are the fourteen Epistles of Paul, followed by the short books of James, Peter, John, and Jude, and the book of Revelation. Paul&rsquo;s speaking is lengthy, but the speaking of James, Peter, Jude, and John in their Epistles is shorter. The difference in the lengths of the Epistles may be compared to our functioning in the meetings. We all should speak, but sometimes our speaking should be short. The church needs the short speakings. However, some have to speak for a longer time. The longer speakings of Paul and John unveil to us the mystery of our mystical union with Christ. These two writers speak many times of our being in Christ and His being in us. The Gospel of John often uses the phrases &ldquo;in Him&rdquo; and &ldquo;in Me&rdquo; (7:5, 31, 38, 39, 48). John 14:20 says, &ldquo;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; Paul also says many times that we are in Christ and Christ is in us (Rom. 8:1; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 2:20).</p><h2 class="head2">Completed through Paul and John</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s speaking in the teaching of the New Testament was completed through Paul and John (Col. 1:25-26; Rev. 22:18-19). The word of God as the revealed mystery was completed by Paul&rsquo;s writings. Colossians 1:25-26 says, &ldquo;Of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now has been manifested to His saints.&rdquo; The entire New Testament was completed by John&rsquo;s writings. Revelation 22:18-19 says, &ldquo;I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.&rdquo; No other book in the Bible says this. Only the last book of John declares that his writing is the completion of the entire New Testament revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE, DIVINE REVELATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>The entire teaching of the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles, is the unique, divine revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This revelation is concerning the mystery of God&mdash;Christ (Col. 2:2-3, 9), the mystery of Christ&mdash;the church (Eph. 3:3-11), and the great mystery&mdash;Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32). These three items comprise God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Items such as baptism by water, speaking in tongues, head covering, and foot-washing are not the focus of the economy of God. These items are in the Bible, but they are not the crucial parts of God&rsquo;s economy. The crucial constituents of God&rsquo;s economy are Christ as the mystery of God, the church as the mystery of Christ, and Christ and the church as the great mystery in the universe. The entire New Testament is a unique, divine revelation concerning mainly three persons or items: the Triune God, the all-inclusive Christ, and the church as the organism of the Triune God, the organic Body of Christ. These three are crucial, vital, and basic. Whether or not our speaking is according to the New Testament economy can be measured by its relationship to these three items.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENTS OF THE FULL GOSPEL OF GOD</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching, the entire teaching of the New Testament, the unique, divine revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, is the contents of the full gospel of God (Rom. 1:1-4). The gospel of God mentioned in Romans 1:1-4 is the full gospel of God, comprising not merely a part of the New Testament, but the entire New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching is the constitution of the Christian faith (Jude 3; 1 Tim. 1:19; 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:7). The Christian faith refers to our belief. Our belief, our faith, our creed, is a great matter. It is the entire New Testament. Our creed is a long one. It starts from the beginning of Matthew and continues to the end of Revelation. This creed is our belief, and our belief is the Christian faith.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANY TEACHING DIFFERENT FROM THIS UNIQUE REVELATION NOT ALLOWED BY THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>Any teaching different from this unique revelation is not allowed by the apostles (1 Tim. 1:3-4; 2 John 9-11). In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul told Timothy, &ldquo;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently.&rdquo; The different teachings included things from the Old Testament, yet they were different from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, God&rsquo;s New Testament dispensation. Such teachings were not allowed by the apostles. The apostles were strict in this matter. Second John 9-11 says, &ldquo;Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God....If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice! For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works.&rdquo; John warned us not to say anything to such a one, but to stay away from him. Some may feel that they are not able to be so strict. However, even one who claims to be a Christian but teaches differently from the apostles&rsquo; teaching, the New Testament teaching, the unique revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, is an evildoer, and we should not greet him. To teach differently is not a small matter. It is a direct work of Satan.</p><h2 class="head1">ANY OTHER BELIEF BESIDES THIS UNIQUE FAITH<br />
NOT ALLOWED BY THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>Any other belief besides this unique faith is not allowed by the apostles (Gal. 1:7-9). Galatians 1:8 says, &ldquo;But if even we or an angel out of heaven should preach to you a gospel besides that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.&rdquo; Paul taught us in Romans 12:14 to bless and not curse those who persecute us, but here Paul tells us that some people are to be accursed. The apostles were very strict in their teaching, that is, in the New Testament teaching, the contents of the full gospel of God and the constitution of our Christian faith.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL TEACHINGS DIFFERENT FROM<br />
THE UNIQUE REVELATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY<br />
BEING CONSIDERED BY THE APOSTLES<br />
AS WINDS OF TEACHING</h2>
<p>All teachings different from the unique revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy were considered by the apostles as winds of teaching (Eph. 4:14). In this regard the apostles were very strict. These winds of teaching are in the sleight of men&rsquo;s cheating. The Greek word for &ldquo;sleight&rdquo; refers to the playing of dice in gambling. The different teachings are like the playing of dice for the purpose of cheating us. This sleight is in the craftiness of men&rsquo;s deception. The differing teachings are a deception, cheating, and falsehood. They are with a view to inducing men into the satanic system of error. Behind men&rsquo;s sleight, men&rsquo;s craftiness, in teaching things different from the New Testament economy, is the satanic system. Satan has a system, and if it were possible, he would induce all Christians into it. The goal, the aim, the purpose, of his system is to carry the saints away from the central lane of the divine revelation with the intention of frustrating and even tearing down the building up of the Body of Christ. Some winds of teaching do not appear to be evil. However, the factor of evil is there to induce the saints into the satanic system of error, to frustrate them from building up the Body of Christ, and even to tear down the building up of the Body of Christ. The winds of teaching also cause the babes to be tossed by waves and thereby to suffer uneasiness in the church life.</p>
<p>There is a good test for discerning the winds of teaching. Certain teachings cause us to be cold and even deadened. After listening to such a teaching, we are deadened within. A certain teaching may also take away our morale for following the Lord, caring for His interest, and loving the church and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If any teaching, regardless of how good or scriptural it may appear to be, has any of these negative effects, this is strong evidence that this teaching is a wind that will blow us away from the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Many of us have suffered the blowing of the winds of teaching. We may have had the morale to follow the Lord, to love the church, to love the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and to love the Bible, but after listening to such a teaching for half an hour, the morale was gone, and we were deadened.</p>
<p>If the teachings differing from the unique revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy did not appear to be good, no one would accept them. Teachings may be compared to seafood, but according to the typology in Leviticus, certain foods from the sea are unclean. Leviticus 11:10-11 tells us that aquatic animals without fins and scales are unclean. The guarantee of cleanness is in the fins and scales. The &ldquo;fins&rdquo; and &ldquo;scales&rdquo; of the New Testament teaching are the Triune God, the all-inclusive Christ, and the church as the organic Body of Christ. By these we can measure others&rsquo; teachings. If a teaching is not related to these three items, it does not have &ldquo;fins&rdquo; and &ldquo;scales.&rdquo; Regardless of how good such a teaching may appear to be, for safety&rsquo;s sake we should not take it.</p>
<p>The New Testament only contains twenty-seven books, but within it there are many facts. One might emphasize a particular point, such as speaking in tongues in 1 Corinthians 14, claiming that it too is a part of the New Testament teaching. Although such a teaching may seem scriptural, it may not have &ldquo;fins&rdquo; and &ldquo;scales.&rdquo; We must learn to have discernment in our &ldquo;eating,&rdquo; in our receiving of teachings. We must not receive any teaching so easily. Those who bring the winds of teaching often appear to be very loving, apparently showing care and concern for us. However, we should not quickly receive their word. We must consider whether their teaching has &ldquo;fins&rdquo; and &ldquo;scales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching, the New Testament teaching, is very crucial. Whenever we hear something differing from the apostles&rsquo; teaching, we should not be bothered or affected. We should simply come back to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. However, if we are not able to properly discern a teaching, we should fellowship with certain saints to receive some help. In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, there is only one kind of teaching revealed and recognized by God&mdash;the teaching of the apostles. We need to continue steadfastly in this teaching (Acts 2:42).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEW TESTAMENT LEADERSHIP</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:36; 5:31; Rev. 1:5; Eph. 1:22; Col. 1:18; 1 Cor. 11:3; Heb. 13:24; Rom. 12:8; 1 Tim. 5:17; 3:2; 1 Pet. 5:2-3; 1 Thes. 5:12; Heb. 13:17; Gal. 2:7; Rom. 11:13; 1 Cor. 16:12; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 2 John 9-11; 2 Cor. 13:10; 1 Cor. 4:17b-21; 7:17b; 16:1; 11:2; 2 Thes. 3:6, 9, 12, 14; 1 Cor. 1:10; 5:11-13; 11:34b; 2 Cor. 10:6; Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5; 1 Tim. 5:19-20; Exo. 28:29-30; Num. 27:15-23; 1 Sam. 3:1, 19-21; Acts 15:6, 23, 28; 2:42; 13:1</h1>

		</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the New Testament leadership. The proper leadership is a great matter. In any human institution there is the need of a proper leadership. If a country has an excellent president, that country will be an excellent country. If, on the other hand, the leadership is poor, the people of that country will suffer. Even in a family, having the proper leadership helps everyone in the family. Without the proper leadership, there is confusion and disorder. God is not a God of confusion, but of peace and order (1 Cor. 14:33, 40). Any situation of confusion is not of God; everything of God is always in order. The universe is so great, but all the billions of items in it are in a proper order. Because everything is in order in God&rsquo;s creation, the earth is in a peaceful, restful situation. A small change in this order, however, would make the earth unable to support us.</p>
<p>Because man was created by God, everything related to his physical body is in order. If even the smallest disorder occurs in our body, we become sick and suffer. In the same way that our physical body is in such a proper order, there is also an order in the church, which is the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27; Eph. 1:22-23). Some have said that since the church is the church of the saints, the saints in the church are equal in every way, with no leadership or delegated authority among them. This is a wind of teaching (Eph. 4:14) which disrupts the church and brings disorder to it. The Bible does say that the church is the church of God (1 Cor. 1:2; 10:32), the church of Christ (Rom. 16:16), and the church of the saints (1 Cor. 14:33). There is no verse in the Bible that tells us that the church is the church of the apostles. The apostles never proclaimed themselves to be the owners of the church. Rather, they preached Christ Jesus as Lord and themselves as slaves to the churches (2 Cor. 4:5). However, this does not mean that every member in the Body is a head. For all the members to be the same with no leadership among them is not according to God&rsquo;s ordination.</p>
<p>When God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament became a collective entity, there was a proper situation of order among them. Likewise, in the entire New Testament, we can see that God is altogether against any kind of confusion. We have to see the truth of the New Testament leadership according to the pure Word of God. The Bible is our &ldquo;constitution.&rdquo; In a democratic country such as America, the highest authority is not the president or the Congress. It is the constitution. To solve any matter, we must come back to our &ldquo;constitution,&rdquo; the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Concerning the New Testament leadership, the Bible firstly speaks of the headship of Christ. The unique Head of the entire universe is the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Having Been Made Lord and Christ by God</h2>
<p>Christ was made Lord and Christ by God (Acts 2:36). As God, the Lord was the Lord all the time (Luke 1:43; John 11:21; 20:28). However, in His incarnation He became a man; the Creator became a creature. As man, He was made the Lord in His ascension after He brought His humanity into God in His resurrection. Moreover, as God&rsquo;s sent and anointed One, He was Christ from the time He was born (Luke 2:11; Matt. 1:16; John 1:41; Matt. 16:16), but as such a One, He was officially made the very Christ of God in His ascension.</p>
<p>God made the man Jesus the Lord to head up and own all things. None of the founders of any religion, such as Mohammed or Buddha, were called the Lord. Only Christ Jesus is the Lord. As Christians, we have the deep realization that Jesus is our Lord. Especially during times of trouble or even at times when something good happens to us, the first thing we often say is, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; How good it is to have Jesus as Lord! Jesus was made the Lord, as the Lord of all (Acts 10:36), to possess all. If one does not have Jesus, he does not have an owner. Jesus was also made the Christ in His resurrection and ascension to carry out God&rsquo;s commission, His plan and eternal economy. The Lord is the owner, and Christ is the doer. He is the One who owns all things, and He is the One who fulfills God&rsquo;s commission.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Having Been Exalted<br />
as the Leader over All the Rulers</h2>
<p>Christ was exalted as the Leader over all the rulers (Acts 5:31). Acts 5:31 says, &ldquo;This One God has exalted to His right hand as a Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; The way He saves us is by being the Leader. Because He controls all things, He has the power, authority, ability, and capacity to save us. Under His leadership we have been saved. He has the authority and power, if He should so desire, to remove a king in order to save even one of His people. The account of Pharaoh and the people of Israel in Exodus is a demonstration of the Lord&rsquo;s authority and power to save. In Egypt, Pharaoh kept all the children of Israel in slavery, and God sent Moses to tell Pharaoh to let His people go (Exo. 5:1). When Pharaoh refused, the Lord brought the plagues upon him, and he asked Moses to entreat the Lord for him (Exo. 8:8, 28; 9:27-28; 10:16-17). Eventually, Pharaoh was subdued, and he released the people of Israel (Exo. 11:1; 12:31). The Savior saved His people through His power and authority.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s authority and power as the Leader over all the rulers can be seen in His control over the world situation. My intention since the early 1940s was to evangelize the northwest portions of China and Mongolia. I never thought that I would eventually come to America. However, due to the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty in the world situation, I am here today. The One who brought me to this country was the Leader over all the rulers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Having Been Made<br />
the Ruler of the Kings of the Earth</h2>
<p>Christ has been made the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5). On the earth there have been many kings, queens, and presidents, but the Ruler of all these is Christ. God made Christ the Ruler and exalted Him as the Leader.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Having Been Appointed to Be the Head over All Things to the Church<br />
and Being the Head of the Church</h2>
<p>Moreover, God has appointed Christ to be the Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22). Whatever Christ is, is to the church. Christ is the Head of the church (Col. 1:18). Whatever the Head is, is transmitted to the church by the circulation of life in the Body.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Head of Every Man<br />
under the Headship of God</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Head of every man under the headship of God (1 Cor. 11:3). Christ is the Head of the church corporately and the Head of every man individually. Still He Himself is under the headship of God. What a marvelous order there is in the universe. God is over Christ, and Christ is over all things. As the Head of all things, He is the Head of the church and the Head of every man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LEADERSHIP IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>The New Testament leadership comprises the elders in the church and those who take the lead in the ministry. It is not right to say that there is no leadership in the church. Even in the proper family life there is a leadership. When the parents are away from home, the oldest brother or sister is left as a leader for the other children. If both the parents and the older children are away, a baby-sitter is left with the remaining children to be a leader for them. In every situation there is the need for a leader. In the church life the elders take the lead diligently (Heb. 13:24; Rom. 12:8). All the elders are the leading ones in the church. Without leaders we could not have an orderly church life with so many arrangements. Rather, we would have confusion in the church life.</p>
<p>The leadership in the church life is carried out by the elders&rsquo; laboring in teaching the saints (1 Tim. 5:17; 3:2) and their shepherding the church as the flock of God, overseeing it according to God, and becoming patterns of the flock, not lording it over the flock (1 Pet. 5:2-3). The leaders in the church must take the lead in all things. They must be the leading sheep, the head sheep, in the flock. When the sheep at the head of the flock move, the rest of the sheep follow. However, when the sheep in the front do nothing, the whole flock stops. If the restrooms in the meeting hall need to be cleaned, the elders should take the lead to clean them. The elders should also be the first ones to go out to visit people for the gospel by knocking on their doors. If the elders go out to preach the gospel, many in the church will follow them. If, on the other hand, the elders do not take the lead to go out, but simply exhort the other saints to do it, not many of the saints will go. The way to be an elder is not to command others but to take the lead. If the elders labor in teaching and if they shepherd, oversee, and are patterns of the flock, all the saints will respect and obey them as leaders.</p>
<p>The elders should be regarded, obeyed, and honored by the saints (1 Thes. 5:12-13; Heb. 13:17; 1 Tim. 5:17). The honor given to the elders may include material supply. Some elders do not take a job for their living because they are too busy in the matters of the church. They do not have an income; they live by faith. The saints should honor them by giving them some material supply. This is the proper order with a proper, beautiful situation in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LEADERSHIP IN THE MINISTRY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Peter Taking the Lead in the<br />
New Testament Ministry among the Jews<br />
and Paul Taking the Lead in the<br />
New Testament Ministry among the Gentiles</h2>
<p>The New Testament leadership also comprises the leadership in the ministry. Peter took the lead in the New Testament ministry among the Jews (Gal. 2:7b). We can see Peter&rsquo;s lead in the ministry in the first twelve chapters of Acts. Paul took the lead in the New Testament ministry among the Gentiles (Gal. 2:7a) in the last sixteen chapters of Acts.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Leadership in the New Testament Ministry Being in the New Testament Teaching<br />
More Than in the Leading Ones<br />
of the New Testament Ministry</h2>
<p>The leadership in the New Testament ministry is in the New Testament teaching more than in the leading ones of the New Testament ministry. In America the leadership of the country is in the constitution more than in the presidency. The critical factor in the government is the constitution. Likewise, the New Testament leadership was not in Peter or in Paul as much as it was in their teaching. If Peter or Paul would have turned from their teaching, the saints would not have followed them. The churches followed the apostles&rsquo; teaching, and they followed the apostles because the apostles had the New Testament teaching. The apostles kept their teaching, they were in their teaching, and they were one with it.</p>
<p>In 1934 there was a turmoil in the church in Shanghai, mainly directed against Brother Nee. At that time I assured him that I completely followed him, not because of who he was, but because of the teaching and revelation he brought into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Brother Nee and I had not known each other formerly; we had no personal affection. He took the lead, and I followed him because he had the revelation in his teaching and he kept the revelation. I also told him that if one day he would deviate from the revelation he had passed on to us, I would still follow the revelation, but I would no longer follow him.</p>
<p>Today, because of the present rebellion in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, some saints are trying to vindicate me. However, I do not care to be vindicated. Rather, it is the teaching in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery which should be vindicated. The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery do not follow a man, but they follow the teaching of this ministry. However, following the teaching and not the minister does not mean that we should reject the minister. Some have twisted my word concerning not following a man but following his teaching and claim to be following my teaching while rejecting me. Even the students in a school cannot receive teaching while rejecting the teacher. What the ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has brought to the churches is according to the New Testament teaching of the apostles. For this reason I am at peace. I do not care about the turmoils in the church. The turmoils cannot overthrow the New Testament ministry.</p>
<p>Some have wrongly taught that the local churches are autonomous, that once an apostle establishes a local church and appoints the elders, he is through with that church and should stay away. This is not according to the Bible. The Apostle Paul established churches, and he appointed the elders in the churches (Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5). After this, however, he did not stay away from the churches. He visited the church in Ephesus after it was established and once stayed there for three years. Later, while he was returning to Jerusalem, he could not forget the church in Ephesus. Acts 20 tells us that from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church (v. 17). They came to him, and he spoke a long word, warning, instructing, and even charging them. Acts 20:31 says, &ldquo;Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears.&rdquo; Verse 20 says, &ldquo;How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house.&rdquo; No doubt, he taught the saints in Ephesus concerning God&rsquo;s economy and concerning their daily life, declaring to them anything that was profitable. He told the elders in verses 29 and 30, &ldquo;I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.&rdquo; This shows how concerned Paul was for the future of the church in Ephesus. Paul also wrote an Epistle to the church there. This illustrates that the apostles never stayed away from the churches which they had established.</p>
<p>The leading ones in the ministry were not strict in directing the move of their co-workers. First Corinthians 16:12 says, &ldquo;Now concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him much that he would come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come whenever he has opportunity.&rdquo; The leading ones were strict, however, in the teaching of the New Testament (1 Tim. 1:3-4; 2 John 9-11). First Timothy 1:3 says, &ldquo;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently.&rdquo; Second John 9-10 says, &ldquo;Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God....If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!&rdquo; The apostles were not strict in directing a co-worker such as Apollos to go to a certain place. However, they were very strict concerning the New Testament teaching. This proves that the real leadership in the ministry is in the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p><h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Delegated Authority in the Leading Ones</h2>
<p>The New Testament shows us God&rsquo;s delegated authority in the leading ones in the ministry. In a family there is delegated authority, and in human government there is also delegated authority. Without delegated authorities, the whole earth would be in anarchy and disorder and would be unsuitable for living in. Today a wind of teaching is blowing in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, saying that there is no delegated authority in the church. According to this teaching, Brother Nee was wrong in his book <em>Authority and Submission.</em> If Brother Nee was wrong, the Bible is also wrong because the Bible strongly reveals God&rsquo;s delegated authority in the church life and in the ministry.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s delegated authority in the leading ones in the ministry was for building up and not for overthrowing (2 Cor. 13:10). Paul had authority, not to destroy or overthrow, but for building up. God&rsquo;s delegated authority was in the teaching of the leading ones (1 Cor. 4:17b-21; 7:17b; 16:1; 11:2; 2 Thes. 3:6, 9, 12, 14). Paul exercised his authority in his teaching. He taught the same thing everywhere in every church (1 Cor. 4:17b), and the churches followed his speaking. This was the demonstration of Paul&rsquo;s delegated authority. Authority always follows the proper speaking. A teacher&rsquo;s speaking in a school is with authority. When the teacher speaks, all the students are under his authority.</p>
<p>The leadership in the ministry was in the leading ones&rsquo; dealing with the problems and affairs of the churches (1 Cor. 1:10; 5:11-13; 11:34b). Paul was strong in dealing with the church in Corinth. In 1 Corinthians 4:21 he said, &ldquo;What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?&rdquo; In 11:34 he said, &ldquo;And the remaining matters I will set in order when I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leadership in the ministry was also in the leading ones&rsquo; avenging of the saints&rsquo; disobedience (2 Cor. 10:6). In 2 Corinthians 10:6 Paul said, &ldquo;And being ready to avenge all disobedience, whenever your obedience is fulfilled.&rdquo; Paul intended to avenge all disobedience when the Corinthians themselves had learned obedience.</p>
<p>The leadership in the ministry was also in the appointing of and dealing with the elders (Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5; 1 Tim. 5:19-20). First Timothy 5:19-20 shows that not only did the apostles have the authority to appoint the elders, but they also had the authority to judge them, including the authority to remove them. This shows us that the apostles were the delegated authority of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S GOVERNMENT<br />
IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>Even among the children of Israel in the Old Testament, God had a government for His administration to fulfill His purpose. God also has His government in the administration of the churches in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Autocracy nor Democracy, but Theocracy</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s government is neither autocracy nor democracy, but theocracy. Autocracy is dictatorship, and democracy is government by the people. Humanly speaking, democracy is wonderful, but to bring democracy into the church brings in the opinions of the people. This is like the church in Laodicea in Revelation 3. The word <em>Laodicea</em> in Greek means &ldquo;the opinion of the people.&rdquo; In the United States government, congressmen and senators represent the states to express the people&rsquo;s opinion. God&rsquo;s government in the church is not like this. God&rsquo;s government in the church is theocratic.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Theocratic Government among<br />
the People of Israel in the Old Testament</h2>
<p>The theocratic government among the people of Israel in the Old Testament was through the priesthood with the Urim and the Thummim (Exo. 28:29-30; Num. 27:15-23). The priests in the priesthood were very close to God, even one with God. God could open Himself to them, and they could open themselves to God so that there could be a mutual understanding between them and God. They had the ability, the capacity, to receive God&rsquo;s revelation, God&rsquo;s speaking, God&rsquo;s oracle.</p>
<p>The high priest wore a breastplate with twelve precious stones bearing the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. Two items were added to the breastplate called Urim and Thummim. <em>Urim</em> means light, and <em>Thummim</em> means perfection. The Urim was something that enlightened the stones on the breastplate. The twelve names of Israel on the twelve stones only occupied eighteen of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Therefore, there was a shortage of four Hebrew letters on the breastplate. The Thummim was something added to the breastplate that bore these four additional letters to make the Hebrew alphabet complete on the breastplate. This is perfection.</p>
<p>When the high priest came into the presence of God, he received the speaking of God by means of the shining of the Urim on the twelve stones of the breastplate with the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, including the Thummim. The breastplate was like a typewriter to form words, phrases, and sentences. Thus, God spoke to the children of Israel through the high priest with the Urim and Thummim. (For more details regarding the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim, see Messages One Hundred Twenty-Three through One Hundred Twenty-Nine of the Life-study of Exodus, pp. 1381-1434.)</p>
<p>The theocratic government among the people of Israel in the Old Testament was also through the coordination of the prophets (1 Sam. 3:1, 19-21). The prophets were a strengthening to the priesthood when the priesthood was not strong. This is why there was the need of both priests and prophets.</p><h2 class="head2">The Theocratic Government<br />
in the Churches in the New Testament</h2>
<p>The theocratic government in the churches in the New Testament is through the Spirit who dwells in the spirits of the apostles and the elders, both of whom are the New Testament priests, with the revelation of the New Testament teaching (Acts 15:6, 23, 28; 2:42; 1 Thes. 5:12; 1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17). The Urim and Thummim on the breastplate of the high priest in the Old Testament typify the unveiling Spirit, the Holy Spirit, indwelling our receiving spirit, our regenerated spirit. These two spirits mingled together are today&rsquo;s Urim and Thummim. Whenever the apostles and the elders as the New Testament priests come to the Lord and wait on Him for His administration in the church, they will surely receive some light and some word from the Lord. By this way we have God&rsquo;s speaking in the administration of the church to carry out His theocratic government.</p>
<p>This theocratic government is also through the coordination of the New Testament prophets (Acts 13:1). In a local church there should always be some prophets to strengthen our inner feeling. This is the New Testament theocratic government for God&rsquo;s administration in the church to carry out His New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Now we need to consider the practical application of this fellowship in a local church. Whenever the elders of a local church come to the Lord, they come as priests. Because they bear the responsibility of the eldership, they want to know how to take the lead, how to teach, how to shepherd, how to oversee, and how to be patterns. Therefore, they have to pray together, to wait on the Lord. As they pray and fellowship, the indwelling Spirit will speak and enlighten them inwardly. In their regenerated spirit, they will receive something of the Lord. Then they will realize how the Lord wants them to take the lead, to shepherd, to oversee, and to be patterns. Because this may not be so adequate or strong, there are the prophets in the churches. The prophets&rsquo; speaking strengthens the elders&rsquo; understanding of the will of God. The functioning of the elders and the prophets in this way constitutes a kind of government for the administration of God in His church to fulfill His eternal purpose.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s theocratic government in the churches in the New Testament is according to the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God indwelling the leading ones. When the leading ones go to the Lord to seek His leading, they receive some inner understanding. When the prophets prophesy, what they say strengthens the feeling of the leading ones. The result of this divine coordination of the New Testament priests and prophets in the Body of Christ is the God-commanded blessing (Psa. 133:3). I hope that all of us can now have a clear view concerning the New Testament leadership, including the headship of Christ, the leadership in the church life, the leadership in the ministry, and God&rsquo;s government in the administration of the churches.</p></body></html>
