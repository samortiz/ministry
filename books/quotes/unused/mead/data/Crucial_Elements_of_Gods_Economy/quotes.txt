[1]  The Lord s Recovery Being the Recovery of Christ
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE WORD BEING THE EMBODIMENT OF GOD, CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, AND LIFE Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4; 14:6a; 10:10b; 6:63; 15:7a; 14:17, 20; 1 John 1:1; Rom 8:2
[3]  The main items mentioned in the Scripture reading above are God, Christ, the Spirit, and life.
[4]  Although we have received Christ and He is now in us as our life, in our experience the life within us will gradually disappear if we do not touch the Word, the Bible.
[5]  THREE WAYS TO COME TO THE WORD The Way of Being Nourished
[6]  Now that we have seen that we need to come to the Word daily, we need to go on to see the way to come to the Word.
[7]  If we use the words of the Bible for our prayer, we will touch God, Christ, the Spirit, and life.
[8]  The second way to come to the Bible is the way of reading.
[9]  AND OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 6:63; 1 Cor 1:18; Phil 2:16a; 1 John 2:27; John 7:39; Exo 30:23-25 THE BIBLE BEING THE EMBODIMENT OF CHRIST
[10]  The New Testament clearly reveals that God s economy is to dispense Christ into all His believers.
[11]  God s economy is a dispensing work to dispense Christ into our very being, making Christ our life and even our person.
[12]  In the previous chapter we saw that the Christ who is being dispensed into us is God, the Spirit, and life.
[13]  Christ, God, the Spirit, and life are all mysterious, abstract, intangible, and invisible.
[14]  The Bible is tangible, for we can see it and read it, yet the reality, the living, prevailing element, within the Bible is Christ Himself, who is God Rom 9:5 , the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 , and life John 14:6 .
[15]  When we take the words of the Bible into us, we immediately have the sensation and the conviction that we have received Christ into us, because Christ is embodied in God s word.
[16]  Now we need to see what the real content of the word is.
[17]  The contents of God s word are mainly Christ, the death of Christ, and the resurrection of Christ.
[18]  These elements are Christ s death and Christ s resurrection, both of which are in Christ.
[19]  The Bible is not a book of ethics; it is the word of God, composed of Christ as life, His death as the killing element, and His resurrection as the nourishing element.
[20]  Whenever we read or study the Bible, if we do not receive Christ, His death, and His resurrection, our reading or our studying is vain.
[21]  Formerly, the Spirit of God was only the divine Spirit, but He has become the Spirit of Jesus Christ a compound Spirit, compounded with Christ s divinity, humanity, death, and resurrection.
[22]  BEING THE RECOVERY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21; Col 3:4, 10-11
[23]  We may be accustomed to speaking about the recovery, yet I am concerned that even those who have been in the church for many years do not adequately know what the Lord s recovery is.
[24]  Others may define the Lord s recovery as the recovery of the proper church life, but the proper church life also is Christ.
[25]  God s eternal purpose and His economy is to work Christ into His chosen people so that they may become the Body of Christ.
[26]  We need to see that the Lord s recovery is to recover Christ and that God s eternal purpose and His economy is to work Christ, to dispense Christ, into our being to make us a part of Christ, the Body of Christ.
[27]  Because Christ is our life Col 3:4 , our person 3:10-11 , our love, our kindness, our humility, our long-suffering, our holiness, our righteousness, and our everything, we are Christ.
[28]  This does not mean that we are not Christ when we are evil and that we are Christ when we are good.
[29]  Christianity has Christ only in name and very little in reality.
[30]  Instead of Christ, Christianity is composed mainly of four categories of things.
[31]  There are many doctrines concerning Christ and many activities for the work of Christ, but Christ Himself is missing.
[32]  As branches of Christ, we should preach Christ not by rock music, dramas, or any other method, but by living Christ, growing Christ, and producing Christ.
[33]  They do not care for movies, bars, or dancing; they care only for Christ.
[34]  As branches of Christ, we should do nothing but live Christ.
[35]  We need to go only where we can receive more of Christ, and we need to take only the way by which we will receive more of Christ.
[36]  When we contact Christ, live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ, Christ surely will not lead us to a theater, a bar, or a dancing club.
[37]  CHAPTER FOUR WALKING IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gal 1:13-16; 2:20; 4:19; Col 1:12, 15, 18-19; 2:9, 2b, 16-17; 3:10-11, 4; 1:27; 2:6-7 THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST
[38]  First, Christ is revealed in us, second, Christ lives in us, and third, Christ is formed in us.
[39]  This portion is the image of the invisible God v. 15 . He is the portion to us, yet He is the image of the invisible God, and He is the embodiment of God v. 19 . Colossians 2:9 says, "In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." Christ is also the mystery of God v. 2b . God is a mystery, and this mystery is Christ Himself.
[40]  The all-inclusive Christ, who is God, man, the Creator 1:16 , a creature v. 15b , the Firstborn in resurrection v. 18b , the Head of the Body, the beginning v. 18a , and every positive thing, is now our life 3:4 . If we weep, it does not mean that we have less life, and if we laugh, it does not mean that we have more life.
[41]  Thus far, we have seen the Christ revealed in Colossians mainly in a doctrinal way.
[42]  Now we need to see the experience of this Christ.
[43]  Colossians 2:6-7 says, As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him, and being established in the faith even as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
[44]  We received Christ when we opened our being, repented, confessed our sins to Him, and said, Lord Jesus, I believe into You.
[45]  When we are newly saved, we may not know that Christ is the life-giving Spirit or that we have a human spirit.
[46]  Christ is the all-inclusive One who includes both God and man, yet we can walk in Him, for He is now the Spirit in our spirit.
[47]  If we practice this, we will experience the Lord every day, and when we come to the meetings, we will come in Christ and with Christ with the rich experiences of Christ.
[48]  CHAPTER FIVE GOD S ECONOMY AND GODLINESS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:3-7; 3:15-16; 2:2; 4:7-8; 6:3, 11; 2 Tim 3:12 DROPPING ALL OUR CONCEPTS AND CARING ONLY
[49]  We all need to learn to have no concepts in the Lord s recovery.
[50]  We need to allow Christ to saturate our being, occupy our being, and replace all our concepts.
[51]  In our daily life, our marriage life, our family life, our school life, and especially our church life, the solution to every problem is Christ.
[52]  If we care only for Christ and the church, we will be under the Lord s blessing and on the line of His economy every day, always enjoying life, peace, and grace.
[53]  God s Economy Being God Coming into Us and Godliness Being God Going Out of Us
[54]  A FURTHER WORD CONCERNING GODLINESS Leading a Life in All Godliness
[55]  First Timothy 2:2 says that we need to lead a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness.
[56]  The kind of pictures we hang in our bedroom may indicate whether or not we care for godliness in our private life.
[57]  First Timothy 4:7-8 says, Exercise yourself unto godliness.
[58]  CHAPTER SIX THE LAW OF FREEDOM Scripture Reading: Heb 8:10-11; Rom 6:14; 1 Cor 9:21, 26-27; James 1:25; 2:12; 2 Tim 1:7; 4:22 FELLOWSHIPPING CONCERNING
[59]  In the previous chapter we learned the definitions of the terms God s economy and godliness.
[60]  Christians are not lawless people; we are the most lawful people on the earth.
[61]  In everything we are under the commandments of the New Testament, the new law, which is the law of Christ and the law of freedom.
[62]  First, we need to spend time in the Word every day, for the word in the Bible embodies God, Christ, the Spirit, and life.
