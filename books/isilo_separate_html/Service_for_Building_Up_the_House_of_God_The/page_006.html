<p>The only thing that God does concerning man&rsquo;s service is to send His fire to burn within man. To serve God and to work for Him mean that man is joined to God and is mingled with God. It seems as though man is serving God. However, the service comes out of God; it does not originate in man. The service is God moving through man. Without the human element, there cannot be service. However, if there is only the human element, the service is not acceptable to God. In order for our service to have spiritual value and be acceptable to God, He must move through us and serve through us. This is the purpose of the altar. God is calling those who love Him and desire to satisfy His heart&rsquo;s desire to offer themselves on the altar.</p>
<p>In Romans 12:1 the apostle Paul exhorts us to present our bodies a living sacrifice. This means that we must pay the price to forsake everything of ourselves. If we are willing to present ourselves on the altar, the divine fire will come down on us and pass through us. The issue of this burning will be our service, our work. On the one hand, such a work may be considered our work because we have a part in it; on the other hand, it is not our work because it is not out of us. This work is God working through us by being joined to us.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it was Peter who stood up on the day of Pentecost to preach the gospel (Acts 2:14-41); on the other hand, it was God who preached the gospel. It was the fire of God burning in Peter and speaking through Peter. This is an example of man being gained by God and of God being gained by man. God and man were joined and mingled together.</p>
<p>This is the service that God desires. When iron is being purified in fire, the iron seems to be swallowed up by the fire, but at the same time, the fire seems to burn in the iron. The iron becomes red because fire is burning in the iron. Then the fire burns wherever the iron is placed. We may say that it is a rod of iron, or we may say that it is a ball of fire. The fire and the iron become one. This is an illustration of the Christian service and work.</p>
<p>Genuine Christian service is not of man. Rather, genuine Christian service is God moving through man. God does not force man to receive Him. God has erected an altar, and those who are willing, those who love Him, may come forward willingly to be dealt with, broken, and placed on the altar. Such a person can say, &ldquo;Lord, here I am. My only desire is to satisfy Your need.&rdquo; If we would offer ourselves sincerely in this way, fire will descend from heaven and burn us. This burning will become the energy that moves us. The issue of this burning will be our service. God wants His fire to burn in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD COMING<br />
TO CAST FIRE ON THE EARTH</h2>
<p>Some of us might say that the Lord Jesus came to the earth &ldquo;to seek and to save that which is lost&rdquo; (Luke 19:10). Others might quote another verse and say that &ldquo;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:15). This also is a wonderful verse. Some might quote John 10:10, which says, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&rdquo; We are familiar with these verses. However, in Luke 12:49 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I have come to cast fire on the earth.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus came to the earth not only to save us but to cause fire to burn on us. &ldquo;I have come to cast fire on the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord cast fire on the earth so that it might be kindled. Therefore, the Lord continued, &ldquo;How I wish that it were already kindled!&rdquo; (v. 49). The Lord desired that the fire would be kindled in people. Verse 50 says, &ldquo;I have a baptism to be baptized with.&rdquo; The baptism with which the Lord was to be baptized was His death on the cross. If the Lord had not died, the fire would not have been cast down. The Lord had to die. He had to take up the cross, go to the altar, and present Himself as a burnt offering.</p>
<p>If the Lord had not placed Himself in the Father&rsquo;s hand, the fire could not have been cast to the earth. This fire is the Spirit. When the Lord Jesus went to the cross and suffered death, He was gained by God, and God poured out the Spirit as fire from heaven. This fire descended on the hundred and twenty disciples and burned in them. All the service in the New Testament age comes out of that burning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRE ON THE ALTAR BURNING AND<br />
PRODUCING A POWERFUL SERVICE</h2>
<p>Now we will consider how to apply this fellowship. We need to know what the Christian service is and what the work of the church is. We cannot start a service or initiate a work simply because we like it or are enthusiastic. To do so would be to serve God with strange fire, because the service would be of man, not of God. Strange fire is unacceptable to God. It is not what He wants.</p>
<p>The service that God desires is carried out through the fire on the altar of burnt offering. The altar of burnt offering has already been set up, and fire has also descended upon it. The altar of burnt offering is the cross of the Lord Jesus, and the fire is the Spirit. The Spirit has descended and is burning through the cross as the altar of burnt offering. Any person who is willing to touch the cross, that is, to receive the cross by applying the death of Christ, will be gained by God. Then the fire on the altar of burnt offering, that is, the Spirit, will burn in him until it produces a service. All genuine service comes out of such a burning.</p>
<p>There was a young brother who was born into a good family and was loved by his parents. One day he learned of the salvation of the cross and received it. Then something unexplainable happened in him; the fire of the Spirit burned in him. The more he prayed and the closer he drew to the Lord, the more the fire burned within him. Finally, he said, &ldquo;Lord, I consecrate myself to You willingly. I do not care about my future, and I do not care about my possessions. I am willing to be wrecked, slain, and broken. I am willing to meet Your need and let my life be terminated on the cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more he prayed, the stronger the fire burned within him. The fire became so intense that the young brother would weep for unsaved sinners around him. The zeal burning in him and moving him was so intense that he had to preach the gospel. He was beside himself for the gospel. This was an experience of the fire on the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<p>When this young brother was about twenty years old, he was studying with a determination to achieve something in the future. Then one day he heard that a young lady would be preaching the gospel in his town, and he was full of curiosity because at that time in northern China it was unheard of for a young lady to preach the gospel in public. Even though he was very busy, he went to listen to her because he wanted to see the situation.</p>
<p>The young lady spoke concerning how God needs man and wants to gain man and how Satan usurps man in order to prevent God from gaining man. She spoke from the book of Exodus. Her words penetrated the young brother, and every sentence burned in him.</p>
<p>He forgot that he was there as a spectator, and his inner being was subdued by her speaking. He confessed that he wanted to be gained by God. After listening to the message, he believed in the Lord, was saved, and his life changed. He said, &ldquo;Even if Satan would give me the whole world, I do not want it. I do not want anything. I want to forsake the world. I want to leave Egypt, which is under Pharaoh&rsquo;s usurpation. Satan, the Pharaoh of this world, has usurped me. I want to go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the Lord&rsquo;s grace, many years later this brother served God together with the sister who had preached the gospel to him. That was when he learned of how she was saved. She believed in the Lord while attending a Christian school. Later, she was revived and consecrated herself to serve the Lord after hearing the gospel from another young woman. Those who are acquainted with the history of Christianity in China know that in the early part of the twentieth century a woman by the name of Dora Yu was greatly used by the Lord. Dora Yu was a native of Chekiang Province.</p>
<p>Sister Yu grew up in a wealthy family and received a good education from her youth. After she graduated from medical school, her parents sent her to England to further her studies. While she was on the ship sailing to England, she spent much time with the Lord in prayer and was brought by the Lord to the altar. As soon as she was placed on the altar, the fire of the Spirit began to burn in her. By the time her ship was in the Mediterranean Sea, the fire within her was burning so fiercely that she felt she could not go to England to study.</p>
<p>Sister Yu wondered how she could turn back, because her parents had already spent a large sum of money to pay for her travel expenses and tuition. In those days, it was extremely difficult to be trained as a medical doctor. Nevertheless, the fire kept burning within her, urging her to get off the ship and return to China in order to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>When the ship arrived at Marseille, Sister Yu told the captain that she had to go back to China. Although the people on the ship thought that she was crazy, she got off the ship in Marseille and found another ship going to China.</p>
<p>When she returned home, her family was very disappointed. They asked her why she decided to return home. The more she explained her desire to preach the gospel to the Chinese people, the more her family considered her to be crazy. They said that her believing in Jesus had caused her to become confused and insane.</p>
<p>Her family and relatives tried to counsel her, but they could not change her mind. The more she prayed, the more intensely the fire burned within her. Eventually, her family let her leave home. Under the burning of the fire of the Spirit, Sister Yu went to Shanghai, where she was without a home. She wanted to preach Jesus so that people might repent and be saved.</p>
<p>Sister Yu met someone who loved the Lord and who, understanding her desire, rented a house for her. Then she began to preach the gospel. As a result of the fire of the Spirit burning within her, her preaching of the gospel was powerful. Afterward, she went to preach the gospel in Foochow, and Brother Watchman Nee was saved through her preaching. Some have testified that while she was preaching from the podium, those listening to her wept. They wept so hard that there were puddles of tears on the floor. Through preaching the gospel she was able to lead many to repentance and salvation, and others were revived.</p>
<p>Our work is related to that burning of the Spirit within Sister Dora Yu. This work was produced out of the burning of the Spirit. Human initiation, promotion, discussion, or motivation are not the basis of genuine service to God. The basis of genuine service is knowing the cross and placing ourselves on the cross in order to be gained by God and to allow the divine fire to burn within us. This produces service.</p>
<p>Such service is the burning of incense in the Holy Place, is accepted by God, brings man to God, and joins God to man and heaven to earth. Such a work is of God, passes through God, and goes back to God. This work comes from God to man, it brings man to touch God, and it brings God to pass through man. The continual cycle of coming from God to man and from man to God is the story of the burning of the fire of the Spirit. The only basis for this burning is our being on the altar.</p>
<p>The saints who pray and apply the death of the cross will receive grace from God, and His holy fire will burn within them. Such saints do not care for themselves or set their mind on themselves but care only to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire. Their work will be the issue of God moving through man. Their work will be a sweet smelling fragrance to God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
