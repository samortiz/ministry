   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE EXPERIENCING CHRIST BY FAITH Scripture Reading: Eph 3:17; John 14:19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The experience of Christ as life revealed in the Bible is not easily understood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Often our concept of this matter is absolutely different from what the Bible reveals.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because God is so great and holy and we are so small and common, we may hold the concept that the experience of Christ as life must be something spectacular.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In actuality, however, it is not extraordinary, but very normal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND THE SPIRITUAL WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the universe, there are two worlds: the physical world and the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The physical world is easily realized by everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But unless one has revelation, he will not be able to realize the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to realize something of these two worlds, we need to look into the books of Daniel and Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book of Daniel reveals that each of the nations has a "prince."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The princes of Persia and Grecia Dan 10:13, 20 are the fallen angels who followed Satan in his rebellion Rev 12:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ultimately, these angels along with Satan will be thrown into the lake of fire which has been prepared for them Matt 25:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both Daniel and Isaiah also reveal that in the spiritual world there are two sides: God's side and Satan's side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These two sides were in existence long before the creation of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The relationship between the physical and spiritual worlds is clearly seen in Isaiah 14.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This chapter describes the king of Babylon, but this description of him is also a description of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This one description represents two persons the king of Babylon and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, these two persons were one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan was the power behind the king of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is an angelic power behind every human government.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At Daniel's time, the prince of Persia, an angel who followed Satan in his rebellion, withstood Michael the archangel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a prince behind every worldly power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today there are angels behind the warring countries of the Middle East.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The archangel Michael is the power behind the nation of Israel Dan 10:13, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This invisible power behind the visible world power illustrates that the situation on earth always has two aspects: the outward, physical aspect and the inward, spiritual aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Genesis 3 is another illustration of the outward and inward aspects of things on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Genesis 3:1 apparently there was only a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, a serpent was there outwardly, but Satan was there inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The serpent was visible; Satan was invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The serpent and Satan had become one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Revelation 12:9 calls Satan "the ancient serpent."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Genesis, there was a physical serpent, but in Revelation, that physical serpent has become a spiritual serpent, even a dragon 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While there is the talk about the dragon physically, a great dragon does exist spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the garden of Eden, Satan was just a little serpent, but in Revelation 12 he becomes a great and powerful dragon vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>3-4, 7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today the entire world is under the authority of Satan, the ruler of this world John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11 , but no one can see him because he is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He operates in man and through man, but he remains invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan operated in Judas Iscariot.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John 6 the Lord Jesus said that Judas, the one who betrayed Him, was a devil vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>70-71 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan entered into Judas John 13:2, 26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This made him a devil.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Apparently, Judas as a man was the betrayer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually, the real betrayer was the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this universe, God enters into man to be one with man, and Satan, God's enemy, enters into man to be one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From Genesis to Revelation, these two different activities are going on: God's mingling with man and Satan's mingling with man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Finally, at the end of the age, Satan will fully give himself to the man called Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Antichrist and Satan, the dragon, will become one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Their oneness is indicated by the fact that both the dragon and Antichrist have seven heads and ten horns Rev 12:3; 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In contrast to the oneness of Satan and Antichrist is the oneness of God and man in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The New Jerusalem will be the blending of God with man.</S>
