In between these two groups of three books, there are three pairs of books: 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, and 1 and 2 Chronicles
The Bible actually tells us only one thing-God's eternal economy according to the good pleasure of His heart's desire
God is surely the best writer, and He uses pictures in the first thirty-nine books of His writing in the Bible
The greatest type in the Old Testament is the history of the people of Israel, who typify God's people on earth today
When we come to the twelve books of history in the Old Testament, we should not be distracted by the history presented in these books
To answer this question we need to realize that the entire Bible is for God's economy with Christ as the reality, the center, and the goal
In our reading of the books of history, we need to pray and seek the proper interpretation of all the types and prophecies in these books
The repetition in these two portions might be a proof that 1 and 2 Chronicles were written by Ezra, the writer of the book of Ezra
Let us consider, for example, the dispute over Palestine, that is, over the good land, that has been going on for hundreds of years
The Jews say that Palestine is the land of their forefathers, and the Arabs claim that it is the land of their forefathers
The decision regarding the good land will not be made by statesmen; it will be made by the One who is in the heavens
Now we need to pray that the Lord will give us a new revival, a revival which has never been seen in man's history
Such a revival will be something new, for it is related to God's 'hobby,' to His good pleasure, to the desire of His heart
Israel was divided into two nations the northern kingdom called the kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom called the kingdom of Judah
The matters covered in the life-study of 1 and 2 Samuel and in the life-study of 1 and 2 Kings will not be repeated here
God's hobby was far from complete because at that time man had only God's image and God's likeness but not God's life and God's nature
Later He repaired and restored the ruined creation, and as the last work in His restoration and further creation, God created man, His hobby
After Adam's fall and after promising Eve that He would come as the seed of the woman , God waited thousands of years before becoming a man
One day the Lord Jesus, the God-man, said that He was a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die in order to become many grains
Such a reproduction makes God happy because His reproduction looks like Him, speaks like Him, and lives like Him
Perhaps in the morning they live by God's life, but later in the day they may lose their temper and live like a scorpion
Suppose a certain brother who has been living like a scorpion realizes that, as a child of God, he is God in life and in nature
If all of today's Christians realized that they were God in life and in nature, the whole world would be different
On the one hand, outwardly God as the Ruler of the universe has done many things so that people from everywhere in the world can be blended
On the other hand, God has a recovery on earth, and His recovery has been under His leading for seventy-two years
During these years He has released thousands of printed messages, and these messages are in thousands of homes
Such publications have reached many nations, and we believe that the Lord will use them to gain what He desires
Because fundamental Christianity has become stale, it has lost its impact and effect, like salt which has become tasteless
According to this hymn, it is a great miracle and a deep mystery that God has a way to be joined to man and mingled with man
Ultimately the holy city, Jerusalem, will be the aggregate of all the visions and revelations throughout the Scriptures
Divinity and humanity will become a mutual abode, and the glory of God will be expressed in humanity radiantly in splendor to the uttermost
The genealogy of Esau is not in the lineage of the genealogy of Christ as recorded in Matthew 1:1-17 and Luke 3:23-38
Thirteen sons of David were born during his reign in Jerusalem for thirty-three years, including Solomon, born of Bath-shua
We should cry out to God, telling Him that we want to gain more of Christ, possess more of Christ, and enjoy more of Christ
One of the sons of Levi was Kohath, one of the sons of Kohath was Amram, and Amram's sons were Aaron and Moses, and his daughter was Miriam
They attended to their office, and their brothers the Levites were given to all the service of the tabernacle of the house of God
In typology this signifies the church service, in which everything must be set in order by the arrangement of the Spirit
In this message we have presented simply a general idea of the genealogy from Adam to the twelve tribes of Israel
The nation of Israel should not be listed with the nations, because it was among the nations but not with the nations
God used His elect Israel as a type to signify that, among fallen mankind, God would have a people to come in the future
When we think of ourselves as God-men, this thinking, this realization, revolutionizes us in our daily experience
When we realize that we are God-men, we will say, 'Lord, You are the first God-man, and we are the many God-men following You
The spiritual significances of all the materials provided by David are covered in the life-study of 1 Kings 5-7
According to the record of the New Testament, Christ lived a fighting life, fighting mainly against God's enemy Satan
Chapters twenty-three through twenty-six are a record of David's arrangement of the order of the services of the priests and the Levites
We need to realize that there is an order in the Body of Christ, with the various members set in a particular place
The services of the descendants of the three sons of Levi- Gershon, Kohath, and Merari-are described in 23:2-23
The rest of the Levites, both old and young, cast lots for their duty even as their brothers the sons of Aaron
If they behaved properly before God, they would enjoy the land and leave the land as an inheritance to their children
They had received so much from God, and what they had received they offered back to God for the building of the house of God
All Israel obeyed him, with all the leaders and mighty men and all the sons of King David submitting themselves to Solomon the king
Although Rehoboam was capable and wise, he did not labor for God's interest on the earth to build up the kingdom of God
He worked for his own interest, transmuting the kingdom of God into a monarchy not only for himself but also for his descendants
The kingdom of his father Solomon was glorious and splendid, but not long after Rehoboam began to reign, he lost nearly the entire kingdom
He remained on the proper ground in Jerusalem and he believed and kept the teachings of Moses according to God's revelation
If you are for your interest, you make the local church a monarchy, your own little empire, not a part of the kingdom of God
Abijah and Judah took the fundamental standing, and Abijah advised Jeroboam not to fight against them with whom Jehovah stood
Jeroboam and the children of Israel were defeated by Abijah and the children of Judah, and Jehovah struck Jeroboam to death
Abijah also indulged in sexual lust by marrying fourteen wives and begetting twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters
Asa's further reforms were accomplished through the advice and encouragement of the prophet Azariah the son of Oded
The people had fallen to such an extent that they had given up the altar of God and had built altars for the worship of idols
They also entered into a covenant to pursue Jehovah and covenanted that anyone who did not pursue Jehovah would be put to death
Jehoshaphat set up judges throughout all the fortified cities of Judah to take care of the cases of the people
There was a good priest taking care of the worship of God and a good ruler taking care of governmental matters
In 20:1-30 we see that Jehoshaphat defeated the great army of the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir by trusting in Jehovah
Jehoshaphat set his face to pursue Jehovah and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah, and all the cities of Judah came to seek Jehovah
Jehoshaphat prayed to Jehovah in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem with their little ones, wives, and children
From the cases of the kings covered in this message, we need to learn to be very careful to behave ourselves properly
God's dealing with His people in the details of their living is for His people to enjoy the good land, Christ, in a very proper way
Brother Watchman Nee, who was raised up by the Lord more than seventy years ago, read the Bible thoroughly again and again
They know that as long as they believe in the Lord Jesus, they are saved and may have the assurance that they have been saved
Nee continued to fight for the truth and eventually he released the truth regarding Christ as our life and our taking Christ as life
Even the New Jerusalem is a sign, the last and consummate sign, signifying the ultimate consummation of God's economy
The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods'
Today God is dealing with us not according to the law but according to the compound, life-giving, indwelling, consummated Spirit
Today we are required by the New Testament to conduct ourselves according to the compound, life-giving, all-inclusive Spirit
He became angry with the seer who rebuked him for trusting in the king of Syria instead of trusting in Jehovah
Lord, we praise You that we are living in this most blessed day, the day that will close this age and bring You back
God's choosing of this ground according to His ordination is clearly seen in Deuteronomy 12, a chapter that we need to study carefully
We may say that God's choice of Jerusalem as the worship center began with His word to Abraham in Genesis 22:2
God told Abraham to go to the land of Moriah and to offer Isaac upon one of the mountains of which God would tell him
The place-Mount Moriah-where Abraham offered Isaac was also the site-Mount Zion-selected by God for the temple
The kings of Judah remained on the proper ground, Jerusalem, chosen by God, but the kings of Israel abandoned the God-ordained ground
The kings of Judah were right in two things: remaining on the proper ground and keeping the fundamental faith in God's Word
The proper ground and the fundamental faith were attractions for a good number of God's people, especially the priests and the Levites
During the reign of Rehoboam, the Levites abandoned their pasture lands and their property and went to Jerusalem
Later, during the reign of Asa, 'many from Israel threw in their lot with him when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him'
They were attracted to Jerusalem because the kings of Judah stood on the proper ground and kept the fundamental faith
In the Old Testament history books we can see many different pictures, but we may not have an accurate interpretation of these pictures
We must also pay attention to our interest, our intention, our purpose, our goal, our attitude, and our way of speaking
The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles give us many examples of how the kings of Judah conducted themselves in the good land
You are on the proper ground of the church and you keep the fundamental faith, but how do you speak to your spouse?
If we live a crucified life in our married life, then in our married life we will have the living of a God-man
At dinner the husband may criticize his wife for her attitude, and she may condemn him for his way of speaking
All the vital members should be God-men, crucified in their natural life to live a God-man life by the divine life within them
The highest attainment of pursuing Christ is to reign with Christ in His divine life through His abounding grace
Jehoram, a descendant of David and Solomon, was warned by Elijah the prophet concerning his evils before God and his miserable end
He did well in three directions: with the people, with God, and with the house of God, keeping the house of God during a time of rebellion
Forgetting all the kindness that had been shown to him, Joash was in company with those who conspired to put the son of Jehoiada to death
A man of God advised Amaziah not to fight with the help of the army of Israel, because God was not with Israel
Amaziah strengthened himself to fight the children of Edom with his own people and defeated them, capturing some of them
Uzziah defeated the Philistines, the Arabians, and the Meunim by the help of God, and the Ammonites gave tribute to him
When Uzziah became strong, his heart became uplifted to trespass against Jehovah and go into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense
According to God's ordination in the Old Testament, the kings were not allowed to touch the duties of the priests
Oded seemed to be saying that after defeating Ahaz, they should not have captured so many women and young people
Before Hezekiah came into his reign, Israelites put idols into that temple, and in verse 5 these idols are called 'the impurity'
His charge indicates that after the devastation of the temple, the priests and the Levites were left with nothing to do
Hezekiah recovered the Passover by sending letters to all Israel and Judah telling them to come to Jerusalem to hold the Passover of Jehovah
He sent letters not only to the people of Judah but to all the people of Israel in order to keep the oneness of all God's elect
They listened to Hezekiah and the leaders, and then they took action according to God's word, according to God's revelation
The Feast of Unleavened Bread, which lasted seven days, was a continuation of the Passover, which lasted only one day
They removed the idolatrous altars that were in Jerusalem and they removed all the incense altars and threw them into the brook Kidron
Hezekiah prayed for many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun who ate the Passover yet had not cleansed themselves
Have you ever enjoyed the Lord's table so much on the Lord's Day that you had the Lord's table again the next day?
The children of Israel gave in abundance for the priests and the Levites in distribution according to their divisions
In 2 Chronicles there is no mention of Hezekiah's shortcomings, but within him there was something for his own interest and desire
Manasseh entreated Jehovah his God in his distress, humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed to Him
In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, Josiah began to seek after the God of David his father
He was only eight years of age when he became king, and in the eighth year of his reign he began to seek after God
In the twelfth year Josiah began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherim, the idols, and the molten images
Chronicles 36:20b-23 speaks of the duration of the captivity of Israel and the proclamation of their release by Cyrus
The examples of the kings of Judah show that God needed a people on the earth so that He could be incarnated in humanity
Some fundamental Christians may say the law of God consists mainly of the Ten Commandments , that is, the moral law
The first three commandments are directly concerned with God; the fourth concerns God's Sabbath day; and the fifth concerns our parents
These are the commandments not to murder, not to commit adultery, not to steal, not to bear false witness against others, and not to covet
These commandments, or laws, are brief, but they cover almost everything concerning our relationship with one another
The commandment about coveting, however, deals with an inward matter, and Paul could not keep himself from coveting
When you were a student, you might have seen someone with a nice pen, and immediately you coveted that pen, desiring to have it
Based upon the fact that the law is the testimony of God, a picture of God, we may say that the law is also a type of Christ
In studying the books of history in the Old Testament, we need to learn how to link these books to God's economy
The law is linked to God's economy because the law was given as God's portrait, God's picture, God's image, and God's testimony
As God's testimony the law is a type of Christ, who, being the image of God, is God's portrait, God's picture, God's testimony
Keeping the law by not killing, not committing adultery, not stealing, not lying, and not coveting is the living of a God-man
In the world we see not the life of a God-man but murder, adultery, fornication, stealing, lying, and coveting
If a married sister would live the life of a God-man in her married life, she would be a good wife, submitting herself to her husband
We also need to have a God-man living in the church life, especially in relation to what we call the vital groups
The children of Israel had only an outward law, but today we have something much stronger and much higher than the law
We have the all-inclusive, life-giving, compounded, consummated Spirit in us, who is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
In the church meetings we may live Christ, but do we live Christ at home with our husband or wife and with our children?
We need a real revival to be Godmen who live a life of always denying ourselves and being crucified to live Christ for the expression of God
The people of Israel, especially the kings, forsook God, turned to the idols, and set up centers of worship other than Jerusalem
Because of their standing, God still had a people on earth who stood with Him and who at least tried to keep His word
The condition of the kings of Judah did not match their standing on the unique ground and their fundamental belief
Certain ones take the proper ground and keep the fundamental faith, yet they live in the flesh, in the self, and in the natural man
The root of every rebellion that took place among us in the past seventy-two years has been this ugly and evil matter of ambition
The commandment regarding the honoring of parents was therefore ranked with the commandments which concerned their relationship with God
The ceremonial section was composed of the laws of the tabernacle, the offerings, the priesthood, and the feasts
The tabernacle typifies Christ as the embodiment of God for God's people to contact Him and to enter into Him for their enjoyment
The offerings typify Christ as all kinds of sacrifices to meet the need of God toward His people and the need of His people before Him
If they had lived according to the law of God, they would have been the expression of God, for to keep the law is to express God
There was given Him dominion, glory, and a kingdom that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him
His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
God as the Word who became flesh had only the outward appearance of the flesh of sin, not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin
In heaven Jesus sitting, Christ the Lord is there enthroned; As the man by God exalted, With God's glory He is crowned
In Matthew 26:64 the Lord Jesus said, 'You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven'
We know that if Christ is manifested, we will be like Him wholly, perfectly, and absolutely because we will see Him even as He is
The wall is jasper, the first foundation of the wall is jasper, the light of the city is jasper, and God on the throne is like jasper
When the people of Israel were about to enter into the land of Canaan, God charged them through Moses to slaughter all the Canaanites
He did not want them to forsake Him, the fountain of living water, and hew out cisterns which are broken and which cannot retain water
He wanted them to love one another and not to murder, not to commit adultery, not to steal, not to lie, and not to covet
The people of Israel failed God and eventually were divided into the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel
The kingdom of Israel became apostate; they forsook God and set up other worship centers in addition to the unique center at Jerusalem
The kingdom of Israel was captured by the Assyrians, and later the kingdom of Judah was captured by the Babylonians
The land was usurped and taken over by pagans, and the people of Israel were given by God as captives to the heathens
When Jeremiah saw all this, sitting on the top of Mount Zion and looking down at Jerusalem, he lamented bitterly
God assured him that the miserable situation of his country and his people, of the temple and the city, would last for just seventy years
God comforted Jeremiah by assuring him that just as He gave the people up to captivity, He would also bring them back from their captivity
As we have pointed out, this return was made possible through the secret preserving care of the hiding God in their captivity
One day the omnipresent and omnipotent God will appear as the Son of Man, who will come back to take possession of the earth
He will place His right foot on the sea and His left on the land , indicating that He has come to take possession of the earth and the sea
We need to remember that all the history of the people of Israel is a type, typifying the New Testament believers as God's elect
Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther are the last three books of the history of God's chosen people in the Old Testament after 1 and 2 Chronicles
Zerubbabel should have been the one to succeed the throne of David, but he was appointed to be the governor of Judah by Cyrus
If we would answer this question, we need to see that the law given through Moses was called the testimony because it is a portrait of God
The fifth commandment, concerning honoring our parents, ranks our parents with God and points to God as our origin
How wonderful our society would be if there were no killing, no adultery, no stealing, no lying, and no coveting
Such a people would surely be God's particular people, God's elect, separated unto Him and sanctified to the uttermost
After the man created by God became fallen, mankind fell lower and lower until, at Babel, they became rotten to the uttermost
The children of Israel failed God, breaking every one of the Ten Commandments and becoming the same as mankind
If they would have the enjoyment of Christ they must leave their captivity and come back to the proper ground where Christ the good land is
There would have been no way to accomplish this unless the children of Israel returned to the good land from their captivity
In this message we will consider the first return of the captivity, the return under the kingly leadership of Zerubbabel
The return of the captivity under the leadership of Zerubbabel was according to the decree of Cyrus king of Persia
Because Cyrus was such a person, in the book of Isaiah he is considered a servant of God to fulfill God's purpose
He handed over the vessels, by enumerating them to Sheshbazzar , the prince of Judah, to be brought back to Jerusalem for the house of God
Not only the returned captives but also the Jews who had not been captured came to Jerusalem to rebuild the altar
In the second month of the second year after their return, they began to rebuild the house of God with praise to Jehovah by the priests
The rebuilding work continued through the encouragement and help of the prophecies of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah
After the people stopped the work, they were encouraged by the prophets Haggai and Zechariah to continue the rebuilding work
The rebuilding was questioned and referred to Darius king of Persia by Tattenai, the governor beyond the River and his companions
In 6:1-12 we have Darius's checking of the decree of Cyrus and his confirmation to encourage and speed up the rebuilding
Today very few believers care for the building up of a proper local church in their locality as the house of God
He does have a home in the heavens with the angels, but He needs a home with the humanity of His heart's desire
For God to fulfill His promise, spoken through Jeremiah, that the captivity would last only for seventy years , He accomplished two returns
After this, the need shifted from the royal family to the priesthood, to Ezra, a descendant of the high priest Aaron
Ezra must have appealed to the king to give many of the Jews in his empire the freedom to go back to the land of their fathers
The Ten Commandments are the main items of the law, but all these commandments have their statutes, which give the details
The king permitted the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites to go to Jerusalem as they willed, with silver and gold and vessels
Without a person such as Ezra, who would have been qualified to maintain a proper order among the people in the good land?
To some extent, the king, the counselors, and the mighty officers might have realized that God was with the Jews
They arrived at Jerusalem and delivered all the silver, gold, and vessels to the house of God by weighing them
Chapters nine and ten are an account of the purification of the returned captives from the defilement of the foreign wives
God had charged the children of Israel, when they entered into the good land, not to have intermarriage with the peoples of the land
A proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of Israel to gather in Jerusalem within three days
It was also by His hand that God brought the children of Israel back from their captivity to the land of their forefathers
Often God is quiet, realizing that it is better that we do something because we have the capacity, as Ezra had
Whether the things are stirred up by Him or stirred up by us, He will be in them, stretching out His hand to do everything to help us
Later, He prophesied further He would come to be a seed of Abraham, which would be the blessing to all the nations
God first, through His continuous labor, took more than one thousand years to produce and form the nation of Israel as a great type
God's intention was to have Israel as His testimony, but according to their Egyptian culture they were a testimony of Egypt
After a short time, however, the children of Israel no longer expressed God, and He let them die in the wilderness
It was fitting for him to take the lead in the first return from captivity, because he had the capacity to administrate and to govern
Ezra called the people together and confessed not only his own sin but also the sin of Israel, to bring them back to the Word of God
Paul tells us that certain elders may not have a job but may 'labor in word and teaching' and therefore should be supported by the church
Calling on the Lord is necessary, and we need to have such a practice in our daily life, but calling on the Lord's name is not a truth
If they are asked about the difference between sanctification and renewing, they may not be able to explain the difference
We have almost completed the life-study of the Scriptures, and we have begun what we call the crystallization study
It would be unseemly for an elder to make decisions and expect the saints to follow them but not visit the saints with the truths
The real eldership is to visit the saints and to shepherd them, feed them, and take care of them by speaking to them concerning the truths
These were the vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had brought out from Jerusalem and had put in the house of his gods
The whole book is a record of Nehemiah's trust in God for his comfort in the trials and attacks of his enemies
The leaders of the Moabites and Ammonites were greatly displeased about Nehemiah's seeking the good of the children of Israel
Nehemiah answered them by saying, 'The God of heaven Himself will make us prosper; therefore we His servants will rise up and build
Chapter three is a record of the building of the wall in consecutive sections by all the children of Israel with the priests and Levites
The Jews built the wall, and all the wall was joined together to half its height, for they had a heart to work
Today, no matter how much we may be mocked and despised, we should have a heart to build and should be aggressive
The enemies were angry because the building work was advancing, and they conspired to come and fight against Jerusalem
Some built the wall and some carried burdens, taking the loads with one hand doing the work and with the other hand holding a weapon
The one who would sound the trumpet was beside Nehemiah, to gather them to fight, trusting that their God would fight for them
On the one hand, the children of Israel were prepared to fight; on the other hand, they trusted in God that He would fight for them
Nehemiah and his brothers did not eat the food appointed for the governor for twelve years because of the fear of God
He was not selfish, he did not seek his own interests, and he was not indulgent in sexual lust like all the kings, including David
They also slandered and threatened to weaken their hands from working, but Nehemiah prayed to God, saying, 'Now strengthen my hands'!
Lastly, God put it into Nehemiah's heart to enroll the returned captives by genealogy for the increase of the population of Jerusalem
Nehemiah received help from God to carry out a great success in the work of rebuilding the wall of the city of Jerusalem
In this message we will consider Nehemiah's aggressiveness and the need for the proper aggressiveness in the Lord's recovery today
There was a need for some of the captivity to come back from Babylon to Jerusalem to lay a foundation for the formation of a nation
There was the need of teaching and education to bring the people of God into a culture that was according to God
Such a culture was not an Egyptian kind nor a Canaanite kind nor a Babylonian kind but was God's kind, a culture that expressed God
If the government of a country is constituted not only organizationally but also organically, that government will not be lifeless
Later, there was a second return from captivity under the priestly leadership of Ezra, a descendant of the priestly family
Although he did not have any rank there in Persia, he was bold, strong, and aggressive in presenting a petition to the king of Persia
If Ezra had not had such a standing in the eyes of the king, the king would not have authorized him to appoint magistrates and judges
Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' graves, lies in waste and its gates are consumed with fire'?
The king asked him what his request was, and Nehemiah asked the king to send him to Judah that he might rebuild the city of his fathers
Nehemiah went on to request that letters would be given to him for the governors so that they would let him pass through
In principle, these three sections-government, education, and constitution-have been present in the Lord's recovery through the centuries
If there were seven hundred aggressive ones in each continent, a great deal would issue forth for the carrying out of God's economy
When the king asked him about his sad face, he spoke to the king in a bold, aggressive way about his burden for the city of Jerusalem
In typology many persons were temporarily used by God according to their natural capacity and natural virtues to signify something spiritual
If we allow our natural capacity, ability, and virtues to be brought to the cross and die, we will be resurrected
In resurrection our capability, ability, and virtues will be many times greater than they were in the natural life
In ourselves we are natural, but when we are transferred out of ourselves into God, who is resurrection, we enter into resurrection
They eventually realized that in the recovery there was no ground for them to employ their natural capacity and ability
We need to be clear about this in order to understand the intrinsic significance of the type according to the insight given by the Spirit
We all have our own kind of disposition and habitual behavior, but God is able to reconstitute us through His word
When the word of God works within us, the Spirit, through the word, spontaneously dispenses God's nature with God's element into our being
After they returned to the land of their fathers to be citizens of the nation of Israel, they needed a reconstitution
Ezra was very useful at this point, for he was one through whom the people could be reconstituted with the word of God
It was hard for the people to do this, because they had been convinced and subdued by the word to realize they were sinful
All the assembly did it accordingly for seven days with great rejoicing, and day by day Ezra read in the book of the law of God
In chapters nine and ten the people made a clear confession to God of their past and made a firm covenant with God
They confessed that, with a stiffened neck and a stubborn shoulder, they had cast God's law behind their back and had slain His prophets
According to God's ordination in His law, in the seventh year they were to give up sowing and reaping so that the land would have rest
In the seventh year they were not allowed to use the land, and they were not permitted to exact payment for every debt
For those who were unwilling to lend to the poor, God had many ways to balance the social wealth among the rich and the poor
The wild Israel was reconstituted with a divine constitution to be a separate particular sanctified people as a testimony of God on earth
The first section contains pictures, while the second section contains the fulfillment of what is signified by the pictures
The main serving ones for the worshipping of God were the priests with the Levites, who were the servants of the priests
In verses 1 through 21 we have a record of those faithful ones who went up from Babylon to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel and Joshua
During the dedication the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they also purified the people, the gates, and the wall
Nehemiah appointed two great companies to give thanks to God, to go in procession, and to stand in the house of God with him
The reconstitution also included the appointment of the services of the priests and the Levites and the supply of their needs
Nehemiah not only brought the serving Levites and priests into function; he also supplied their daily necessities
When Nehemiah perceived the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, he was grieved and would not tolerate the situation
According to verses 10 through 13, Nehemiah went on to remove the negligence in taking care of the need of the Levites
He found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them and he contended with the rulers regarding this
In verses 23 through 30a the people and especially the priests were cleansed from the defilement of their marriages with the nations
Nehemiah required those who married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab to separate themselves from their foreign wives
Lastly, Nehemiah appointed duties for the priests and the Levites, for the wood offering at the appointed times, and for the firstfruits
In doing all these things Nehemiah asked God to remember him and spare him according to the greatness of His lovingkindness
The leaders of the returned captivity were Zerubbabel of the royal family, Ezra of the priestly family, and Nehemiah of a common family
Even though he was a common person without a rank such as that of a king or of a captain in the army he took care of Gods interest on earth
Ezra, who was famous for his knowledge of the Word of God, was still alive, and Nehemiah was willing to go to Ezra for help
To reconstitute the people of God is to educate them by putting them into the Word of God that they may be saturated with the Word
How could a people with a constitution of Egyptian, Babylonian, and Canaanite culture be God's testimony, the expression of the God-man?
In addition to being re-educated, the people of Israel needed to be raised up in much the same way as parents raise their children
Parents not only educate their children but spontaneously and unconsciously impart themselves, nearly their whole being, into their children
They were transfused with the thought of God, with the considerations of God, and with all that God is, making them God's reproduction
The returned captives became God's testimony through the reconstitution which took place under the leadership of Nehemiah
The central and crucial point of the recovery books, which end with Nehemiah, is the matter of proper, adequate leadership
Esther is a sweet book, covering, as its central subject, the secret care and the open salvation of the hiding God in Israel's captivity
Because God's people became degraded and rotten, God disciplined and punished them by handing them over as slaves to the Gentile nations
Even when the captives of Israel were in the lowest situation, at the bottom, Christ was among them, suffering with them
Cyrus the king of Persia was even called Gods shepherd one who would fulfill His desire and His anointed one who would serve Gods purpose
The king commanded that the queen come before him wearing the royal crown in order that he might present her to those attending the banquet
Finally, in His secret care the hiding God raised up Esther, a Jewish orphan virgin, to be crowned by the top king as his queen
Esther saved the king from being assassinated, telling the king in Mordecai's name of those who planned to assassinate him
We did not know what to expect, but the hiding God intervened in a wonderful way using a particular person as an Esther
Today we need to realize that the omnipotent God whom we are serving is still hiding Himself, especially when He is helping us
In 4:1 through 8:2 we have an account of Mordecai's confrontation of Haman's plot through Esther's close and intimate contact with the king
Although they fasted for their supplication to God, contrary to what we would expect, in verse 16 there is no mention of the name of God
While Esther and all the Jews were fasting, Haman, under the plot with his wife and friends, made a gallows on which to hang Mordecai
The king could not sleep, so he gave orders to have the book of the records of the chronicles brought, and they were read before him
The king immediately sentenced Haman to death and commanded his men to hang Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai
Throughout every province and every city, wherever the king's decree came, the Jews had gladness, joy, a feast, and a good day
In Susa the capital in two days the Jews destroyed eight hundred of their enemies and they hanged Haman's ten sons upon the gallows
In the provinces the Jews assembled and destroyed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them, thus having rest from their enemies
These days were to be days of feasting and rejoicing and of sending portions to one another and gifts to the poor
The appointment and the establishment of the Purim was confirmed by Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew in writing with all authority
If all the Jews had been destroyed, there would have been no lineage of Christ's genealogy for Christ to be brought into humanity
Finally, the story of the book of Esther is to keep a people for the possessing of the holy land for the coming kingdom of Christ
God brought back a small number of His people to possess the holy land as a base for Christ to come back to establish His kingdom on earth
Paul rebuked the Corinthian believers in his first Epistle to them by telling them that they were trying to divide Christ
There were various parties in Corinth who were saying, 'I am of Paul,' 'I am of Apollos,' and 'I am of Cephas'
The original church did not last too long, but God would not let the church be lost without any kind of recovery
In every century afterward, the Lord raised up a number of 'Ezras' and 'Nehemiahs' to recover, to reconstitute, the church
The Protestant church came into existence at the time of Martin Luther during the Reformation in the sixteenth century
Today there are mainly three kinds of churches on earth: the Catholic Church, the Protestant church, and the original and recovered church
The Catholic Church believes that Christ is God, that He was born of a virgin, and that He died for the sins of sinners and resurrected
There are even some Catholic scholars who have recognized that the Great Babylon in Revelation 17 refers to the Catholic Church
In Matthew 13 the Lord likened the Roman Catholic Church to a woman who took leaven and put it into fine flour
The cup which the woman has in her hand is golden, but it is full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication
One young person from a Catholic family received the Lord Jesus and then went to his parents to tell them that he had the Lord Jesus in him
His parents responded by saying that they already had Jesus, and they pointed to a picture of the so-called Jesus hanging on the wall
They will be thrown directly into the lake of fire, having no need to pass through the formality of any judgment
They had to grow so that they could be transformed to become gold, silver, and precious stones, the material for God's building
Paul laid the unique foundation of Christ but the believers progress would depend upon how they grew and how they built upon this foundation
He will summon all His genuine believers in any kind of church to His judgment seat to be judged and dealt with by Him
In that judgment He will discern whether they have built with gold, silver, and precious stones or with wood, grass, and stubble
Revelation shows us that the New Jerusalem will be the Paradise of God in the thousand years for the overcomers
Those who produce wood, grass, and stubble will have their work burned at the Lord's coming back, and they will be saved as through fire
Eventually, through the Lord's patience, they will be perfected and transformed also into precious material for God's building
At the end of the thousand years, they will also join and participate in the New Jerusalem in its consummation
We should be constituted as those who pursue Christ at any cost, always forgetting the past and going forward to gain Christ
We can live and magnify Christ by living a crucified life toward ourselves, our flesh, our natural life, and everything other than Christ
