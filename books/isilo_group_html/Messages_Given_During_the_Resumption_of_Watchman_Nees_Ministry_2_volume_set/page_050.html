Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SENSE IN THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Tonight we want to consider how we can follow the inner leading. This way appears to be a simple one. In our experience we all know that the Lord lives in us. The result of our going along with the operation of the Spirit of life is surely peace. Romans 8:6 tells us that to walk according to spirit is life and peace. If you ask me what it is to walk according to spirit, I will tell you that to walk according to spirit is to follow the peace within. If you have peace, you can go on, and if you do not have peace, you should stop. If you truly love the Lord and are willing to cooperate with Him, you have to take care of the peace within. When you feel peaceful inside, you can go on. When you do not feel peaceful inside, you should stop.</P><P>To be a Christian is not a question of mental exercise and analyzing in the mind; it is a question of the peace within and of the sense in our spirit. This is to follow the Lord. If we want to follow the Lord, we have to follow the sense He gives to us in our spirit.</P><P>A co-worker sister once went to a fabric store to buy some fabric. She saw some bargain items in the store. On the one hand, she felt within her that she should not buy the fabric. But on the other hand, she felt that the bargain was too good to miss. She went along with her mind and bought the fabric. When she returned home, she was bothered within and could not fellowship with the Lord, nor read the Bible or pray properly. Later, a brother needed that piece of fabric, and the sister sold it to him and spent the money. Her peace then came back. Hence, we should not analyze with our mind. Only the sense in our spirit is trustworthy.</P><P>Once a child dipped his rice dumpling into salt instead of sugar. His eyes may not have been very discerning, but when he took the dumpling, his feeling within told him that it was salt. We should walk according to the operation of the Lord's life within us. The mind expresses itself in analyzing, reasoning, and studying. A Christian who is in his mind is one who remains in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The sense in our spirit is very sensitive, and we have to walk according to this inner sense. The source of this inner sense is the tree of life. The tree of life is very simple; it does not require us to think or to analyze. Nothing can be more simple than the tree of life.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
