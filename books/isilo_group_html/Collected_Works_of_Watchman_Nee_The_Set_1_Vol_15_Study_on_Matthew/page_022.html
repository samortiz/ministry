The dogs and hogs here, and especially those mentioned in 2 Peter 2:22, are the people mentioned in 2 Peter 2:21. These people are like those who stay at the entrance of the church and have received some spiritual education. They are not saved. Second Peter 2:22 described the sows as "washed." This kind of washing is merely a kind of noble concept. It is not the forgiveness of sin that we have received.</P><P>In the Bible hogs are mentioned frequently in the Old Testament, and dogs are mentioned often in the New Testament. Both hogs and dogs are unclean. Hogs have divided hoofs but do not chew the cud; dogs do not have hoofs, nor do they chew the cud. Therefore, both are unclean. Hogs superficially are better than dogs. The spiritual symbol for a Christian is a sheep. Hogs may signify the so-called church-goers, who seem to have a good outward appearance and possess some superficial knowledge of the truth, whereas dogs are those who have neither the outward nor the inward. Philippians tells us to beware of the dogs (3:2), whereas Revelation says that there are dogs in hell (22:15).</P><P>"That which is holy" belongs to God. How can man have the things that are holy? The things that are holy refer to all spiritual things, all things that are out of God. They may refer to revelations or truths, such as the truth of baptism or the truth of the breaking of bread. The "pearls" are "your pearls," referring to what you have personally received from God. The holy things are the ordinary truths that are of God; the pearls are what you have personally and specifically received and experienced. The last part of verse 6 refers to both the hogs and the dogs, and not to the hogs only.</P><P>Verses 7-12: This section enters into a new situation. Although the teachings on the mountain are all commandments, they also contain God's promises. Although they all are laws of God, they also contain God's grace. Although they all tell us what we should do, they also tell us that God gives us the strength to do it.</P><P>Verses 7-8: "Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened."</P><P>"Ask" concerning your conduct, and it shall be given to you; "seek" the kingdom and the righteousness mentioned in the preceding portion, and you will find them; "knock" on the narrow gate that leads to the constricted way, and it will be opened to you. To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to pray in a specific way, and to knock is to pray in a direct way. Each step is more pressing than the previous one. Verse 7 is the promise, whereas verse 8 is the principle. Verse 7 is for the individual. Verse 8 begins with "for," indicating that verse 8 should come before verse 7.</P><P>There are two practical applications of the promise in verse 7: (1) The power to practice Matthew 5-7 must be obtained by prayer. (2) All prayers of faith will receive an answer.</P><P>Verse 11: "If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him!" Being evil is because of being born in sin. "If you then being evil...." This includes all people, for no one is good.</P><P>Chapters five through seven can be divided into three sections: (1) 5:1-20 deals with our relationship with the old law and the general characteristics of the kingdom of the heavens; (2) 5:21-7:12 deals with the Ten Commandments, the "ten words" (Exo. 34:28, ASV margin); (3) 7:13-27 gives the exhortations.</P><P>Verse 12: "Therefore" shows that this verse is a conclusion of all that was previously spoken in the second section, 5:21-7:12, which is on the ten new commandments. The teachings given on the mountain are full of practicality. Here, the phrase "all that you wish" indicates that verse 12 is a principle. Here we see that everything is positive; this is different from the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament. Here the emphasis is on what one should do. The teachings given on the mountain do not contradict the law and the prophets; rather, the teachings stand on the same line with the law and the prophets.</P><P>Verse 13: What is the difference between the "gate" here and the "door" in John 10:9? The door in John 10:9 is the door of grace, whereas the gate here is the gate of the principles of the kingdom of the heavens. "The narrow gate" is the gate to the kingdom of the heavens. This narrow gate refers to the new law presented in the preceding verses. To "enter in" is a matter of choice, and to walk on "the way" is a matter of practice. To enter in through the narrow gate is to cross the threshold, and to walk on the way is a matter related to our daily life. "Narrow" signifies the strictness of the Lord's commands. "Narrow" is a comparative term. Since the law mentioned above is the "narrow gate," there must be another law, a law that is "wider" or more lenient. From this, we see that the demand of the teachings on the mountain did not exist in the former law.</P><P>There are two gates and two ways. One is according to the inward condition, and the other is according to the outward appearance. Christians may choose to enter either of the two gates and to walk either of the two ways. The choice we have today is nothing else but choosing the principles of our life today. However, no one can walk on the constricted way without first entering in through the narrow gate. If you have not entered in through the gate mentioned in Matthew 5-7, you cannot walk on this way.</P><P>Why is entering in through the narrow gate so important? The Greek word for destruction has two meanings: one is "perdition" or "corruption," and the other is "destruction." Here it is better to render it "corruption" or "destruction." Destruction means complete ruin. Even if perdition is used, it should refer to something temporal and not eternal. It is still a wide gate and a broad way, even if there is only a requirement of an average outward morality.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
