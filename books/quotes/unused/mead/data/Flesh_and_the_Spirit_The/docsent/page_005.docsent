   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We all have to see that Satan as sin is in the flesh and that sin is Satan getting into man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this flesh there is also death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The definition of death is weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we are weak to the uttermost, that is death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Death is weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times we try to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We want to be holy persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when we try to do good, we fail.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some of the young brothers who live in a brothers' house may think that the Lord's intention is for them to learn to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are ready to learn the lesson of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But actually they are ready to lose their patience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul said, "To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not" Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is weakness, and weakness is death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even in spiritual things we discover death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We realize that all the members of the Body should function.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before we come to the church meeting, we may make up our mind to function.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we find out that to will is present; but to do it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we come to the meeting, we sense the weakening.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That weakening is death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Death is working; death is day by day affecting us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Human beings today are not living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, everyone is dying.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, everyone will die.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to realize that every person is a dying person because death is working in everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In particular, death is working in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we lose our temper for one minute, this may deaden us for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot pray, have morning watch, or read the Bible, because we are being deadened by our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sin is another title for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sin goes together with death, and Satan is the one that holds the might of death, the power of death, as mentioned in Hebrews 2:14.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we can see these three things: sin, death, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are all together in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The flesh is the "meeting hall" of sin, death, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They always meet here, and their meeting lasts so long that they would never have a dismissal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many of us spend our time attending the meetings of the church in the church meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Satan also has a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The meeting hall of Satan is our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you like to see Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just come to your flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan is here.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Satan is always in the flesh with sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to see how bad the flesh is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, the flesh is at enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Second, this flesh is not subject to the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is always in rebellion against the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Third, this flesh is unable to be subject to the law of God Rom 8:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It has a nature which cannot possibly be subject to the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, we should not try to do good by our flesh, because our flesh cannot be subject to the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fourth, this flesh can never please God v. 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now we might ask, "What shall we do with this flesh?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to Galatians, we have to crucify our flesh 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But Paul told us in Romans that we first have to realize that there is such a thing as the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even now we have this flesh, which is the transmuted body, polluted and corrupted within.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This flesh is filled up with Satan, sin, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The flesh, Satan, sin, and death are one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not think that we have anything good or that we have any possibility of being good.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must be enlightened to see that our flesh is an ugly thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to condemn it, not try to improve it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some Christians get deceived into thinking that after they are saved, their flesh has been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But God would never recover the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our flesh is a hopeless case.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not have any kind of positive expectation concerning our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to realize that the flesh is sin.</S>
