   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HE IS THE LIGHT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Further on in John 8:12, Jesus told the crowd, "I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You can see that again His words are not doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The emphasis here is the "light" and the "I."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not the practice of His teachings that makes a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, it is a relationship with Christ that qualifies us as one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only by believing into Him will we receive the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only by receiving Him will we not walk in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>HE IS FROM ABOVE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 8:21-22 says, "He said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek Me and will die in your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where I am going, you cannot come.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Jews then said, He is not going to kill Himself, is He, for He says, Where I am going, you cannot come?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Jews were confused again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Where is the place He is going that we cannot go?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They thought that perhaps He was going to commit suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually if that place could be reached by committing suicide, the Jews could still get to it by killing themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How could the Lord go to a place to which they could not go?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 23 says, "And He said to them, You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is because of this that where the Lord was going they could not go.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BELIEVING OR NOT BELIEVING THAT HE IS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, they did not die in their sins because they were murderers and adulterers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 24 is crucial, especially the latter half: "Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The King James Version added the word "he" after "I am."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us quote the words of the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord said, "You will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The question is whether or not you believe that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It means that of the millions of people in humanity, you can pick out one and say, "This is He!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is God!"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We want to examine Jesus of Nazareth to see if He indeed is!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we believe that He is, we will not die in our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many are believing in a distorted Christianity, but we want to believe according to what Christianity really is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first question we must ask is whether or not Jesus of Nazareth is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once again the Jews retorted by asking, "Who are You?" v. 25 . Jesus' answer seemed to say, "This is not the first time that I tell you who I am.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Concerning this matter I have never given in. I told you that I am; I am the One." Time after time He proved to others that He is; He is the Son of God.</S>
