<h1 class="title">Experiencing Christ as Our Life</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:1-4</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In order to experience Christ as our life, we need to see that we have one position, one life, one living, one destiny, and one glory with Christ&mdash;vv. 1-4; cf. 1 Cor. 6:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Our position is that we are in Christ; because we are in Him, we are where He is&mdash;sitting at the right hand of God&mdash;Col. 3:1; John 17:24; Eph. 2:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Son&rsquo;s position is in the Father (John 10:38; 14:10); we are in the Son (1 Cor. 1:30a), so we are in the Father (John 14:20; 1 Thes. 1:1; 2 Thes. 1:1).</li>
		<li>It is when we are in the spirit that we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven practically and experientially:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>There is a transmission taking place from Christ in heaven to us on earth by means of the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit&mdash;Eph. 1:19, 22-23; 2:22.</li>
			<li>The very Christ who is sitting on the throne in heaven (Rom. 8:34) is also now in us (v. 10), that is, in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), where the dwelling place, the habitation, of God is (Eph. 2:22).</li>
			<li>Since today our spirit is the place of God&rsquo;s habitation, it is now the gate of heaven, where Christ is the ladder that joins us to heaven and brings heaven to us&mdash;v. 22; Gen. 28:12-17; John 1:51.</li>
			<li>Whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter through the gate of heaven and touch the throne of grace in heaven through Christ as the heavenly ladder; our spirit is the receiving end of the divine transmission, whereas the throne of God is the transmitting end&mdash;Heb. 4:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The life of God is the life of Christ, and the life of Christ has become our life&mdash;John 5:26; Col. 3:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For Christ to be our life means that He is subjective to us to the uttermost&mdash;John 1:4; 14:6a; 10:10b; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:10, 6, 11.</li>
		<li>It is impossible to separate a person from the life of that person, for a person&rsquo;s life is the person himself; thus, to say that Christ is our life means that Christ has become us and that we have one life and living with Him&mdash;John 14:6a; Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		<li>With Christ as the believers&rsquo; life there are three characteristics, which distinguish it from the natural life:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This life is a crucified life&mdash;Gal. 2:20.</li>
			<li>This life is a resurrected life&mdash;John 11:25.</li>
			<li>This life is a life hidden in God&mdash;Col. 3:3-4; Matt. 6:1-6, 16-18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To seek the things which are above and set our mind on them is to join ourselves to the Lord in His heavenly ministry, His divine enterprise; this is to live Christ, to have a living that is one with Christ&rsquo;s living&mdash;Col. 3:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His heavenly ministry, Christ today is living as the High Priest to intercede for the churches&mdash;Heb. 8:1; 4:14; 7:25; 4:16; Col. 4:2.</li>
		<li>In His heavenly ministry, Christ today is living as the heavenly Minister to supply the saints with the riches of Christ&mdash;Heb. 8:1-2; Eph. 3:8.</li>
		<li>In His heavenly ministry, Christ today is living as the universal Administrator of God&rsquo;s government for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;Rev. 4:1-2, 5; 5:6; 1:11-12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>From the throne in the heavens, the divine transmission brings the things above into the local churches&mdash;Eph. 1:19, 22-23.</li>
			<li>In Revelation 4 and 5 we have a vision of our &ldquo;central government,&rdquo; and in Revelation 1 through 3 we have a vision of the local churches as the &ldquo;embassies&rdquo;; through the seven Spirits what is in the heavenly &ldquo;headquarters&rdquo; is transmitted into the churches as the &ldquo;embassies.&rdquo;</li>
			<li>What takes place in the local churches should be under the direction of the throne of God in heaven; in order for the recovery to be the <em>Lord&rsquo;s</em> recovery, it must be under His direction&mdash;Col. 1:18; 2:19; Rev. 4:2-3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Our destiny is glory; Christ is leading us into glory for us to be manifested with Him in glory&mdash;Heb. 2:10; Col. 3:4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Our life is the Christ who dwells within us, and this life is hidden with Christ in God; the Christ hidden in God is typified by the manna hidden in the golden pot&mdash;vv. 3-4; Exo. 16:32-34; Rev. 2:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ as the hidden manna is in God the Father as the golden pot; the Father is in Christ as the Ark with His two natures, divinity and humanity; and Christ as the indwelling Spirit lives in our regenerated spirit to be the reality of the Holy of Holies&mdash;cf. John 14:16-20; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li>
	<li>When we eat Christ as the hidden manna, we are incorporated into Him for the mutual abode of God and man&mdash;John 15:5, 7; 8:31; 6:57, 63; 14:23.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>That Christ is our life is a strong indication that we are to take Him as life and live by Him, that we are to live Him in our daily life&mdash;Col. 3:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ must be our life in a practical and experiential way; day by day we need to be saved in His life&mdash;v. 4; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 5:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be saved in the divine life from the slavery of sin, the law of sin, is by the release of the law of the consummated Spirit&mdash;8:2.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life from the present age of the world is by the sanctification of the consummated Spirit&mdash;12:2a; 6:19b, 22b.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life from our natural being is by the transformation of the life-giving Spirit&mdash;12:2b.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life from individualism is by being built up in the Body of Christ&mdash;v. 5.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life from self-likeness is by the conformation of the life-imparting Spirit&mdash;8:29.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life from our body of humiliation is by the transfiguration in the virtue of the divine life&mdash;v. 30; Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:11.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life is to reign in the divine life&mdash;5:17.</li>
		<li>To be saved in the divine life will result in the victory over Satan&mdash;16:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The new man is the spontaneous issue of our taking Christ as our life and living Him&mdash;Col. 3:3-4, 10-11.</li>
