<h1 class="title">DENYING THE NATURAL MIND, EMOTION,<br />
AND WILL TO GO ALONG WITH<br />
THE INDWELLING CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:29; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Cor. 3:16-18; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 3:17a; 1 Cor. 2:16</h1>
<p>Romans 8:29 tells us that God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son. This is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart. The Scriptures tell us that originally God had the only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ (John 1:18). The Bible also tells us that after the death and resurrection of Christ, God had many sons, with Christ as the Firstborn among them (20:17; Heb. 2:10; cf. Rom. 8:29). In other words, Christ was originally the only begotten Son of God, but after He died and rose from the dead, He became the Firstborn of many sons.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s work according to His eternal purpose is to produce many sons with His Firstborn as the model. God&rsquo;s firstborn Son is the pattern, and according to this pattern, this model, God has produced many sons. God has accomplished this through our regeneration. When we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, the Holy Spirit entered into our spirit. Because the Spirit is the reality of Christ, when the Spirit came into us, Christ Himself came into us. Now, by virtue of our having been regenerated, Christ is in us. Before Christ came into our spirit, our spirit was dead because of sin (Eph. 2:1, 5). However, Christ is life, and when He entered into us, He enlivened our deadened spirit. Because He as the Spirit has entered into our spirit, He is now our life (Col. 3:4). It is by the Spirit regenerating us with Christ as life that we have been made God&rsquo;s many sons. Not only so, God put His Son into us so that Christ might grow and be formed within us (Gal. 4:19). This fulfills God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and desire that we would be His sons in life, nature, and image.</p>
<p>I have been a believer for thirty-eight years. For the first years of my Christian life I was taught much and heard many messages. Within four and a half years I listened to more than one thousand messages. Not only was I taught much in the meetings, but I also read many Christian books. These messages, teachings, and books stressed mainly negative matters, such as how to overcome sin, pride, hatred, and falsehood. During those first years, I do not recall ever being taught that, on the positive side, God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is that we would be conformed to the image of His Son. The teaching on the negative side never enabled me to overcome the negative matters. The more I tried, the more frustrated I became, and after a period of time, I gave up trying altogether. It was then that the Lord opened my eyes to realize that there is no need for me to try to do anything. I realized that since the Holy Spirit was within me, He would work out my conformation to His glorious image. When I realized this, I forgot about trying to be humble and trying not to be proud.</p>
<p>We should forget about these negative matters. The more we try to deal with them, the more we will be troubled by them. For example, the more we try to be humble, the prouder we will become. God did not ordain us to live in such a way. Rather, He foreordained us to be conformed to the image of Christ. We have to focus on Christ and forget about sin. However, it is very hard for us to do this. As Christians, we constantly remember that we should not sin, that we should be humble, and that we should not do anything wrong. Consequently, it is very hard for us to forget about the negative things. It is God&rsquo;s desire that we be conformed to the image of Christ. Let us therefore forget about doing good or evil. We should tell good and evil, &ldquo;I have nothing to do with you anymore. I only care for Christ. Christ is my aim and my everything. I need to be conformed to the image of Christ. He is now in me as the Spirit. He is also my life. I no longer pay attention to good and evil. I only know to live by Christ who is my life.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING CHRIST</h2>
<p>Our problem is that although Christ is in us, we do not apply Him. When I was a young man in China, I used oil lamps for light. Even after electricity was installed in my house, by force of habit I would often strike a match and light the oil lamp when I returned home at night. Even though I tried to remember that since I had electricity, I no longer needed to use the oil lamp, I would frequently forget. At the time of our regeneration, Christ came into us as an &ldquo;electric lamp.&rdquo; Nevertheless, because we are so accustomed to our &ldquo;oil lamp,&rdquo; that is, our old life, we forget to apply Christ in our daily living. In other words, although we have been regenerated in our spirit, we still remain in the old life and forget to live by Christ. This is an indication that after we have been regenerated, we still need to be transformed.</p>
<p>Transformation is very important. Yet among the children of God today, it is almost entirely neglected. Christians speak very much concerning sanctification and holy living. However, our being transformed is more vital than our being sanctified, for unless we are transformed, we cannot be sanctified. We must be transformed from the old life, form, and shape into another life, form, and shape. The old form is the form of Adam. The new form is the form of Christ. To be regenerated is one thing; to be transformed is another thing. Although we have been regenerated in our spirit, the remainder of our being&mdash;primarily our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;has yet to be transformed. Hence, we are still in the old man.</p>
<p>We are certain that our spirit is regenerated, but are we as confident that our mind, emotion, and will have been transformed? Are all these parts transformed, or do they remain in the old life? We all must admit that there is still a long way for us to go before we are fully transformed in our soul. In Romans 12:2 Paul uses the phrase &ldquo;be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; This verse implies that although we have been regenerated in our spirit, our mind remains old. Our mind is about six thousand years old&mdash;it is the mind of Adam. Hence, our mind, and with it our emotion and will, stands in need of being transformed.</p>
<p>How then can we be transformed? This matter has much to do with our heart. Ephesians 3:17 speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts. Again, we have all been regenerated, but I doubt that Christ has made His home in many of our hearts. Is your heart Christ&rsquo;s home? Does Christ really make His home in your heart? Do you love the Lord so much that you offer your heart to Him to let Him occupy it fully? This is a vital matter. The Lord already dwells in our spirit. The problem is whether or not Christ is making His home in our heart. The spirit and the heart are not the same. The Scriptures tell us that the heart includes all the parts of the soul&mdash;the mind, emotion, and the will (Matt. 9:4; John 16:22, 6; Heb. 4:12)&mdash;plus the conscience (10:22; 1 John 3:20). Although we have been regenerated in our spirit, we have to be transformed in our mind, emotion, and will. This transformation can take place only when Christ occupies our heart as a home. We have to love Christ with our whole heart, offer our heart to Him, and let Him take over our whole heart so that He may dwell in it. We should tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, here is my heart. Come and occupy it fully. Come to make Your home in my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First Corinthians 2:16 says, &ldquo;For who has known the mind of the Lord and will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.&rdquo; That we have the mind of Christ means that our mind has been transformed into the mind of Christ. We have Christ, but we may have Him in our spirit only. Whether or not Christ occupies our mind, emotion, or will is the problem. If we are going to enjoy and experience Christ, we must learn this lesson absolutely. We have to love the Lord with our whole heart, offer our whole heart to Him, and give up our mind, emotion, and will to Him. As those who are regenerated, we have to learn that we cannot go along with our own mind, emotion, and will, for they are old and natural. Rather, we must deny them.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
