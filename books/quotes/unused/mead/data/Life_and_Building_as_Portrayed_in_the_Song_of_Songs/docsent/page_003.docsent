   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE IS DIFFERENT FROM GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because spiritual gifts are mentioned in the Bible, Christians may have the misunderstanding that gifts are something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But gifts are different from life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis 2:9 proves strongly that knowledge is contrary to life, and 1 Corinthians proves that gifts are not life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 1:7 points out that the Corinthian believers were behind in no gift.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The context of this verse reveals that they had all the gifts and all knowledge and utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We would think that surely they must be full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we must read the first four verses of 1 Corinthians 3: "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto fleshy, even as unto babes in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For ye are yet fleshly: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not fleshly, and walk as men?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not fleshly?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul told them that they were not spiritual, but fleshly and babyish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He could not feed them with solid food, but with milk because of their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They had all the gifts, yet they were still babes in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This proves strongly that you may have the gifts, and yet not have much life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many times I have used the illustration of Balaam's donkey in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A Gentile prophet by the name of Balaam had a donkey which suddenly spoke in a human language Num 22:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For a donkey to speak a human language is a real gift of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was not the result of human manufacture, and it was not artificial or superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was a genuine tongue given by divine power; otherwise, how could a donkey speak with the human language?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But did that donkey receive the human life?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It received the gift to function, but not the life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No matter how much it spoke the human language, it was not a human; it was still a donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A donkey is still a donkey, even though it may speak the human language better than I do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am a human being, and it is not; I do not have its gift, but I have the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It has the gift, but not the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To know life, we must clearly discern the difference between life and knowledge and between life and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you still consider gifts as life?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose we have a person who speaks in tongues often and another person who has a powerful healing gift.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you consider these gifts as life?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do, you misunderstand life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Life is different from knowledge, and life is different from gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>LIFE IS DIFFERENT FROM POWER</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must also see that life also differs from power.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Electricity is a kind of power; we even call it electrical power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But there is no life in that power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, we may be powerful and still be short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can see this especially in one person in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Samson was very powerful, yet he was short of life Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can never take him as an example of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He might be an example of power, but he was short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many Christians today also have this misunderstanding they think that if you have power, surely you must have life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But power is power, and life is life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You may be exceedingly powerful and still not have much life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus said in Luke 24:49, "And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be clothed lit. with power from on high."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord told the disciples to wait until they would be clothed with power, which He likened to an article of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all know that an article of clothing does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a policeman were to take off his uniform, he would lose his power, but he would still be living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This power is not related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you were driving a car, and a policeman signaled you to stop, you would stop immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is because he exercises power.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But that power is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must be clear that life is different from knowledge, gifts, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today in Christianity there is a very serious trend.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many Christians give their attention either to knowledge, gifts, or power, but very few give their full attention to life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Can we find any power or gifts in Genesis 2?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can only find knowledge mentioned in a negative way, and there is no mention of gifts or power.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Can we find them in Revelation 21 and 22?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All we see in that Holy City is life, life, life!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is the tree of life and the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only life is for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must come back to the pure Word in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord's recovery brings us back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must tell others that the Bible shows us in Genesis 2 and Revelation 21 and 22 that life is the main emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to the Bible we can clearly see that life is different from knowledge, gifts, and power.</S>
