   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"CHRIST IN YOU"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In my early Christian years I loved the Lord, but I was not taught about Christ being in me.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Instead, I was given considerable instruction in prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I learned the meaning of Nebuchadnezzar's dream in Daniel 2 and of the four beasts in Daniel 7.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With all my studying and instruction, however, I was never taught "this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory" Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Words cannot express what a revelation it was to me when I realized this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ in me!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even today some Christians oppose this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During my recent visit to Taipei, I was preaching from Romans that we are vessels having God Himself as our content 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I later heard that a traveling evangelist who was listening protested, asking how such a big God could possibly fit into such a small container as man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How pitiful that a preacher could be so ignorant!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Does the Bible from which he preaches not say that Christ is in us?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is the Lord Jesus not bigger than we?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible clearly states that this big Christ is contained in us small human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, we cannot explain how this could be.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even in the natural realm there are many things for which we have no explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know the facts, but not the whys.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can utilize electricity, for example, but why it works as it does we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How the great God can fit into His small creature is a puzzle, but we know that this is the case because the Bible tells us so.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have spent many years mining the Bible to dig out its riches, seeking to find the answers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A young, married sister once interrupted my speaking in a meeting to ask how we could abide in the Lord and the Lord abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I told her to hold her question, that I would come to it later.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I then continued my speaking on this matter of Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word spirit in Greek, I said, is the same as the word for air.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To say that the Lord is the Spirit of life is to say that He is the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I then addressed myself to her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Sister, you are now abiding in the air, and the air is abiding in you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Otherwise, you would not be alive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because the Lord Jesus is the breath of life, we are in Him just as we are in the fresh air.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The air that is in us is like the Lord Himself in us."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus can be in us because in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Were He not the Spirit, He could not abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Now the Lord is the Spirit" 2 Cor 3:17 !</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE SPIRIT IN REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are some mysterious verses in Revelation about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1:4 John greets the seven churches which are in Asia: "Grace to you and peace from Him Who is, and Who was, and Who is coming, and from the seven Spirits Who are before His throne."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Who or what are these seven Spirits?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are the seven eyes of the Lamb 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These seven Spirits are surely the one Spirit, the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How then can there be seven?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the book of Revelation was written, the churches were degraded and in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With the churches in such a low condition, the Spirit needed to be intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The lampstand in the tabernacle had seven lamps Exo 25:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The amount of light we need from a lamp depends on how dark it is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may have a lamp at home with a three-way bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are reading, we may turn it on all the way so as to get the most light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the other hand, if it is early evening, we may get enough light turning it only once.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Revelation the churches were too weak and too dark; the light was not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It needed to be intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This intensified light is the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The traditional view of the Trinity breaks down when confronted with seven Spirits and the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the Godhead is categorized into three separate and distinct Persons, what can we do with this description of the Spirit of God in Revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ, the second Person, is the Lamb, but His seven eyes are the seven Spirits, the third Person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Holy Spirit here is the eyes of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Can we think of a person's eyes as other than himself?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are hit in the eye, have we ourselves not been hit?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Are we one person and our eyes another?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Theology's explanation of the Trinity comes from mental exercise; it cannot stand the test of practical experience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In our experience the Holy Spirit is indeed the eyes of Christ.</S>
