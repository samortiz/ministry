to Be Manifested, the Apostles, Elders, and Saints<br />
All Needing to Be Spiritual</h2>
<p>The apostles who appoint elders must be spiritual, and those who are appointed to be elders must also be spiritual. Moreover, the saints who receive the elders&rsquo; authority must be spiritual too. All three must be spiritual. Authority in the church is not a matter of autocracy or democracy but theocracy. The problem in many churches is that those who appoint the elders, the appointed ones, and those who receive the appointed elders are not spiritual. Nevertheless, all say that they do things according to biblical principles. May we all be clear that biblical principles are not a guarantee of being spiritual. Only the authority of the Holy Spirit can safeguard us and cause us to be genuinely spiritual.</p>
<p>Biblical principles can be living only if they are applied in the Holy Spirit; otherwise, they are merely dead letters. If an apostle is going to appoint an elder, he must ask himself whether or not he is in the Holy Spirit. Likewise, if a brother is about to be appointed as an elder, he needs to ask himself whether or not he is in the Holy Spirit. Moreover, when a saint receives someone as an elder, an authority, the saint should ask himself whether or not he is in the Holy Spirit. If those who appoint elders, those who are appointed elders, and those who receive the elders are all in the Holy Spirit, others will see God&rsquo;s authority, God&rsquo;s government, in the church, and there will be a free way for the authority of the Head to be realized in the church.</p>
<p>Psalm 133:2-3 says, &ldquo;It is like the fine oil upon the head / That ran down upon the beard, / Upon Aaron&rsquo;s beard, / That ran down upon the hem of his garments; / Like the dew of Hermon / That came down upon the mountains of Zion. / For there Jehovah commanded the blessing: / Life forever.&rdquo; In this psalm we see the dew, the oil, and Jehovah&rsquo;s commanded blessing, which is, life forever. This is the condition of Mount Zion, the condition of the mysterious Body of Christ. In other words, under this kind of condition, the glory and beauty of the church are fully expressed.</p>
<p>Sometimes in our fallen mind, questions may arise, &ldquo;Is the church being controlled by someone? Are we being controlled?&rdquo; When such questions arise within us, we should not consider the ones who appoint elders or the ones who are appointed elders; rather, we should consider ourselves and ask, &ldquo;Where am I? Am I in the Holy Spirit or in the flesh?&rdquo; If we are living in the Holy Spirit, no one can deceive or control us, and we will certainly know the condition of the ones who appoint elders. At the same time, we will also know the condition of the ones who have been appointed elders. Our safeguard does not lie in biblical principles but in the authority of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>If those who appoint elders, those who are appointed elders, and those who receive the elders all live according to the self, the church will be under the control of men. Although those in the church may say, &ldquo;We are walking according to biblical principles,&rdquo; they have no life and have lost the safeguard of the Holy Spirit. To live in submission to the authority of the Holy Spirit is to obey the Spirit, not to walk merely according to the Bible. The administration of the church is safeguarded when everyone submits to the Spirit. When everyone submits to the Spirit, no one can pretend, nor can anyone deceive or control others. A person who submits to authority does not want to rule over others. The more spiritual authority a person has, the less he desires to rule over others. This is a wonderful matter. In contrast, all those who desire to rule over others do not submit to God&rsquo;s authority and do not have God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>A person who does not submit to God&rsquo;s authority cannot deceive those who do. If we live under the authority of the Holy Spirit, we will know whether a person is living in submission to God&rsquo;s authority. We will know whether he is a Saul or a David, and we will not be deceived or controlled by him. If you say that someone has deceived you or exercised control over you, this indicates that both are living in the same place&mdash;the flesh. Living in the flesh is contagious. However, if an elder is the flesh and you are a living stone, the contagious infection will not affect you.</p>
<p>If we stay in the Spirit, we should not be worried about anything, because the Holy Spirit is our safeguard. A person who lives in the flesh and according to his own will is a Saul. This will be very clear in the spirit of the saints. The Holy Spirit will speak, make known, and impart some feeling into the saints. The administration of the church is altogether a matter of God&rsquo;s government, of the authority of the Head, and of life. If we stay in the Spirit, the church surely will be spiritual and strong.</p>
<p>Similarly, the appointment of deacons is also a matter of authority. A person does not become a deacon simply because he desires to be one or because a group of brothers has nominated him. This requires the appointing by the apostles and is altogether a matter of the authority of the Head.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 3, The Organization of the Church &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
