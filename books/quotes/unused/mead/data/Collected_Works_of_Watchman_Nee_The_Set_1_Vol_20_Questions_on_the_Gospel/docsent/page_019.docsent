   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION FIFTEEN CONCERNING THE LAW AND FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How do we "establish the law" through faith Rom 3:31 ?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why are the believers "not under the law" Rom 6:14 ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What does it mean to be "not under the law"?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why is Christ the "end of the law" Rom 10:4 ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 3:31 says, "Do we then make the law of no effect through faith?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, we establish the law."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is Paul's conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Prior to this he said, "For we account that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law" v. 28 . Since this is the case, someone may have raised the question: "Is not the law made void by faith?" Therefore, Paul answered, "Absolutely not!" The phrase "Absolutely not!" is a Greek idiom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is the same as "Heaven forbid!" in Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul meant that heaven would not agree with you saying that the law was abolished by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the first three chapters of Romans, Paul shows that the Gentiles, whom God had not chosen, were sinners, and the Jews, whom God had chosen, were also sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who served God and had the law of God were also sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No one can be justified by keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, Paul says, "Because out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him; for through the law is the clear knowledge of sin" 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested, witness being borne to it by the Law and the Prophets" 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praise and thank God for "but now."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now there is a way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus" 3:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God exercised forbearance toward those in the Old Testament, and He justifies those in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Old Testament age the Lord had not died, and sin had not been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, God forbore man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But today God justifies rather than forbears.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To justify is not only to forgive a man or reckon him to be without sins but, even more, to pronounce him righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God gives us this righteousness in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can now receive this righteousness because Christ died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, Paul said, "For we account that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law" 3:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul was afraid someone might think that since man was justified through faith, the law would be abolished through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why he immediately said, "Absolutely not!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>3:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even heaven forbids man to say that.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How, then, do we establish the law through faith?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The law has only two requirements: 1 the law commands man to do good, and 2 the law punishes those who do not do good.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The law requires one of these two.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you do not keep the law, you will be punished by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you do not follow the law and establish it, you will be punished by the law in order to establish it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Besides the Lord, no other person can keep the law; even Moses the lawgiver did not keep the law completely.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The law requires death for those who do not keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can say, "I did not keep the law; I have sinned; I have died already.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Christ, I have received the judgment of the law and the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, I did not break the law; rather, I established it through faith."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although we cannot establish the law by keeping it and deserve to die, praise and thank God that we have died in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is of God that we are in Christ Jesus 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is God who put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Christ died, we also died in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, faith does not make the law void; rather, it establishes the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why are the believers not under the law?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The believers are not under the law because, on the one hand, they are already dead, and on the other hand, they are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can prove this by Romans 7:1-6.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul uses a parable of a woman and her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to note what "the husband" refers to in this section.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some say "the husband" refers to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Others say "the husband" refers to our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Each group has its own opinions and reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, if we read it carefully, we will see that both implications are actually here.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Romans 7:2, the husband is the law, yet the husband is different from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, "the husband" in this section has two meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One meaning refers to the law, and the other meaning refers to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the husband referred only to the law, then the phrase "if the husband dies" would mean that law is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But how can the law die?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once we are clear about this point, we can conclude that "the husband" in this section refers to the flesh and also to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Prior to believing in the Lord, everyone is bound by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How can one break away from it?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It can only be done through death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once we are dead, we break away.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God condemned sin in Christ's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have died in Christ and broken away from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are like the woman, and our flesh is like the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once we are dead, we break away from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The requirement of the law, at most, is death.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>No matter how many sins a sinner has committed, the law can, at most, sentence him to die once.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Once he is dead, everything is ended.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once we die, we break away from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the other hand, the verse says, "If the husband dies, she is discharged from the law regarding the husband" 7:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This refers to severing our relationship with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Severing our relationship with the law is likened to death.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The first part of the sentence emphasizes death; the second part emphasizes severing.</S>
