<h1 class="title">The Focal Point of the Divine Revelation<br />
in the Book of Galatians</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19; 3:26-28; 6:15</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The most crucial and mysterious matter revealed in the Bible is that God&rsquo;s ultimate intention is to work Himself in Christ into His chosen people&mdash;Eph. 3:17a; 4:4-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s desire to work Himself into our being is the focal point of the divine revelation in the Scriptures&mdash;Rom. 8:9-10, 6, 11.</li>
	<li>The book of Galatians reveals that God&rsquo;s intention is for Christ to be wrought into His chosen people that they may become sons of God for His corporate expression&mdash;1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19; 3:26; 6:10, 16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Galatians presents a comparison of God&rsquo;s two economies&mdash;His Old Testament economy and His New Testament economy&mdash;3:22-29:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word for God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy is <em>law,</em> and the word for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is <em>Christ</em>&mdash;v. 24.</li>
	<li>Paul experienced a genuine conversion, a real turn from God&rsquo;s old economy of law to His new economy of Christ&mdash;1:13-16.</li>
	<li>Christ, the Spirit, the new creation, and our spirit are the four basic things covered in this book as the underlying thought of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;2:20; 3:2; 6:15, 18.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to dispense Himself as the processed and consummated Triune God into our being to be our life and our everything to make Himself one with us and us one with Him so that we may express Him in a corporate way for eternity&mdash;Rom. 8:10, 6, 11; 12:4-5; Rev. 21:2, 9-10.</li>
	<li>It is not God&rsquo;s intention to have a group of good people; God wants many sons who are one with Him organically and who possess His life and nature and who thus can be members of the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 8:14; 12:4-5.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is the dispensing of Himself into His chosen and redeemed people to make them His sons; therefore, sonship is the focal point of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Gal. 4:4-6.</li>
	<li>As we read the book of Galatians, we need to see that God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to put us into Christ and to impart Himself as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit into us to produce an organic union&mdash;an organic oneness in life&mdash;between us and the Triune God so that we may become His corporate expression&mdash;3:27-28; 4:19; 6:10, 16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Galatians reveals that Christ is versus religion with its law&mdash;2:16, 20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Galatians deals with the law given by Moses and with the religion formed according to this law&mdash;4:21; 1:13-14.</li>
	<li>The law, the base of Judaism, has been terminated and replaced by Christ&mdash;Rom. 10:4; Gal. 2:16.</li>
	<li>The book of Galatians deals strongly with deviation from Christ by going back to the law&mdash;5:1-2, 4.</li>
	<li>The desire of God&rsquo;s heart cannot be satisfied by our efforts to keep the law; His desire can be satisfied only if we remain with Christ and live Him out&mdash;Phil. 1:21a.</li>
	<li>To hold to the law after Christ has come is against the basic principle of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Gal. 4:21; 5:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is rebellion against God&rsquo;s economy to snatch people from Christ and to bring them back to the law.</li>
		<li>Since Christ has come, the function of the law has been terminated; therefore, Christ must replace the law in our life for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;3:23-25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The three main negative things dealt with in Galatians are the law, the flesh, and religion; these three go together, for when we are under the law, we are involved with both the flesh and religion&mdash;2:16; 3:3; 1:13-14; 6:14.</li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s burden in Galatians was to reveal Christ in such a way that He would be not only the focal point of God&rsquo;s economy but also the focal point of our daily walk&mdash;1:15-16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is not with man in the old creation but with man in the new creation through the resurrection of Christ&mdash;6:14-15; 1:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The main issue in Galatians is not circumcision or uncircumcision, religion or no religion; it is an issue of whether or not we are a new creation through an organic union with the Triune God&mdash;6:15.</li>
	<li>Apparently Paul wrote the book of Galatians to deal with the law; actually this book deals with the old creation.</li>
	<li>The new creation is altogether different from any kind of religion; religion is part of the old creation, and everything practiced in the religious world is part of the old creation&mdash;v. 14.</li>
	<li>Galatians brings us to the new creation by way of the inward revelation of the living person of the Son of God&mdash;v. 15; 1:15-16.</li>
	<li>The new creation is the mingling of God with man&mdash;John 15:4; 1 John 4:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The meaning of the new creation is that the processed and consummated Triune God mingles Himself with us and constitutes us with Himself to make us new&mdash;Eph. 4:4-6, 24; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		<li>Although we remain God&rsquo;s creatures, we are nonetheless mingled with the Creator.</li>
		<li>Because we are now one with the Creator, His life becomes our life, and our living becomes His living; this mingling produces a new creation&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we would be in the new creation, we must enter into an organic union with the Triune God; apart from this union we remain in the old creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
	<li>The new creation is the new man in Christ (Eph. 4:24), our being that is regenerated by the Spirit (John 3:6), having God&rsquo;s life and the divine nature wrought into it (v. 36; 2 Pet. 1:4), with Christ as its constituent (Col. 3:10-11); it is this new creation that fulfills God&rsquo;s eternal purpose by expressing God in His sonship.</li>

<h1 class="title">Being Rescued out of the Present Evil Age<br />
by the Revelation of God&rsquo;s Son in Us</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:3-4, 11-16</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The subject of the book of Galatians is the rescue of the distracted believers out of the evil religious age&mdash;1:3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>An age refers to a section, an aspect, the present or modern appearance, of the world as the satanic system, which is used by Satan to usurp and occupy God&rsquo;s people to keep them away from God and His purpose&mdash;Eph. 2:2; 1 John 2:14-15.</li>
	<li>According to the context of this book, the present evil age here refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, the Jewish religion, which became formal in letter, deadening in quenching the Spirit, killing in man&rsquo;s communication with God in life, and contending with the gospel of Christ in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Gal. 6:14-15; 1:6-16; 2 Cor. 3:6; Phil. 3:2-3.</li>
	<li>The purpose of Christ&rsquo;s giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us, out of the Jewish religion, the present evil age; this is to release God&rsquo;s chosen people from the custody of the law (Gal. 3:23), to bring them out of the sheepfold (John 10:1, 3, 16), according to the will of God (cf. 1 Tim. 1:3-4):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>According to the revelation of the typology in the Song of Songs, Christ leads His loving seeker into her spirit, and in her spirit in fellowship with Him, she receives the revelation of how to leave the place where she is kept away from the church to go forth on the footsteps of the flock&mdash;1:4b-8.</li>
		<li>The flock is the church as the place where Christ pastures, shepherds and feeds, His saints&mdash;John 10:16; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s seeker was seeking after the Lord for her own satisfaction, but the Lord&rsquo;s concern for His saved sinners is not just for their satisfaction but for God&rsquo;s eternal economy; God&rsquo;s economy is to save sinners to gain the churches so that the essence of these churches can become the organic Body of Christ as the precursor for the consummation of the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rom. 5:10; Rev. 1:11-12; Eph. 1:22-23; Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We must overcome the present evil age of today&rsquo;s degraded Christendom with its Judaistic system by holding to the teaching of the apostles (the New Testament) through the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit&mdash;Acts 2:42; 1 Tim. 1:3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Judaism has earthly promises with earthly blessings, but in the new testament we have the all-inclusive Spirit as the totality of the unsearchable riches of Christ to be our unique blessing for us to bless others to issue in the fullness of God&mdash;Gen. 12:2-3; Gal. 3:14; Eph. 3:8; 1:3; Luke 12:21; Rev. 2:9; 2 Cor. 6:10; Eph. 3:19b.</li>
		<li>Judaism has the law of letters, but in the new testament we have the law of the Spirit of life&mdash;Rom. 8:2; Heb. 8:10; Rom. 2:28-29; 5:20.</li>
		<li>Judaism has mediatorial priests, but in the new testament all the believers are priests to be a holy and royal priesthood&mdash;Rev. 1:5b-6; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; cf. Rev. 2:6.</li>
		<li>Judaism has a material temple, but in the new testament the temple is a spiritual house, a dwelling place of God in spirit&mdash;Eph. 2:21-22:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In Judaism the worshippers and the place of worship are two different things, but in the new testament the place of worship is the worshipper&mdash;John 4:24; Acts 2:46; 5:42.</li>
			<li>The Father&rsquo;s house, typified by the temple, is a divine and human incorporation of the processed and consummated God constituted with His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed elect&mdash;John 14:2, 20, 23; 1 Tim. 3:15; Rev. 21:3, 22.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s Son is versus man&rsquo;s religion&mdash;Gal. 1:11-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The desire of God&rsquo;s heart is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life (John 17:3; 3:16), and become the sons of God (1:12; Gal. 4:5-6).</li>
	<li>The focal point of the Bible is not practices, doctrines, or ordinances&mdash;it is the living person of the Son of God, who is the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit for us to enjoy Him, partake of His riches, and live Him&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; Phil. 1:19; Gal. 6:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the eyes of God, there is no place for religion or tradition&mdash;only the living person of His Son has a place; God cares only for this living person, not for anything else&mdash;Col. 1:18b; 2:16-17; 3:10b-11; Mark 9:7-8.</li>
		<li>Without this living person as the reality and content of the church life, even the church life will become a tradition; the church is the Body of this person, His fullness, His practical and living expression&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 3:8-11, 16-19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Nothing is more pleasing to God than the unveiling, the revelation, of the living person of the Son of God in us&mdash;Gal. 1:15a, 16a; 2 Cor. 3:14-17; 4:3-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The more inward, subjective revelation we receive of the Son of God, the more He will live in us; the more He lives in us, the more He will become to us the reality of the all-inclusive land as the blessing of Abraham, the blessing of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit&mdash;Gal. 2:20; 3:14.</li>
	<li>If we drop our concepts, turn our heart to the Lord, pay attention to the spirit, and spend time in the Word in a spirit and atmosphere of prayer, Christ will be revealed in us, live in us, and be formed in us&mdash;1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must drop our concepts; every concept, whether spiritual or carnal, is a veil; this inward revelation is in our spirit through our enlightened mind&mdash;2 Cor. 3:14-15; 4:4; Eph. 1:17-18; Luke 24:45.</li>
		<li>We must turn our heart to the Lord; the more we turn our heart to the Lord, the less ground the god of this age will have in our life and in our being, and we will be under the shining of the heavenly light to receive the inward revelation of this living person&mdash;2 Cor. 3:16, 18.</li>
		<li>We must care for and pay attention to our spirit; it is in our spirit that the Spirit is shining, revealing Christ in us, and speaking to us concerning Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:17; 3:5; cf. Rev. 1:10; 2:7.</li>
		<li>We must pray-read the Word&mdash;Eph. 6:17-18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to be full of the revelation of the Son of God and thereby become a new creation with Christ living in us, being formed in us, and being enjoyed by us continually as the all-inclusive Spirit&mdash;Gal. 6:14-15.</li>

<li>Galatians reveals that God&rsquo;s plan according His good pleasure is to work Christ Himself into us; the most evil thing, according to Galatians, is to distract people from Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:5; Gal. 1:4-16; 2:20; 4:19; <em>Hymns,</em> #538.</li>
<li>Galatians presents the Christ who is the threefold seed in humanity for God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself into the believers of Christ for the fulfillment of His economy&mdash;3:16; Gen. 3:15; Gal. 4:4; Luke 8:5a, 11; John 12:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ as the seed of the woman refers to the incarnated Christ, the complete God becoming a perfect man through the dispensing of Himself into humanity in order to destroy Satan and to save the believers in Christ from sin and death&mdash;Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:16, 20-21, 23; Gal. 4:4; John 1:1, 14; Heb. 2:14; 1 Cor. 15:53-57.</li>
	<li>Christ as the seed of Abraham is for the blessing to all the families of the earth; the unique seed of Abraham as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, who is the blessing of Abraham (the reality of the good land), for the dispensing of Himself into the believers of Christ to make them the corporate seed of Abraham&mdash;Gen. 12:2-3, 7; 17:7-8; Gal. 3:14, 16, 29; John 14:17-20; 1 Cor. 15:45b; John 12:24; Isa. 53:10.</li>
	<li>Christ as the seed of David refers to the resurrected Christ, who carries out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy for the dispensing of the processed Triune God into the members of His Body, so that they may share His kingship in His resurrection in the eternal kingdom&mdash;2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Matt. 22:42-45; Rom. 1:3; Rev. 22:16; Acts 2:30-31; Matt. 16:16-18; Rev. 20:4, 6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The great mountain, the kingdom of God that fills the whole earth in Daniel 2:34-35, is the corporate threefold seed in humanity, which includes all the believers in Christ&mdash;cf. Mark 4:26.</li>
		<li>Through Christ as the threefold seed in humanity, the enemies are gone, the blessing is here, and we are in the kingdom; this is the revelation of the entire Bible.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Galatians reveals the way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit&mdash;the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God&mdash;3:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by God&rsquo;s revealing of Christ in us; we live the Christian life according to the Christ whom we have seen&mdash;1:16a; Eph. 1:17; Gen. 13:14-18; Eph. 3:8, 19.</li>
	<li>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by our receiving of Christ out of the hearing of faith&mdash;Gal. 3:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The faith of the believers is Christ entering into them to be their faith, making their spirit a spirit of faith&mdash;Heb. 12:2a; Gal. 2:16; Rom. 3:22; 2 Cor. 4:13.</li>
		<li>Faith comes out of the hearing of the word&mdash;Rom. 10:17.</li>
		<li>Faith is to believe that God is and we are not; faith always annuls us and reveals Christ to us&mdash;Heb. 11:6; Gen. 5:24; John 8:58; Gal. 2:20.</li>
		<li>The believers are the members of the family, the household, of faith; this faith-house is a house that believes in God through His word&mdash;6:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by being born according to the Spirit and by being given the Spirit of God&rsquo;s Son into our hearts&mdash;4:29b, 6.</li>
	<li>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by putting on Christ through the baptism that puts us into Christ&mdash;3:27.</li>
	<li>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by being identified with Him in His death so that it may be no longer we who live but He who lives in us; and the life which we now live in the flesh we live by the faith of Christ&mdash;2:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be identified with Christ means to be one spirit with Him and even to be one entity with Him&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17; Phil. 1:20-21a.</li>
		<li>We are identified with Christ in His death in order that it may be no longer we who live but Christ who lives in us&mdash;Rom. 6:3-4; Gal. 2:20a.</li>
		<li>We live such a life in Christ as our faith; genuine faith is Christ Himself infused into us to become our appreciation of Him as a reaction to His attraction&mdash;v. 20b; 2 Cor. 5:14-15; Heb. 12:2a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by living and walking by the Spirit&mdash;Gal. 5:16, 25.</li>
	<li>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by having Christ formed in us through travail&mdash;4:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s being formed in us depends on our being transformed; our being transformed and His being formed in us cause us to be conformed to His image&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29.</li>
		<li>To have Christ formed in us is to have the three parts of our soul (our mind, emotion, and will) renewed&mdash;12:2; 2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by sowing unto the Spirit with the desire and aim of the Spirit in view, to accomplish what the Spirit desires&mdash;Gal. 6:7-8.</li>
	<li>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by boasting in the cross of Christ and living a new creation&mdash;vv. 14-15.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The purpose of the book of Galatians is to cause its recipients to know that the gospel preached by the apostle Paul was not from man&rsquo;s teaching but from God&rsquo;s revelation&mdash;1:11-12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul desired to rescue the churches in Galatia, which had been distracted by Judaism with its law, and to bring them back to the grace of the gospel&mdash;vv. 6-12; 5:4.</li>
	<li>The law dealt with man in the old creation, whereas the gospel makes man a new creation in resurrection&mdash;1:1, 6-12; 2:20; 6:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The gospel is the fulfillment of the entire Old Testament&mdash;Mark 1:1, 14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The gospel is the fulfillment of the promises, prophecies, and types and is also the removal of the law; this is a full definition of the gospel&mdash;Gen. 3:15, 21.</li>
	<li>The gospel preached to Abraham was the unveiling of God&rsquo;s heart; the promise God gave to Abraham was the gospel&mdash;12:3; 22:17-18; Gal. 3:6-14.</li>
	<li>Christ, the unique One, is the fulfillment of the entire Old Testament; this means that the fulfillment of the promises, prophecies, and types and the removal of the law are a living person, Jesus Christ&mdash;Matt. 17:2-8; Rom. 10:4.</li>
	<li>The gospel is the fulfillment of the great promise concerning the seed of the woman for the destruction of the serpent and of the great promise concerning the seed of Abraham for bringing in the blessing of the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God as eternal life to be our blessing&mdash;Gen. 3:15; 22:17-18; Heb. 2:14; John 3:14; Gal. 3:14.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Galatians affords us a complete revelation of the truth, the reality, of the gospel, not in detail but in certain basic principles&mdash;2:5, 14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first aspect of the truth of the gospel is that fallen man cannot be justified out of works of law&mdash;v. 16a.</li>
	<li>Under God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, we are not to keep the law; rather, we are justified out of faith in Christ&mdash;v. 16b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Through believing we are joined to Christ and become one with Him&mdash;John 3:15.</li>
		<li>Faith in Christ denotes an organic union with Him through believing; the term <em>in Christ</em> refers to this organic union&mdash;Gal. 2:17; 3:14, 28; 5:6.</li>
		<li>Justification is not merely a matter of position; it is also an organic matter, a matter in life.</li>
		<li>It is by means of our organic union with Christ that God can reckon Christ as our righteousness; only in this way can we be justified by God&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, we have life and live by faith&mdash;Gal. 3:11.</li>
	<li>We are dead to the law, we are alive to God, and we have Christ living in us&mdash;2:19-20.</li>
	<li>In Christ we are a new creation&mdash;6:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul&rsquo;s gospel is the unique gospel, the complete gospel&mdash;1:7; Col. 1:25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s gospel includes all the aspects of the gospel in the four Gospels:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Matthew the goal of the gospel of the kingdom is to bring people into God to make them citizens of the kingdom of the heavens&mdash;28:19; 24:14; Rom. 14:17; Gal. 5:21.</li>
		<li>In Mark the preaching of the gospel is to bring part of the old creation into the new creation&mdash;16:15-16; Rom. 8:20-21; Gal. 6:15.</li>
		<li>In Luke we have the gospel of forgiveness to bring redeemed people back to the God-ordained blessing&mdash;24:46-48; 1:77-79; 2:30-32; Eph. 1:3, 7; Gal. 3:14.</li>
		<li>In John we have the eternal life that we may bear fruit for the building up of the Body of Christ, which is Christ&rsquo;s increase&mdash;20:31; 15:16; Rom. 8:10, 6, 11; 12:4-5; Gal. 3:28; 4:19; 6:10, 16.</li>

		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul&rsquo;s gospel is a revelation of the Triune God processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; Gal. 3:2, 5, 14.</li>
		<li>Paul&rsquo;s gospel is centered on the Triune God being our life in order to be one with us and to make us one with Him, that we may be the Body of Christ to express Christ in a corporate way&mdash;Rom. 8:11; 12:4-5; Eph. 1:22-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ, a living person, is the focus of Paul&rsquo;s gospel; hence, the book of Galatians is emphatically Christ-centered&mdash;1:15-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ was crucified to redeem us out of the curse of the law and rescue us out of the evil religious course of the world&mdash;3:1, 13; 1:4, 15-16.</li>
	<li>Christ was resurrected from the dead that He might live in us&mdash;v. 1; 2:20.</li>
	<li>We were baptized into Christ, being identified with Him, and we have put on Christ, clothing ourselves with Him; thus, we are in Christ and have become of Him&mdash;3:27-29; 5:24.</li>
	<li>Christ has been revealed in us, He is now living in us, and He will be formed in us&mdash;1:16; 2:20; 4:19.</li>
	<li>To Christ the law has conducted us, and in Christ we are all sons of God&mdash;3:24, 26.</li>
	<li>In Christ we inherit God&rsquo;s promised blessing and enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit&mdash;v. 14.</li>
	<li>In Christ we all are one&mdash;v. 28.</li>
	<li>We should not be deprived of all profit from Christ and thus be separated, severed, from Him&mdash;5:4.</li>
	<li>We need Christ to supply us with grace in our spirit that we may live Him&mdash;6:18.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s desire is that His chosen people receive His Son into them; this is the gospel&mdash;1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The focal point of Paul&rsquo;s gospel is God Himself in His Trinity becoming the processed all-inclusive Spirit to be life and everything to us for our enjoyment so that He and we may be one to express Him for eternity&mdash;vv. 4, 6; 3:13-14, 26-28; 6:15.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 2:19-20; 1 Cor. 6:17; John 14:19; 15:4</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Paul wrote the book of Galatians both according to truth and according to experience&mdash;2:5, 14; 4:16; 5:7; 1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19.</li>
<li>The Christian life is a life of organic oneness with Christ&mdash;John 15:4; Gal. 2:19-20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God desires that the divine life and the human life be joined to become one life; this oneness is a union in life&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>The Christian life is not an exchanged life&mdash;the exchange of a lower life for a higher one&mdash;but a grafted life&mdash;the grafting of the human life into the divine life and the mingling of the human life with the divine life&mdash;Rom. 11:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In grafting, two similar lives are joined and then grow together organically; in the process of spiritual grafting, two lives&mdash;the divine life and the human life&mdash;are grafted and become one&mdash;Gen. 1:26; 2:7.</li>
		<li>In order for us to be grafted into Christ, He had to pass through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit&mdash;John 1:14; Matt. 1:1; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
		<li>When the preciousness of the Lord Jesus was infused into us and we began to appreciate Him, we were grafted into Him; we were joined to Christ in His resurrection and were organically united with Him&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By believing into Christ and being baptized into Him, we have been grafted into Him&mdash;John 3:15; Gal. 3:27.</li>
			<li>We have been grafted into the One who is the seed to fulfill God&rsquo;s promise and also the life-giving Spirit as the blessing of the good land&mdash;vv. 16, 14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>As regenerated ones, we should live a grafted life&mdash;John 15:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>After we have been grafted into Christ, we should no longer live by ourselves; rather, we should allow the pneumatic Christ to live in us&mdash;Gal. 2:20.</li>
			<li>We should no longer live by our flesh or by our natural being; instead, we should live by our regenerated spirit, a spirit grafted with Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the grafted life, the divine life works to discharge the negative elements and to resurrect our God-created being&mdash;1 Thes. 5:23; Rom. 8:10, 6, 11.</li>
		<li>Through this grafting, we are united, mingled, and incorporated with Christ to become in Him an enlarged, universal, divine and human incorporation&mdash;the Body of Christ, which consummates the New Jerusalem&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; John 15:4; 14:20; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the organic union with Christ, we have the experience of being dead to the law and alive to God&mdash;Gal. 2:19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be dead to the law means to be discharged from the law in which we were held; to live to God means to be obligated to God in the divine life&mdash;Rom. 7:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Christ&rsquo;s death our obligation under the law has been terminated&mdash;v. 4a.</li>
		<li>In Christ&rsquo;s resurrection we are responsible to God in the resurrection life&mdash;v. 4b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we are not actually organically united with Christ but are in ourselves, then we are neither dead to the law nor alive to God&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 2:16-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be dead to the law and alive to God implies the death and resurrection of Christ&mdash;Rom. 6:3-5; Col. 2:12.</li>
		<li>Only by being grafted into Christ to have an organic union with Him can we be one with Him in His death and resurrection.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the organic union with Christ, His history becomes our history&mdash;Gal. 2:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>One aspect of our history includes the crucifixion by which we have been cut off from everything other than God&mdash;6:14.</li>
		<li>Another aspect of our history includes the resurrection in which we have been united with the Triune God&mdash;Rom. 6:5; Matt. 28:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we are cut off from the law by means of the organic union with Christ, we spontaneously live to God&mdash;Gal. 2:19.</li>
	<li>Because we and Christ are one, whatever belongs to Him is ours; through our organic union with Him, we share whatever He is and has&mdash;Eph. 3:8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Galatians 2:20 we see the most basic truth of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;no longer I but Christ living in me:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to God&rsquo;s economy, we should no longer live; rather, Christ should live in us:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s economy is that &ldquo;I&rdquo; be crucified with Christ and that Christ live in me in His resurrection.</li>
		<li>In His economy God&rsquo;s intention is for the processed Triune God to be wrought into our being to make us a new person, a new &ldquo;I.&rdquo;</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As regenerated people we have both an old &ldquo;I&rdquo; and a new &ldquo;I&rdquo;; the old &ldquo;I&rdquo; has been terminated, but the new &ldquo;I&rdquo; lives:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The &ldquo;I&rdquo; who has been terminated is the &ldquo;I&rdquo; who was without divinity.</li>
		<li>The &ldquo;I&rdquo; who still lives is the &ldquo;I&rdquo; into which God has been added.</li>
		<li>The old &ldquo;I&rdquo; had nothing of God in it, whereas the new &ldquo;I&rdquo; has received the divine life.</li>
		<li>The old &ldquo;I&rdquo; has become the new &ldquo;I&rdquo; because God as life has been added to it.</li>
		<li>The new &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the &ldquo;I&rdquo; who came into being when the old &ldquo;I&rdquo; was resurrected and had God added to it.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We and Christ do not have two lives; rather, we have one life and one living:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We live by Him, and He lives in us&mdash;John 6:57.</li>
		<li>If we do not live, He does not live, and if He does not live, we cannot live.</li>
		<li>Christ lives in us by causing and enabling us to live with Him&mdash;14:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; the natural person, is inclined to keep the law that I might be perfect (Phil. 3:6), but God wants me to live Christ that God may be expressed in me through Him; hence, God&rsquo;s economy is that &ldquo;I&rdquo; be crucified in Christ&rsquo;s death and that Christ live in me in His resurrection.</li>

<h1 class="title">Not Nullifying the Grace of God<br />

the Grace of God in Our Spirit</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 2:20-21; 5:4; 3:2, 5; 6:17-18</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God&rsquo;s eternal economy is for His people to enjoy Him as the Triune God who has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension so that they might be constituted with Him for His corporate expression today in the church life and in the next age and for eternity in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 3:8-11; cf. Rev. 1:11-12; 21:2.</li>
<li>Grace is Christ Himself, the embodiment of the Triune God, as the life-giving Spirit for our enjoyment; to nullify the grace of God means that in our experience we deny Christ the opportunity to live in us and do not live by the Spirit&mdash;John 1:1, 14, 16-17; Gal. 2:20; 1 Cor. 15:10, 45b; Gal. 2:21; 4:19; 5:25; cf. Col. 2:19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To go back to the law is to reject this grace, to nullify this grace, to fall from grace&mdash;Gal. 2:21; 5:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To fall from grace is to be brought to nought, reduced to nothing, separated from Christ, deprived of all profit from Christ&mdash;cf. John 15:4-5.</li>
		<li>The present evil, religious age keeps people away from the real enjoyment of Christ; the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover Christ as everything to us for our enjoyment&mdash;Gal. 1:4; 2 Cor. 11:2-3; 1 Cor. 1:9.</li>
		<li>If we go to anything other than Christ, such as the law or character improvement, and do not cleave to Christ that we may enjoy Him all the time, our enjoyment of Christ will be confiscated&mdash;cf. Col. 2:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to stand fast in the grace into which we have entered&mdash;Rom. 5:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we would be those who do not nullify the grace of God, we need to abide in Christ, which is to remain in the processed Triune God&mdash;John 15:4-5.</li>
		<li>Furthermore, we need to enjoy Christ, especially by eating Him (6:57b).</li>
		<li>Then we should go on to be one spirit with Christ (1 Cor. 6:17), to walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25), to deny the natural &ldquo;I&rdquo; (2:20), and to abandon the flesh (5:24).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Galatians begins with our being rescued from the present evil age, and it ends with the grace of the Lord with our spirit; we need to be rescued out of the present evil age of religion, which is mostly in our mind, to the wonderful enjoyment of Christ in our spirit&mdash;1:4; 6:18; John 4:24.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to be those who are receiving and enjoying the grace of the Lord in our spirit; the receiving of Christ as the Spirit of grace is a lifelong, continuous matter&mdash;John 1:16; Heb. 10:29b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Day by day a marvelous divine transmission should be taking place: God is supplying the Spirit of grace bountifully, and we should be receiving the Spirit of grace continually&mdash;Gal. 3:2-5; John 3:34:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The way to open ourselves to the heavenly transmission to receive the supply of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of grace is to exercise our spirit to pray and call on the Lord&mdash;1 Thes. 5:16-18; Rom. 10:12-13.</li>
		<li>As we receive the Triune God as our grace and enjoy Him as grace, we shall gradually become one with Him organically; He will become our constituent, and we shall become His expression&mdash;2 Cor. 1:12; 12:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the grace of God, is the bountiful supply of the Triune God (who is embodied in the Son and realized as the life-giving Spirit) enjoyed by us through the exercise of our human spirit; grace is in our spirit for our remaining in God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Gal. 6:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Grace is the moving, acting, and anointing of the Spirit within us, and our spirit is the only place where we can experience grace&mdash;v. 18; Heb. 10:29b.</li>
		<li>The way to receive and enjoy grace is to turn to the spirit, exercise the spirit, and enthrone the Lord:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The throne of grace is in our spirit, and we need to receive the abundance of grace into our inward parts so that grace may reign within us for us to reign in life over Satan, sin, and death&mdash;Heb. 4:16; Rom. 5:17, 21; cf. Rev. 4:2.</li>
			<li>Whenever we come to the throne of grace by turning to our spirit and calling on the name of the Lord, we should enthrone the Lord, giving Him the headship, the kingship, and the lordship within us&mdash;Col 1:18b; Rev. 2:4.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s throne is the source of the flowing grace; whenever we fail to enthrone the Lord, dethroning Him, the flow of grace stops&mdash;22:1.</li>
			<li>If we enthrone the Lord Jesus within us, the Spirit as the river of water of life will flow out from the throne of grace to supply us; in this way we shall receive grace and enjoy grace&mdash;v. 1; <em>Hymns,</em> #770.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As we bear the brands of Jesus, we enjoy the grace of Christ&mdash;Gal. 6:17-18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word <em>brands</em> in verse 17 refers to the marks branded on slaves to indicate their owners; with Paul, a slave of Christ (Rom. 1:1), the brands were physically the scars of his wounds received in his faithful service to his Master (2 Cor. 11:23-27).</li>
	<li>Spiritually, the brands of Jesus signify the characteristics of the life that he lived, a life like the one the Lord Jesus lived on this earth; such a life is continually crucified (John 12:24), does the will of God (6:38), does not seek its own glory but the glory of God (7:18), and is submissive and obedient to God, even unto the death of the cross (Phil. 2:8).</li>
	<li>If we bear the brands of Jesus and live a crucified life, we shall enjoy the grace of Christ as the supply of the life-giving Spirit in our spirit for us to minister Christ as God&rsquo;s grace to God&rsquo;s household&mdash;3:10; 2 Cor. 4:10-11; Eph. 3:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The grace of the Lord Jesus dispensed to His believers throughout the New Testament age consummates in the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God&rsquo;s good pleasure in uniting, mingling, and incorporating Himself with man for His glorious enlargement and expression&mdash;Rev. 22:21; Eph. 2:10.</li>

	<li>Faith is the unique way for God to carry out His New Testament economy with man&mdash;Heb. 11:6.</li>
	<li>In the New Testament, faith bears two denotations&mdash;objective and subjective:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the objective denotation, faith refers to the entire revelation of the New Testament concerning the person of Christ and His redemptive work&mdash;Acts 6:7; 14:22; Rom. 16:26; 1 Cor. 16:13; 1 Tim. 1:19b; Jude 3, 20.</li>
		<li>In the subjective denotation, faith refers to the act of believing&mdash;Luke 18:8; Mark 11:22; 1 Tim. 1:19a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The economy of God is a matter in faith, that is, in the sphere and element of faith, in God through Christ.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is to dispense Himself into His chosen people, is not in the natural realm nor in the work of the law but in the spiritual sphere of the new creation through regeneration by faith in Christ&mdash;Gal. 6:14-15; 3:23-26:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By faith we are born of God to be His sons, partaking of His life and nature to express Him&mdash;v. 26; John 1:12-13; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>

<li>&ldquo;He who was formerly persecuting us is now announcing as the gospel the faith...&rdquo;&mdash;Gal. 1:23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Galatians 1:23 faith implies our believing in Christ, taking His person and redemptive work as the object of our faith&mdash;1 Tim. 3:9; 2 Tim. 4:7; cf. 1 Tim. 6:10.</li>
	<li>The faith, replacing the law by which God dealt with His people in the Old Testament, became the principle by which God deals with His people in the New Testament&mdash;Gal. 3:22-24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This faith characterizes the believers in Christ and distinguishes them from the keepers of law; this is the main emphasis of the book of Galatians.</li>
		<li>The law of the Old Testament stresses letters and ordinances, whereas the faith of the New Testament emphasizes Spirit and life.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law&rdquo;&mdash;2:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Faith is the unique requirement for people to contact God in His New Testament economy&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; Heb. 11:6.</li>
	<li>The faith in Christ by which the believers are justified is related to their appreciation of the person of the Son of God as the most precious One&mdash;12:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The experiential definition of faith is that faith is the preciousness of Jesus infused into us.</li>
		<li>Genuine faith is Christ Himself infused into us to become our ability to believe in Him; after the Lord Jesus has been infused into us, He spontaneously becomes our faith.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we believe in Christ, we enter into Him; we believe ourselves into Christ and thereby become one spirit with Him&mdash;John 3:15; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>

<li>&ldquo;The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me&rdquo;&mdash;Gal. 2:20b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Faith is the way for God&rsquo;s people to apprehend, comprehend, grasp, enjoy, and participate in all that God is to His people through His having been processed.</li>
	<li>The faith of the Son of God refers to the faith of Jesus Christ in us (v. 16), which becomes the faith by which we believe in Him&mdash;3:22; Rom. 3:22, 26.</li>
	<li>As we hear Him and treasure Him, He causes faith to be generated in us, enabling us to believe in Him&mdash;Matt. 17:5; Heb. 12:2:

<li>&ldquo;Did you receive the Spirit out of the works of law or out of the hearing of faith?&rdquo;&mdash;Gal. 3:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Both the receiving of the Spirit and the supplying of the Spirit are out of the hearing of faith, not out of the works of law&mdash;v. 5.</li>
	<li>In the Old Testament there was a dispensation of law, but in the New Testament there is a dispensation of faith:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Faith is related to the Spirit and trusts in the operation of the Spirit, who is the realization of Christ&mdash;2:20; 3:14.</li>
		<li>In the New Testament, faith replaces the law, that we may live Christ by the Spirit&mdash;vv. 22-25.</li>
		<li>To receive the Spirit out of the hearing of faith is God&rsquo;s revealed way; it is in the light of God&rsquo;s revelation and issues in life and glory&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 6, 10-11, 30.</li>
		<li>It is by the hearing of faith that we received the Spirit so that we might participate in God&rsquo;s promised blessing and live Christ&mdash;Gal. 3:14; 2:20.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God&rsquo;s eternal economy is the dispensing of Himself into His chosen people to make them His sons for His corporate expression; sonship is the focal point of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Gal. 4:4-7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy by predestinating us unto sonship&mdash;Eph. 1:4-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The choosing of God&rsquo;s people to be holy is for the purpose of their being made sons of God, participating in the divine sonship.</li>
		<li>To be made holy&mdash;to be sanctified by God by His putting Himself into us and then mingling His nature with us&mdash;is the process, the procedure, whereas to be sons of God is the aim, the goal, and is a matter of our being joined to the Son of God and conformed to the very image of the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Rom. 8:29; Col. 1:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Sanctification is for sonship; God&rsquo;s sanctifying us is His &ldquo;sonizing&rdquo; our entire being to make us His sons in a full way&mdash;Heb. 2:10-11; 1 Thes. 5:23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The regenerating sanctification in our spirit brings forth many sons of God to form an organism for God&rsquo;s corporate expression, which is the organic Body of Christ, the church&mdash;John 1:12-13; 2 Pet. 1:4; Gal. 3:26.</li>
		<li>The transforming sanctification in our soul transforms the regenerated believers by renewing and conforming them to the glorious image of Christ that they may become a heritage of worth, a treasure to God as God&rsquo;s private possession&mdash;Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29; Eph. 1:11, 14, 18.</li>
		<li>The consummating sanctification in our body transfigures the believers&rsquo; body by redeeming their vile body into God&rsquo;s glory that they may be fully and wholly sanctified in their spirit, soul, and body to be a consummated corporation of God&rsquo;s many sons who are matured in the processed Triune God as their life that they may express God as the New Jerusalem for eternity&mdash;Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:23; Rev. 21:2, 7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We are the sons of God because we have believed and have been baptized into Christ, we have put on Christ, and thus, we are all one in Christ; this is to enter into Christ, to express Christ by living Him, and to practice the church life as the one new man in the reality of the divine sonship&mdash;Gal. 3:26-28.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ&rsquo;s judicial redemption is to bring us out of the custody of the law into the sonship of God that we may enjoy His organic salvation, His divine &ldquo;sonizing&rdquo;; the goal of Christ&rsquo;s redemption is sonship&mdash;4:4-6; Rom. 5:10:

		<li>God sent forth the Spirit of His Son, the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), to impart His life with His nature into us that we might become His sons in reality (Gal. 4:6; 1 John 5:11-12; 2 Pet. 1:4).</li>
		<li>The Spirit of the Son is another form of the Son; when the Son died on the cross, He was Christ, and when He enters into us, He is the Spirit&mdash;John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&rdquo;&mdash;Gal. 4:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Abba</em> is an Aramaic word, and <em>Father</em> is the translation of the Greek word <em>Pater;</em> the combining of the Aramaic title with the Greek title expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father, implying an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father&mdash;Mark 14:36; Heb. 5:7; Lam. 3:55-56; cf. Luke 15:1, 20-24.</li>
		<li>The Spirit of God&rsquo;s Son was sent into our hearts; actually, the Spirit of God came into our spirit at the time of our regeneration (John 3:6; Rom. 8:16), because our spirit is hidden in our heart (1 Pet. 3:4).</li>
		<li>On the one hand, we who have received a spirit of sonship cry in this spirit, &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; (Rom. 8:15); on the other hand, the Spirit of God&rsquo;s Son is crying in our hearts, &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; (Gal. 4:6).</li>
		<li>This indicates that our regenerated spirit and the Spirit of God are mingled as one (1 Cor. 6:17), and that our spirit is in our heart.</li>
		<li>This also indicates that the sonship of God is realized by us through our subjective experience in the depth of our being&mdash;cf. Matt. 5:3, 8.</li>
		<li>The more we cry, &ldquo;Abba, Father,&rdquo; in the spirit, the deeper will be the sweet and intimate sense in our heart in our relationship with our Father.</li>
		<li>When we cry, &ldquo;Abba, Father,&rdquo; the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are God&rsquo;s children, possessing His life; such a witnessing also limits us and restricts us to a living and walk that are according to His life, in keeping with our being children of God&mdash;Rom. 8:15-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Since we are God&rsquo;s sons, we are also heirs who are qualified to inherit the Father&rsquo;s estate, all the riches of what He is to us, for eternity&mdash;4:13-14; 8:17; Gal. 3:29; Titus 3:7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul&rsquo;s preaching was to bring forth Christ, the Son of the living God, in the believers; he was travailing that Christ might be formed in them for their full sonship&mdash;Gal. 4:19; cf. 1:15-16; 2:20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To have Christ formed in us is to allow the all-inclusive Spirit, as the blessing of the gospel, to occupy every part of our inner being, to have Christ fully grown in us&mdash;3:14; Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:15-16.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s being formed in us is needed that we may be sons of full age and heirs to inherit God&rsquo;s promised blessing, and that we may mature in the divine sonship&mdash;Heb. 6:1a.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s being formed in us is for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem as the aggregate of the divine sonship for the corporate expression of the Triune God&mdash;2:10; Rev. 21:7, 10-11.</li>

	<li>For the accomplishment of His economy, the Father first sent forth the Son to redeem us, and then the Father sent forth the Spirit of the Son to impart His life into us that we might become His sons in reality&mdash;Gal. 4:4, 6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first One sent the second One and was still one with the second One.</li>
		<li>The first One sent the third One, and the third One was still one with the second One and the first One; this is the oneness in the Godhead.</li>
		<li>There is also a distinction among the three; all the beauties and excellencies exhibited by the Divine Trinity come from this distinction&mdash;Matt. 28:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God&mdash;Gal. 3:2, 5, 14; 5:5, 16, 18, 25; 6:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The New Testament reveals that our God is the processed and consummated Triune God, the One who has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection&mdash;John 1:14; 6:57a; Heb. 9:14; Rom. 1:3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Processed</em> refers to the steps through which the Triune God has passed in the divine economy; <em>consummated</em> indicates that the process has been completed.</li>
		<li>Although God is eternal and unchanging in His nature and substance, He has passed through a process in His economy&mdash;John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
		<li>Our God today is not a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God, but a processed God.</li>
		<li>Before His incarnation God was unprocessed, having only the divine nature, but through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God was processed and consummated to become the Spirit&mdash;John 7:39.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The processed Triune God is a flowing God&mdash;Jer. 2:13; John 4:14; 7:37-38:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the origin, the Father is the fountain of living waters; as the embodiment and expression of the Father, the Son is the spring, the emergence of the fountain; and as the transmission, the Spirit is the river&mdash;Jer. 2:13; John 4:10, 14; Rev. 22:1.</li>
		<li>The Father as love is the fountain, the Son as grace is the spring, and the Spirit as the fellowship is the flowing river&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The processed and consummated Triune God is <em>the Spirit</em>&mdash;Gal. 3:2, 5, 14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We all need to receive a vision of the Spirit&mdash;the compound of the Triune God, the man Jesus, His human living, His death, and His resurrection&mdash;John 7:39; Acts 16:7; Rom. 8:10-11; Phil. 1:19; Gal. 3:14.</li>
		<li>The Spirit is the processed, compound, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified, consummated Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God to be the eternal portion of His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, renewed, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite people as their life, life supply, and everything.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s economy is to give Himself to us as the Spirit&mdash;vv. 2, 5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The term <em>the consummated Spirit</em> indicates that the Spirit has been processed and thus has become the consummated Spirit&mdash;John 7:39; Gal. 3:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit is the Triune God after He has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection&mdash;John 7:39.</li>
		<li>Having passed through all the steps of the process, the Triune God is now the consummated Spirit as the blessing of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Gen. 1:1-2; Gal. 3:14.</li>
		<li>Concerning the consummated Spirit, there are three major and crucial points:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Spirit of God has been compounded to become the compound ointment, as revealed in Exodus 30:23-25.</li>
			<li>The Spirit was &ldquo;not yet&rdquo; before Jesus&rsquo; glorification in resurrection, as referred to in John 7:39.</li>
			<li>The Spirit is considered the seven Spirits of God to function as the seven lamps before the throne of God and the seven eyes of the Lamb, as revealed in Revelation 1:4, 4:5, and 5:6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The consummated Spirit, the compound Spirit, is the divine and mystical realm into which the believers in Christ may enter today&mdash;John 14:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Christian life is the living of the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit in the believers&mdash;Gal. 5:16, 18, 25; 6:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Triune God has been processed to be the consummated Spirit to live in us, the believers in Christ&mdash;John 7:39; Gal. 3:14; 6:18.</li>
	<li>To live the Christian life is to live the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>
	<li>The normal Christian life depends upon our knowing and experiencing the Spirit&mdash;Gal. 3:14.</li>
	<li>The proper Christian life is a life of receiving the Spirit continually&mdash;vv. 2, 5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Eventually, the Spirit as the totality of the processed Triune God becomes one with the church, who is now fully matured to be the bride&mdash;Rev. 22:17:

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 5:16, 18, 25; 6:8, 15-16</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Spirit in Galatians 5:16 and 25 is the processed Triune God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In these verses <em>the Spirit</em> refers to the Spirit indwelling our spirit and mingled with our spirit&mdash;3:2, 5, 14; 6:1, 18.</li>
	<li>Instead of trying to fulfill the law, we should walk by the Spirit, by the processed Triune God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we are led by the Spirit, we are not under the law, for the Spirit of life is our guiding principle, regulating our Christian walk in our regenerated spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 4.</li>
		<li>To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent upon the Spirit and regulated by the Spirit, not by the law&mdash;Gal. 5:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The believers have the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwelling in their spirit, and they should live, walk, and have their being by this Spirit.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is wholly a matter of walking by the Spirit to live Christ&mdash;vv. 16, 25; Phil. 1:21a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>According to the Bible, every believer in Christ should have two kinds of walk by the Spirit&mdash;Gal. 5:16, 25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because God is purposeful and seeks to reach His goal, He charges us to have two kinds of walk by the Spirit: the walk which builds up a proper daily living and the walk in line with the divine rules and principles to reach the goal established by God and to fulfill His purpose&mdash;vv. 16, 25.</li>
	<li>The Greek word for <em>walk</em> in verse 16, <em>peripateo,</em> denotes the daily, ordinary, regular walk; it means to move, to deport oneself, to act in ordinary daily life, implying a common, habitual daily walk&mdash;Rom. 6:4; 8:4; Phil. 3:17-18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first kind of walk by the Spirit is a walk in which we are one spirit with the Lord&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
		<li>In Galatians 5:16 to walk by the Spirit actually means to live Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		<li>To walk by the Spirit in Galatians 5:16 equals to live by the Spirit in verse 25.</li>
		<li>In the first kind of walk by the Spirit, we take the Spirit as the essence of our life&mdash;v. 16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This means that our essence is the Triune God as our constituent.</li>
			<li>Whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have will be by the Spirit as our essence.</li>
			<li>If we take the Spirit as our essence and crucify our flesh (v. 24), every aspect of our daily walk will be by the Spirit.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>If we would be sons of God in reality and practicality, we must walk by the Spirit and not by the flesh&mdash;3:26; 4:6; Rom. 8:14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Because we are sons, God wants us to walk by the Spirit as His sons.</li>
			<li>If we would trust in the Spirit, we must stand on the ground of being God&rsquo;s sons, not on the ground of being God&rsquo;s creatures&mdash;Gal. 4:6.</li>
			<li>Because we are God&rsquo;s sons and because the processed Triune God is working within us toward the goal of sonship, we should walk by the Spirit&mdash;3:26; 5:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Greek word for <em>walk</em> in Galatians 5:25, <em>stoicheo,</em> denotes an official walk, a walk to carry out a certain commission; it means to walk according to rules&mdash;to walk in line, to march in military rank, to keep in step and, thus, to walk in an orderly manner&mdash;6:16; Rom. 4:12; Phil. 3:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we would have the second kind of walk by the Spirit&mdash;the walk for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;we need to learn to walk by the Spirit as our way, rule, and principle&mdash;Gal. 5:25.</li>
		<li>The unique pathway toward God&rsquo;s goal is the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit; He alone should be the principle, the rule, the path, according to which we should walk.</li>
		<li>By uttering this word about walking by the Spirit as our rule, Paul eliminated law, religion, tradition, doctrine, and regulations as the rule.</li>
		<li>The second kind of walk by the Spirit is intimately related to the new creation&mdash;6:15-16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Paul connects the second kind of walk with &ldquo;this rule&rdquo;&mdash;the rule of being a new creation&mdash;v. 16.</li>
			<li>The rule by which we should walk is the rule of being a new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
			<li>In Galatians 5:25 to walk by the Spirit is to walk in the new creation:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is in the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation&mdash;6:15.</li>
				<li>2) We need to walk by the rule which is the Triune God to be our life and our living; to live in this way by the new creation is our rule.</li>
				<li>3) The new creation is a matter of God&rsquo;s chosen people taking the all-inclusive Spirit as their goal, aiming at Him, being one with Him, and, as a result, having the divine element transfused into them to reconstitute them and make them new&mdash;v. 8.</li>
				<li>4) We should walk by the principle of the new creation&mdash;vv. 15-16:
					<ol class="none">
					<li>a) The basic principle of the new creation is that we should live by the divine life&mdash;2:20; John 6:57.</li>
					<li>b) To live the new creation is to walk by the divine life and divine nature as a governing principle&mdash;Gal. 6:15-16.</li>
					<li>c) Walking by the principle of the new creation is mysterious because it is an organic matter altogether related to life&mdash;John 3:8.</li>
					<li>d) If we would live the new creation, we must do everything in oneness with the Triune God&mdash;15:4-5; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
					</ol></li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>To live the new creation is to live, walk, have our being, and do all things, great or small, with the element of God&mdash;Gal. 6:15-16.</li>
			<li>If we &ldquo;walk by this rule,&rdquo; we will live neither a religious life nor an unreligious life, but we will live a new creation as sons of God&mdash;v. 15; 3:26.</li>

and Sowing unto the Spirit to Reap Eternal Life</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 5:16-26; 6:7-10</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>We can either walk by the Spirit to bear the fruit of the Spirit or walk by flesh to manifest the works of the flesh&mdash;Gal. 5:16-26; Phil. 3:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The flesh is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man, whereas the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God; to walk by the Spirit, therefore, is to walk by the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit&mdash;Gen. 6:3; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:16.</li>
	<li>When we walk by the Spirit (live, move, and have our entire being by the Spirit), we will bear the fruit of the Spirit&mdash;Gal. 5:16, 22-23.</li>
	<li>What the flesh does is works without life; what the Spirit brings forth is fruit full of life&mdash;vv. 19, 22.</li>
	<li>The fallen life of the old Adam is expressed practically in the flesh, and the works of the flesh are different aspects of such a fleshly expression&mdash;vv. 19-21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness (which are concerning evil passions), bouts of drunkenness, and carousings (which are concerning dissipation) are related to the lust of the corrupted body.</li>
		<li>Enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger (which are concerning evil moods), factions, divisions, sects, and envyings (which are concerning parties) are related to the fallen soul, which is very closely related to the corrupted body.</li>
		<li>Idolatry and sorcery (which are concerning demonic worship) are related to the deadened spirit.</li>
		<li>Vainglory, provoking, and envying are all of the flesh; these three matters test in a very practical way whether or not we are walking by the Spirit&mdash;vv. 25-26.</li>
		<li>Paul speaks of those who desire to &ldquo;make a good show in the flesh&rdquo; (6:12); to be in the flesh is to be in our natural and external being without the inward reality and spiritual value that are in our regenerated spirit (Rom. 2:28-29; Phil. 3:3).</li>
		<li>If we walk by the Spirit, we shall automatically defeat the flesh and the devil lurking behind the flesh; as we win the war against the flesh in this way, God&rsquo;s purpose to express Christ will be accomplished&mdash;Gal. 5:16-17; 6:17; cf. Exo. 17:8-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the flesh is the expression of the old Adam, so the Spirit is the realization of Christ; Christ is actually lived out as the Spirit, and the items of the fruit of the Spirit are the characteristics of Christ&mdash;cf. Phil. 1:19-21a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention is that we live by the Spirit to express Christ; what we need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is a walk by the Spirit to express Christ in many different virtues for us to be sons of God in reality.</li>
		<li>Our natural attributes do not have anything of the Spirit, whereas the fruit of the Spirit is full of the substance and element of the Spirit.</li>
		<li>Nine items of the fruit of the Spirit, as different expressions of the Spirit, are listed in Galatians 5:22-23 as illustrations: love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and self-control.</li>
		<li>The fruit of the Spirit includes additional items, such as lowliness (Eph. 4:2; Phil. 2:3), compassion (v. 1), godliness (2 Pet. 1:6), righteousness (Rom. 14:17; Eph. 5:9), holiness (1:4; Col. 1:22), and purity (Matt. 5:8).</li>
		<li>The fruit of the Spirit is the fruit of the light in Ephesians 5:9; this fruit is in all goodness (Matt. 19:17), righteousness (Rom. 5:17-18, 21), and truth (John 14:17) for the expression of the Triune God (cf. Exo. 25:37).</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We can either sow unto the Spirit to reap eternal life, or we can sow unto the flesh to reap corruption of the flesh&mdash;Gal. 6:7-10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to Paul&rsquo;s view, human life is a process of sowing; all that we say and do involves the sowing of seeds that will grow and eventually be reaped.</li>
	<li>To sow unto the Spirit means to sow with a view to accomplishing the purpose of the Spirit; this is to have the Spirit as our goal:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Actually, to walk by the Spirit is to sow unto the Spirit&mdash;5:16.</li>
		<li>In our life and living we must aim at the Spirit, taking the Spirit as our goal&mdash;6:8b.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s economy is to give us Himself as the Spirit; nothing is more pleasing to God than for us to take the all-inclusive Spirit, the all-inclusive Triune God, as our unique and eternal goal&mdash;3:5a, 14; cf. Phil. 2:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To sow unto the flesh means to sow with a view to accomplishing the purpose of the flesh; this is to have the flesh as the goal:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>There is no neutral ground between the flesh and the Spirit; our goal is either one or the other&mdash;Rom. 8:6.</li>
		<li>Everything we do is a sowing either unto our own flesh or unto the Spirit, and all our sowing issues in a reaping either of corruption out of the flesh or of eternal life out of the Spirit&mdash;Psa. 126:5; Prov. 22:8a; Hosea 8:7a.</li>
		<li>If we live unto the flesh, what we do as Christian work will not be effective; what counts is not our working but our sowing&mdash;cf. Mark 4:14; Deut. 22:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When our goal is the Spirit, we become a supply of life to others and to the churches&mdash;Gal. 6:10; 2 Cor. 3:6.</li>
	<li>When we sow unto the Spirit, the Spirit makes us a new creation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The new creation is a matter of God&rsquo;s chosen people taking the all-inclusive Spirit as their goal, aiming at Him, being one spirit with Him, and as a result, having the divine element transfused into them to reconstitute them and make them new&mdash;Gal. 6:14-15.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of eternal life, will be the consummate issue and reaping of our sowing unto the Spirit&mdash;v. 8b; John 4:14; Rev. 22:1-2.</li>
		<li>The Lord is sounding out a call in His recovery to take the Spirit as our goal and to live unto Him in everything that there may be a harvest of life eternal; how wonderful that we may have such a glorious goal in life!</li>

		<li>The believers receive the Spirit by the hearing of faith; faith comes out of the hearing of the word&mdash;Gal. 3:2; Rom. 10:17:

			<li>God in His written word is contacted as the living word and applied into us as the word of the Spirit so that we can gain the Triune God, who is able to give life to the dead and call the things not being as being (Rom. 4:17); thus, God embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit is faith.</li>
			<li>The more that God is gained by us in this way, the more He becomes our faith; faith is the subjective God applied to our being.</li>

<li>The new creation is a corporate, divine sonship (Gal. 3:26; 4:5, 7) brought forth through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, the Spirit&rsquo;s regeneration, and God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself into us, and through our entering collectively as the new man into an organic union with the Triune God (6:15; 3:27-29):

	<li>&ldquo;A new creation is what matters&rdquo;&mdash;Gal. 6:15b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The main issue in Galatians is that we are the new creation and that we should live by the new creation through an organic union with the Triune God; the new creation fulfills God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, which to express Himself in His sonship&mdash;4:5; Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:29.</li>
		<li>We need to &ldquo;walk by this rule,&rdquo; by the rule of being a new creation; to walk by this rule is to walk by the Spirit&mdash;Gal. 6:15-16; 5:25:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To live a new creation as sons of God is to walk by the divine life and divine nature as a governing, elementary principle; in this way we shall be a vast, universal, corporate expression of the Triune God as the consummation of the divine sonship.</li>
			<li>We need to walk by the same rule of the new creation, that is, we must pursue Christ as the goal that we may gain Christ to the fullest extent as the prize for the upward calling of God&mdash;Phil. 3:13-16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ, the Spirit, the new creation, and our spirit are the four basic things revealed in the book of Galatians as the underlying thought of God&rsquo;s economy:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s economy, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ; when Christ is realized through the Spirit in our spirit, we become the new creation&mdash;Gal. 1:16; 2:20; 4:19; 3:2-3, 14; 5:16, 25; 6:15, 18.</li>
		<li>Hence, our spirit is vital for us to live the life of the new creation for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;v. 18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Israel of God (v. 16) is the real Israel (Rom. 9:6b; 2:28-29; Phil. 3:3), including all the Gentile and Jewish believers in Christ, who are the true sons of Abraham (Gal. 3:7, 29), who are the household of the faith (6:10), and who are those in the new creation (v. 15):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The real Israel, the spiritual Israel, is the church; there is the need for the Lord to recover the real Israel of God&mdash;v. 16; 3:7, 29.</li>
	<li>Peace rains upon the real Israel of God, upon those who walk by the rule of living a new creation by sowing unto the Spirit&mdash;6:7-10, 15-16.</li>
	<li>Those who are included in the real Israel walk by &ldquo;this rule&rdquo; (v. 16), express God&rsquo;s image, and execute God&rsquo;s authority; they are typified by Jacob, who was transformed into Israel, a prince of God and a victor (Gen. 32:27-28):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Jacob we see God the Father who loves man and chooses man&mdash;Mal. 1:2; Rom. 9:10-13.</li>
		<li>In Jacob we see our being destined to live a struggling life all our days through the discipline of the Spirit for the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work within us&mdash;Gen. 32:24-32; Heb. 12:6-11; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
		<li>In Jacob we see God the Spirit who works in all things for the good of His lovers, transforms man, and makes man mature in the divine life that man may be able to bless all the people, to rule over all the earth, and to satisfy all the people with God the Son as the life supply&mdash;Gen. 27:41; 28:1&mdash;35:10; chs. 37, 39&mdash;49; Rom. 8:28-29.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>By living the mingled life of the new creation, we shall be the Israel of God on earth today, His princes and victors executing His authority and representing His government&mdash;cf. Rev. 2:26-27.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our destiny is not only to be sons of God; it is to be kings reigning in the kingdom of God; Paul&rsquo;s word about the Israel of God implies that we need to live in a kingly way with a kingly walk&mdash;Rom. 5:17, 21.</li>
		<li>To be proper sons of God it is sufficient to have the fruit of the Spirit, but to be kings, the Israel of God, we need another kind of living, a particular kind of walk by the Spirit; we need both the living of the sons of God and that of the Israel of God&mdash;Gal. 5:16, 25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>This kingly, overcoming living builds up the Body of Christ to issue in the ultimate consummation of the Israel of God, the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 21:2.</li>
