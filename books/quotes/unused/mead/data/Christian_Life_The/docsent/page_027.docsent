   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to be transformed from one form to another form.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A mere outward change is not transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Transformation is a metabolic change within by the addition of a new element.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Confucius taught renewing too, but his kind of renewing was outward without any new element added.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Morticians use cosmetics to make the faces of corpses look colorful outwardly, but this is not transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are nourished with organic food, this nourishing carries out a kind of metabolic transformation within us to give us a healthy appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Transformation is a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope that all of us would change in a metabolic way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should be beautiful metabolically in an organic transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word transformed is used only two times in the New Testament in 2 Corinthians 3:18 and in Romans 12:2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit with the Lord as the element changes our being metabolically to accomplish transformation in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 12:2 charges us not to be fashioned according to this age but to be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would encourage us to study these wonderful verses with the help of the notes in the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you read 2 Corinthians 3:18 plus Romans 12:2 with all the notes, you will receive much help.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all need to experience the transforming Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>SEALING THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ephesians 1:13 shows us that the Spirit functions to seal the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The seal needs the sealing ink.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a piece of paper is sealed, the sealing ink saturates the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the sealed paper bears the appearance, the image, of the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, the sealing transfuses the element of the ink into the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then the sealing ink and the paper are mingled together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sealing of the Spirit is a fine point of the function of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Holy Spirit today is on us as a seal and is continually sealing us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are like the paper absorbing the sealing element of the Holy Spirit as the seal into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because we have been sealed, we bear a mark indicating that we belong to our God, that we are God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we put our seal upon a book, that seal indicates that the book is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God put His Spirit as His seal upon us, indicating that we are His possession.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A pledge is a guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit as the pledge within us guarantees that God is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sealing indicates that we are God's inheritance, and the pledging guarantees that God is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is clearly revealed in Ephesians 1:13-14.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The crucial word in verse 13 is sealed, and the crucial word in verse 14 is pledge.</S>
