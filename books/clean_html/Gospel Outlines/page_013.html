<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 3:9</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God governs the universe<br />
<span class="normal">This universe is not without a government or administration. God is the ruler of the universe.</span></li>
<li>Conscience governs the heart<br />
<span class="normal">God governs the universe, and the conscience governs our heart.</span></li>
<li>The condemnation of the conscience<br />
<span class="normal">You stole something and lied, but your conscience makes you uneasy and causes a feeling of guilt; this is the condemnation of the conscience. <em>Touch the feeling on this point.</em></span></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s condemnation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Condemnation of the conscience proves God&rsquo;s condemnation.</li>
	<li>Condemnation of the conscience represents God&rsquo;s condemnation.</li>
	<li>Condemnation of the conscience brings in God&rsquo;s condemnation, therefore, whatever the conscience condemns, God also condemns.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s condemnation exceeds the condemnation of the conscience.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s judgment
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Condemnation seems to follow judgment, but the Bible shows us that we are condemned first, then judged. We are not waiting to be condemned before the great white throne; rather, we are condemned first, and then we will be judged later on.</li>
	<li>All those who are condemned today shall be judged before the great white throne. The fate of the judged ones will be eternal suffering in the lake of fire.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to avoid judgment
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus bore our sins and was judged for us.</li>
	<li>Believe in the Lord Jesus and we shall not be condemned (John 3:18; 5:24; Heb. 9:27).</li>
	</ol></li>
