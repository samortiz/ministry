In order to see the importance of the vital groups, we need a clear view of the entire Bible.<h2 class=head1>I. GOD&#8217;S MOVE ON THE EARTH FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HIS ETERNAL ECONOMY</h2><p>The Bible is a book written by God Himself, and He is the living and moving God. He has His heart&#8217;s desire and His own purpose, so in eternity past He made an economy to do something for Himself. If we read the sixty-six books of the Bible thoroughly under God&#8217;s enlightenment, we can see clearly that God&#8217;s move on this earth for the accomplishment of His eternal economy has only four steps. His move is first, through the Adamic race; second, through the Abrahamic race; third, through the church; and fourth, through the overcomers. My heavy burden is not with the first three steps, but with the last one. All of the following messages will be concerning this last step, the step of God&#8217;s move through the overcomers.<h2 class=head2>A. Through the Adamic Race</h2><p>God&#8217;s move on the earth for the accomplishment of His eternal economy was first through the Adamic race.<h2 class=head3>1. With the Tree of Life as the Center and the Goal</h2><p>God&#8217;s move through the Adamic race was with the tree of life as the center and the goal (Gen. 2:9). In every step of God&#8217;s move on this earth, there is a definite center and goal. In the first step, the tree of life is the center and goal. This tree is actually a sign of God Himself as our life.<h2 class=head3>2. God&#8217;s Intention</h2><h2 class=head4>a. To Be Taken by Man as Life</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention was to be taken by man as life. He created man and put man in front of the tree of life, indicating that it was good for man to take and eat (Gen. 2:9). Then man could have God as his life.<h2 class=head4>b. To Be One with Man in an Organic Union</h2><p>God wanted to be one with man in an organic union. We may say that we are one with a certain person, but we cannot have an organic union with him. God wanted to be one with man in a particular way, in the way of an organic union.<h2 class=head4>c. To Have a Body in Humanity as the Corporate Expression of the Triune God</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention was to have a Body in humanity to be the corporate expression of the Triune God (Eph. 1:23). From the very first page of the Bible, God revealed Himself as theTriune God, and He needs a Body as a corporate expression to manifest Him.<h2 class=head3>3. Man&#8217;s Failure</h2><h2 class=head4>a. Distracted from God&#8217;s Ordained Line of Life</h2><p>Man&#8217;s failure was that he was distracted from God&#8217;s ordained line of life (Gen. 3:24) to another line, signified by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. There were two trees signifying two sources, two lines, and two centers with two goals.<h2 class=head4>b. Becoming Flesh</h2><p>Because of man&#8217;s failure, he became not merely sinful or worldly but flesh (Gen. 6:3a).<h2 class=head3>4. God&#8217;s Judgment</h2><p>After man&#8217;s failure, God&#8217;s judgment came in.<h2 class=head4>a. Firstly by Water and Then by Fire</h2><p>God judged the fallen race firstly by water, by the flood, at Noah&#8217;s time (Gen. 6:17), and then by fire from heaven to burn Sodom and Gomorrah (19:24-25).<h2 class=head4>b. To Destroy the Fallen Race</h2><p>The final outcome was that God destroyed the fallen race. God could not get through with Adam and his descendants, so He went to another race.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Training and the Practice of the Vital Groups &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
