You cannot measure others by your own spiritual standard, and you cannot require others to be the same as you are. Whatever others ask for, you have to give to them. If they want better clothing, you should do your best to satisfy them. You should only consecrate what you have when others are motivated to do the same. The more you contend for these things, the more tightly they will hold onto them. The more you yield, the more they will let go. Nevertheless, as long as your heart is delivered from money and fleshly desires, you have done a great thing already.</P><P>One sister refused to go to the movie with her husband after she was saved. The more her husband wanted her to do it, the more she would oppose, and the more she would give her husband a long face. When the husband came home at night, she would not open the door in order to let him know that she was not happy with him. One day, she came to me in tears. I told her, "Your attitude was totally wrong. Your husband has not seen what you have seen. You cannot treat him this way. You should happily accompany him to the entrance of the cinema and say to him, `Sorry, I cannot go in, but I will wait for you at home. You can go in and watch the movie. I will go home and prepare some nice food for you.' In the meantime, you should open the door and wait for him to come home." Let me tell you, this is the proper Christian way.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_243.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_245.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 244</div><br></body></html>
