<h2 class="head1">THE DIVIDING OF THE SOUL AND SPIRIT AND<br />THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN</h2><p>Question: What is the difference between the sense of the spirit and the feelings of the soul?</p><p>Answer: The more one tries to distinguish the sense of the spirit and the feelings of the soul, the more confused he becomes. Only an experienced person can differentiate the spirit from the soul. It is God's business to divide our spirit from our soul. Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow." As God performs a special work of breaking and tearing down our outer man, we will be clear about the dividing of our soul from our spirit. We all have strong spots. Once these strong spots are crushed, our spirit will come out, and our soul will be put to use. When the outer man is broken, the inner man will be released.</p><p>Our outer man is a shell; it exists on this earth for the purpose of interacting with outward circumstances. The inner man is our true self. Those whose spirit is divided from their soul have a great gulf separating the outer man from the inner man. Those whose spirit and soul are separated can be very busy in the outer man, but their inner man is untouched. It is not affected by the outside world, and it remains in God. For example, one brother had a very tragic experience. Yet under God's special mercy, he remained calm and peaceful inside in spite of the outward pains. God set the peace as a gulf, a separating wall, between him and his outer man.</p><p>It is God's great mercy to break down our outer man. The breaking enables us to always abide in the inner man. When the outer man is broken, the inner man seems to have moved its home. It is no longer affected by the outer man. The inner man belongs to us; it is deep, and it is spiritual. The outer man is shallow; it is of the flesh. If the outer man is not broken, we will never be able to tell the difference between the outer man and the inner man.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRISTIAN VIRTUE AND WORLDLY ASCETICISM</h2><p>Question: What is the difference between Christian virtue and worldly asceticism?</p><p>Answer: A proper Christian will convey a sense of God to others. He will incite others to worship and glorify God, but those who cultivate themselves merely build up themselves. They only give others a taste of man, and they draw praises to man. The more they practice asceticism, the stronger their self becomes. In fact, the more "virtuous" a person is, the more he gives others the feeling that he is above them. The more a Christian is broken, the less others will be conscious of him, and the humbler he becomes. Others will only touch God in him. The more a worldly person practices self-denial, the greater his self becomes. We find this particularly prevalent in India. Indian philosophy far excels the ethics of most ordinary men and women. Yet no one touches God through this philosophy. A Christian who takes up the cross, however, whether he is a Chinese, a Japanese, or an Englishman, gives others the impression of God. They cause others to worship God and to glorify Him.</p>
