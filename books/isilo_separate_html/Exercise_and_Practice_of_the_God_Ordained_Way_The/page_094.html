Therefore, while one is teaching, all the others must be learning. In this way everyone is exercised. We are all being taught, sometimes by seeing a negative example. We might realize that although someone&#8217;s answer is good, it does not fit the question. We have to learn how to answer in a very fitting way. After going home, we may consider certain questions, so that the next time such a question is raised, we can answer in a better way. Each saint may be able to attend forty-five group meetings in a year. In this time we will all learn very much and our gifts can be developed.<p>Also, in our practice of the group meetings, our teaching should not be too long. If we say a short word to hit the point, this is good enough. We should not try to answer everything in every aspect. We should try to leave more time for others to say something. Then we will learn more.<p>When someone asks a practical question, you should first give them a practical answer, and you should also try to make your answer short. Someone may ask, &#8220;You talk about worshipping God. How do you worship God?&#8221; You may say, &#8220;To worship God is not to bow down or prostrate yourself, which is what many people think. That is not the worship the Bible teaches. To worship God is simply to contact God. When you pray to God, that is your worship to Him. When you sing to God or praise God, that is worship. Even when you are sitting and considering God, that is another kind of worship.&#8221; This answer is good enough. You have spoken, and now you can leave some time for others. Then a sister may conclude the answer to this question by saying, &#8220;In order to pray to God, to praise God, to sing to God, and to call on Him, you have to exercise your spirit. Do not merely call or pray from your throat; you have to exercise your spirit. The Bible tells us in John 4:24 that God is Spirit, so those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit.&#8221; This is not too doctrinal, yet it gives him some practical instruction. If you give someone a good answer, this answer can imply very much teaching.<p>Someone may ask how to read the Bible. There are many ways to answer this question. You may teach him to pray-read the Word. This is not bad, but this is not the best answer. You must give him some direct, brief instruction. You must always consider someone&#8217;s question and not answer anyone according to your thought. You must answer a question according to the asker&#8217;s thought. He has asked how to read the Bible. You might say, &#8220;The best way to read the Bible is simply to read it. Just read it again and again.&#8221; Then you may go further to tell him that the Bible is the Word of God, so you should pray before reading it. Also, you should advise him to read through the Bible consecutively, not skipping from book to book, and that it is better to begin with the New Testament. If he takes these points and practices them, he will receive very much help. If you still have time in the group meeting, you may go a little further, but do not go too far at one time. Do not forget that he is a new learner. If you go too far, he will not be able to pick up that much.<p>Some questions raised by new ones are quite trivial. They are not related to a crucial point, or doctrine, so we should not spend much time on these matters. Some questions are related to basic problems like baptism or calling on the Lord. For these we need to spend more time to answer them properly.<p>A new one may raise a question about what it is to eat and drink God. He may be offended when we speak about this, feeling that this is disrespectful. How should you answer this one? You may immediately turn to John 6 and teach this one; however, before you refer people to the Bible, it is good to give them a very simple and practical answer. You may say, &#8220;God is our supply, but He is a Spirit. This is too mysterious. It is hard to realize how we can receive His supply. The Bible tells us that God is our food and that God is our living water. Since God is our food, we have to eat Him; since God is our living water, we have to drink Him. How can we eat and drink Him? To eat Him is to read His Word, the Bible. When we read the Bible with consideration, we take God in. In this way God becomes our food, a kind of life supply. Then when we pray to Him and call on His name, we take Him in. To take Him in is to drink Him in.&#8221; You all have to learn to give simple answers, yet this simple answer implies a lot of points. This is a good teaching.<p>This matter of eating and drinking God is a big point, so you should spend more time to cover it. However, do not bring in other related points that are not within the thought of the question. It is better to stress one point repeatedly than to bring in a distraction. The problem with this new one is that he feels that to say we eat and drink God is disrespectful. You may say, &#8220;This may sound crude, but we have to consider what God is to us. He is not merely our Lord and the object of our worship; He is life to us. The Bible even tells us that He is our food and our living water. Even the Lord Jesus says that He has come to be the heavenly bread. He Himself tells us that he who eats Him shall live because of Him. We receive food by eating it, not by worshipping the food. If we are going to worship the food, this would be foolish. The more we eat the food, the more we respect it. The Lord is our living water. The more we drink of Him, the more we respect Him. To eat Him fits His purpose regarding us. We do not despise or disregard God because He is our food and our drink. Therefore, we have to eat Him, and we have to drink Him.&#8221; This is to answer the question within the limit of the thought of the question.<p>In the entire recovery, the practice of having group meetings according to the scriptural way has just begun. In the past we did not have the organic practice of the group meetings. You all have to learn very much, therefore you should go forward gradually in the group meetings. After faithfully practicing for about one year, this will be built up as a very positive habit among us. Some in the full-time training who are learning to practice this way will bring this way to every place.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_093.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_095.html">Next</a> </body></html>
