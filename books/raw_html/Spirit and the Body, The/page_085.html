<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LOVE AND TRANSFORMATION<br>FOR THE BODY LIFE</H1><P>In 1 Corinthians 12:31 Paul says, "But desire earnestly the greater gifts" (Gk.). Although Paul does not tell us to reject the lesser gifts, he says to earnestly desire the greater gifts because they are more profitable for the Body life. Thus, we all must learn to desire the greater gifts. By reading 1 Corinthians 12 we can easily see that the greater gifts are those related to the apostles, the prophets, and the teachers. These are the speaking gifts. Furthermore, in 1 Corinthians 14:5 Paul says that prophecy is more profitable to the church than speaking in tongues. In chapter fourteen Paul is trying to impress us that we should care more for prophecy than for speaking in tongues. Just the opposite is seen, however, in today's charismatic movement. In the charismatic movement speaking in tongues, which is the tail, becomes the head.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MOST EXCELLENT WAY</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 12:31 Paul also says, "And yet show I unto you a most excellent way" (Gk.). We should not only desire the greater gifts, but also practice the gifts according to the most excellent way. To have the greater gifts is one thing, and to practice them according to the most excellent way is another. You may have the greater gifts, but you may not have the most excellent way of practicing them. In this message I have the burden to fellowship regarding the most excellent way to practice the gifts.</P><P>The most excellent way is, of course, revealed in 1 Corinthians 13, which is the direct continuation of chapter twelve. First Corinthians 13:1 says, "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal." Sounding brass and tinkling cymbals are sounds without life. Thus, to become sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal means to function without life. We need to pray to the Lord, "Lord, show me the difference between function and life. Show me that it is possible to make sounds, yet not have any life." Paul goes on to say that it is possible to have the gift of prophecy, to understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and to have the faith to remove mountains, and yet not have love. If we have all these without love, we are nothing of life. Furthermore, we may give material things to the poor and even offer our body to be burned and still have no profit, because we do not have love (v. 3). By this we see that we may have many gifts and functions, yet still be short of life.</P>
