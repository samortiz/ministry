When we were living a dry and tasteless (spiritual) life, and we seemed like sprouts in a long drought, He gave us the truth which is like anointing rain to comfort our hearts so we could stand on His Word and be strong.</P><P>I have been teaching in Dairen for four years. In the spring of 1932, I met Brother Chiang Ch'uan Ching. At that time, we both felt hungry and thirsty. We often asked the question:  "How can we be free from spiritual dryness?" Some told us it was by going to worship often. But we were already going often. The answer of the so-called Pentecostal group was: Confess your sins completely and pray for the filling of the Holy Spirit. But we had many doubts about what they were doing. However, every morning we would go up on South Hill very early to read the Bible together. After one semester, we were still as hungry and thirsty as before.</P><P>Later, Brother Chiang went to Chefoo and met Brother Chang Chen Ming. At that time, I was in Dairen, living my lukewarm spiritual life and feeling more and more lonely and dry. In the beginning of the fall of 1932, Brother Chang Chen Ming came from Chefoo to Dairen. Through Brother Chiang, we began to communicate with each other more often. In the summer of 1933, Brother Chang Chen Ming came to Dairen from Shanghai. At that time Brother Chiang was also living in Dairen. We talked about the Lord's word often. Thank God for His grace in causing us to hear His truth and to become freemen and to no longer be under the bondage of the restrictions of false rituals. Although the soul resisted at first, thank God, He finally gave us the power to leave the denominations in a bold way and to meet solidly according to the Lord's command. Thank the Lord for leading Brother Chang Chen Ming to help us so much.</P><P>The will of God is so marvelous that we cannot fathom it. After feeding us for awhile, He caused us to be separated. He tested us! After we had been meeting for two months, Brother Chiang left Dairen and returned home. Brother Chang also was transferred in duties shortly after, so he left Dairen also. At the time we were separated, our souls could not avoid feeling lonely. Brothers Chiang and Chang were closer to each other, so they had the opportunity to talk to each other a few more times. I was alone for a long period of time, but I learned an important lesson. I learned that when we are serious about leaving the denominations, we must do our best to exhort one another among the brothers and meet together. If we find ourselves in a situation where we are alone, we should definitely not turn back to participate in the denominations. If we are not careful to protect ourselves, we may be attacked by the evil one. Day by day, we will get colder and colder and will be more pitiful than when we were in the denominations. I am most immature, so I am most susceptible to attacks. Thank the Lord, He woke me up as I was about to sleep. This spring our school shuffled some personnel, and Brother Chiang came back to Dairen as my colleague. From now on, we can exhort each other again.</P><P>We have received all the issues of Collection of Newsletters. Thank you! I think that Collection of Newsletters is a most important thing among the brothers because everything published in it benefits them. This is especially true in a meeting where there are not many people. It is easy to become tired because there are so few people. In reading this publication, we receive encouragement and exhortation. There are very few people in the meeting in Dairen and we are very immature, so I hope this publication can continue to be sent. I respectfully bless you with peace in the Lord!</P><P>Your little brother,<br>Chang Wen Wei<br>April 14, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM NINGPO, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>Brother Tsai Ch'ing:</P><P>We have been here for seven days now, but this is the first day we have been able to sit down and rest. Actually, Brother Hung is still washing the windows, but my arms and legs will not move anymore. Thank God; we are His workers, not "rabbis" nor "rulers of the synagogues."</P><P>We have already decided on a house at 4 Lo An Lane behind the railway garden in the north shore. This is the same house the sisters saw a long time ago. We paid a deposit of thirty dollars and sixty cents. In the future, we will pay seven dollars and forty cents a month. It is less expensive here than in Shanghai. In these past three or four days, we have been busy with many things&mdash;buying things, sweeping the floor, washing the windows, straightening and arranging, etc. It seems as if "the master is coming and the servants are busy." Actually our heart is just like this. According to ourselves, we could rest and live peacefully, but we are busy now because of Him&mdash;the Lord.</P><P>We have only two fifths of the things we need for our own house. Since God has provided us these two fifths, He will also give us the remaining three fifths. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>Greet the brothers in the Lord for me. I will not write another letter to Brother Ho Yueh Chiao.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Hsu Ta Wei<br>May 13, 1934</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 25: Collection of Newsletters (1) &nbsp; pg 52</div><br></body></html>
