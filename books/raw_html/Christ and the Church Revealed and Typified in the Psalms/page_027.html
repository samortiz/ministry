<p>Verse 6 speaks of His kingdom: “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter.” No doubt this is the kingdom age. After His riding, fighting, and coming back, we have the kingdom with the throne. His throne is for ever and ever, the eternal throne. The authority, the scepter of His kingdom, is a right scepter. This is His reigning. He is God Himself; He will be the King, and He will reign over the entire earth.<p>Following this, the Psalmist comes back to Christ’s character, to His being. “Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness.” Righteousness represents everything related to God; anything righteous is related to God. Wickedness represents everything related to the wicked one, Satan. This means that the Lord loves all the things related to God and hates everything related to the evil one; He loves God and hates Satan. The Psalmist continues, “Therefore God, thy God…” In verse 6 he says, “O God,” but in this verse he says, “thy God.” This means that Christ is God, and God is Christ’s. “O God, thy God!” Praise the Lord, it is wonderful; we cannot explain it.<p>“Thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions.” Because He loves righteousness and hates wickedness, God has anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His companions. This verse does not mean that His companions are not anointed, but that they are anointed under Him. We are His companions, His anointed companions. He is anointed above us, and we are anointed under Him. He is the Anointed One, and we are the anointed ones, His anointed companions.<p>Verse 8: “All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia.” Garments in typology signify deeds or acts. So here we have the Lord’s deeds and actions, which smell of myrrh and aloes. In John 19:39-40 we see that Christ was buried with these two spices—myrrh and aloes. Hence these signify the preciousness and sweetness of the Lord’s death. Cassia is a kind of root that produces a fragrant oil which is good for healing. Therefore, cassia signifies the fragrance of Christ’s resurrection. Thus, with all the doings of the Lord, there is the sweet fragrance of His death and resurrection. Whatever He does, whatever He works, is filled with the savor of His death and resurrection—the myrrh and the aloes plus the cassia.<p>The Psalmist continues, “Out of the ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.” Ivory is a kind of bone, and bone in typology signifies the unbroken, resurrection life of Christ. Not one of Christ’s bones was broken (John 19:33, 36); His bones were unbreakable. This signifies that His life can never be broken. Hence, the ivory palaces signify that all the local churches are built up with His resurrection life. Out of these palaces, stringed instruments make Him glad. All these verses are poetic expressions. Therefore, the stringed instruments speak of the sweet, melodious, harmonious praises. Whenever we meet in all the local churches, the first thing, the main thing, the central thing, must be the singing, the praising. The outstanding feature of Christianity today is teaching. Henceforth, we must downgrade teaching and give first place in our meetings to praising the Lord. In all the local churches praising must be the central feature, because out of the ivory palaces stringed instruments make Him glad.<p>In Psalms 42, 43, and 44 we have the appreciation of the house. Now in the house the saints experience Christ in a deeper way. Hence, following Psalms 42 to 44, we have Psalm 45. Everything concerning Christ here is deeper in our experience. We do not have adequate utterance; we can only indicate a little.<p>The first section of Psalm 45 is praise to Christ as the King. He is a King who is so precious to His people, yet One who is so mighty, so awe-inspiring to His enemies. He is riding on, He is riding back, and He is riding into His kingdom. And all of His doings are full of the fragrance of His death and resurrection. He is really worthy of our praise. We must fill all the local churches with praises to Him; then we will make Him glad.
