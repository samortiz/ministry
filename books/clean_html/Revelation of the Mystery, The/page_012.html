<h2 class=head1>SEVEN EYES, SEVEN LAMPS, AND SEVEN SPIRITS</h2><p>Now we must find out what the seven eyes are. Zechariah 4:2 says, “And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see that there is a lampstand all of gold, with its bowl on top of it and its seven lamps upon it.” Chapter three says that “upon one stone are seven eyes” (v. 9). Chapter four says that upon the lampstand are seven lamps. Can we say that the stone in chapter three is the lampstand in chapter four? Can we say that the seven eyes in chapter three are the seven lamps in chapter four? Yes, we can! We can say this because verse 10 of chapter four says, “For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven….” I believe that these seven refers not to the seven eyes but to the seven lamps, because chapter four mentions the seven lamps in verse 2 and then explains the meaning of these words in verse 10. These seven refers to the seven lamps. “They are the eyes of Jehovah.” Do you see this? The seven eyes upon the stone are the eyes of Jehovah. How could the seven eyes of Jehovah be upon the stone? This study of the Bible is truly wonderful. After reading the Bible again and again, we have discovered that the eyes of Jehovah are the seven eyes on the stone and that the seven eyes on the stone are the seven lamps on the lampstand.<p>The seven lamps in chapter four are, without a doubt, the seven eyes of God. These seven eyes cannot be another seven eyes in addition to the seven eyes in chapter three. The seven eyes in chapter three are the seven eyes on the stone, and the seven eyes in chapter four are the seven eyes of Jehovah. Therefore, this implies that the seven eyes of Jehovah are upon the stone. Who is the stone? The stone is Jehovah! The stone is Jesus, and the name Jesus means “Jehovah the Savior.” Thus, the seven eyes on the stone are the seven eyes of Jehovah because the stone is Jehovah. The stone is Jesus, who is Jehovah—the redeeming Jehovah, Jehovah who removes our iniquities, Jehovah as our Savior, and Jehovah as the Lamb of God. Therefore, His seven eyes are God’s seven eyes.<p>In Zechariah chapters three and four there are the seven eyes on the stone, the seven lamps on the lampstand, and the seven eyes of Jehovah. These verses show us that the seven eyes on the stone are the seven lamps on the lampstand, and the seven lamps on the lampstand are the seven eyes of Jehovah. Hence, these three refer to the same thing. The seven eyes on the stone, the seven lamps on the lampstand, and the eyes of Jehovah all speak of the same thing. What is this thing? The answer is in Zechariah.<p>Zechariah 4:4 says, “And I answered and spoke to the angel who spoke with me, saying, What are these, sir?” What is the significance of the one lampstand with seven lamps? Verses 5 and 6 say, “And the angel who spoke with me answered and said to me, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, sir. And he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says Jehovah of hosts.” This clearly indicates that the one lampstand with seven lamps is “My Spirit.” In other words, the lampstand with seven lamps is the Spirit of God.<p>Verse 7 says, “Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain, and he will bring forth the topstone with shouts of Grace, grace to it.” The topstone is the stone on the top of a house. This topstone is the stone with seven eyes in chapter three. Verses 8 to 10 say, “Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it; and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me to you. For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven rejoice when they see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; they are the eyes of Jehovah running to and fro on the whole earth.” The plummet in the hand is for building. Hence, all these items are for the building of God’s temple. The stone having seven eyes, the lampstand having seven lamps, and the eyes of Jehovah are just one entity. This entity is the Spirit of Jehovah. In brief, the seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God for His building.<p>Now let us come to Revelation. Revelation 4:5b says, “There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.” This verse clearly says that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God. Let us also read 5:6, which says, “And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God.” The seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God, and the seven eyes are also the seven Spirits of God. Where did the seven lamps in Revelation come from? They came from Zechariah. Where did the seven eyes in Revelation come from? They also came from Zechariah. Zechariah mentions seven eyes, and Revelation also speaks of seven eyes. Zechariah mentions seven lamps, and Revelation also speaks of seven lamps. Furthermore, in Revelation we are clearly told that the seven eyes are the seven lamps. This indicates that the seven eyes upon the stone in Zechariah 3 are the seven lamps on the lampstand. Hence, the seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God, and the seven lamps are also the seven Spirits of God. The seven eyes and the seven lamps both signify the seven Spirits of God. This absolutely corresponds with what was written in Zechariah 4:4-6. In these verses Zechariah asked, “What are these, sir?” and the angel replied that they were the Spirit of Jehovah.
