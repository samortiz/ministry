   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY THE LAW AND GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The law and grace are two great matters in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we want to know God and how He deals with man, we must know the law and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will examine the law and grace briefly here, but we must spend much time to examine these matters further.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE LAW The Nature of the Law</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good Rom 7:12, see also v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law was given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is out of God and matches God s holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, it is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It also matches God s righteousness and goodness, so it is righteous and good.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every requirement of the law on us and every demand on us is according to God s holy nature, righteousness, and goodness because the law is holy, righteous, and good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The law is spiritual Rom 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is Spirit, and the law is spiritual because the law comes out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every command of the law upon man is spiritual in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the law places demands upon man s flesh, the requirements upon man are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, these requirements cannot be fulfilled by man s flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man cannot fulfill the law or keep the commandments of the law, because he is fleshly, and the law and its commandments are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The law is good 1 Tim 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since the law is spiritual and holy, it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although man s misuse of the law is not good, the law itself is good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Entrance and Giving of the Law</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law entered in alongside Rom 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to this verse, the law entered in alongside.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the beginning the law was not part of God s original ordination for man, that is, something according to God s eternal heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It entered in alongside; that is, it was added later.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God never intended to deal with man according to the law; the law was added on the way to the fulfillment of God s desire because of the need discussed in the following sections.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Knowing this, we can avoid inaccurate views concerning the law, such as those of the Seventh-day Adventists who still live under the law even though the law is over.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The law, having come four hundred and thirty years after Gal 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Following the creation of man, man fell repeatedly, reaching the lowest point of degradation with mankind s complete rebellion against God in the construction of the tower of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God then called Abraham out of rebellious mankind and promised to bless him by dealing with him according to grace Gen 12:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Four hundred and thirty years later, God gave the law to man in order to temporarily deal with man according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows that the law was not God s original desire for man; God s original desire for man was to grace him through the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The law was added along the way as a temporary measure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The law was given through Moses John 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The law was not given until Moses brought the Israelites to Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was about two thousand five hundred years after the creation of Adam, around 1500 B.C.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Until the law...from Adam until Moses Rom 5:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before Moses there was no law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God did not use the law to deal with man from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, a period of about two thousand five hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God began to use the law to deal temporarily with man at the time of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This lasted for about one thousand five hundred years, until John the Baptist came to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The law ended with the coming of the Lord Jesus, which was the beginning of the age of grace and the end of the law Matt 11:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Means for Giving the Law</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Received the law as ordinances of angels Acts 7:53; see also Gal 3:19; Heb 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The law was given through angels.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God did not give it directly to man, because the law was not God s original desire for man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This shows that in the giving of the law to man, God did not feel as if it was a dear and sweet thing for man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If He had felt that the law was a dear and sweet thing for man, He would have given it to man Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The law was given through Moses John 1:17; see also 7:19; Exo 24:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The law was given not only through angels but also through Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, the law was established through the hand of angels and man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These two points show that the law was not given to man by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the people witnessed the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and when the people witnessed it, they trembled and stood at a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And they said to Moses, You speak with us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak with us, so we do not die Exo 20:18-19; see also 19:9-25; 20:20-21; Heb 12:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When God gave the law at Mount Sinai, He descended in fire.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This situation was truly frightening.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Israelites were frightened by the thunder, flashes of lightning, the sound of the trumpet, flames, thick clouds, and the mountain shaking.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They trembled and stood at a distance, afraid to come closer.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They even asked Moses to not let God speak to them directly so that they would not die.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This shows that the law keeps man far from God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It cannot bring man close to God.</S>
