   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN CHRIST HIS PERSON 27</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall continue to consider Christ s person in the parables of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Three Measures of Meal</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>in the Parable of Leaven</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew 13:33 the Lord Jesus says, The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This parable reveals the matter of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The three measures of meal refer to fine flour made of wheat grain, fine flour that was used in the meal offering Lev 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who served God as priests fed on the fine flour of the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The meal offering was for the satisfaction not only of the priests but of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the meal offering was food for both the priests and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The meal offering is a type of Christ in His humanity, with the fine flour signifying the fineness and evenness of Christ s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Lord appeared to Abraham, Abraham told Sarah to prepare a full meal with three measures of fine flour Gen 18:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, in the Bible three measures of meal denote a full meal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As three measures of meal, Christ, the reality of the meal offering, is food for God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fact that in Matthew 13:33 three measures of meal have been leavened by the woman indicates that everything related to Christ has been leavened by this evil woman.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Leaven in the Scriptures signifies evil things 1 Cor 5:6, 8 and evil doctrines Matt 16:6, 11-12 , and the woman signifies the apostate Catholic Church, which has mixed the teachings concerning Christ with pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters until the whole was leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is absolutely against the Scripture, which strongly forbids putting leaven into the meal offering Lev 2:4-5, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church, as the practicality of the kingdom of the heavens, should have only Christ, the unleavened fine flour, as its content.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>12.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Man in the Parable</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>of a Treasure Hidden in the Field</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Matthew 13:44 says, The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and in his joy goes and sells all, whatever he has, and buys that field.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The treasure signifies the kingdom with the true Israel, God s peculiar treasure Exo 19:5; Psa 135:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The field is the earth, which signifies the world created by God for His kingdom Gen 1:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the treasure hidden in the field signifies the kingdom hidden in the God-created world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is the man who found the treasure and then hid it, and in His joy sold all and bought the field.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ found the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 4:12 to 12:23, hid it in 12:24 to 13:43, and in His joy went to the cross in 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; and 26:1 to 27:52 to sell all He had and buy that field to redeem the created and lost earth for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ first found the treasure when He came out to minister, declaring, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near Matt 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Jews rejection of the Lord reached its peak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He forsook them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From that time onward, He hid the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then He went to the cross to buy not only the treasure but also the field and thereby redeem the earth created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He redeemed the whole earth for the sake of the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ went to the cross to redeem the God-created earth because within the earth there was the kingdom, the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order for Him to have the kingdom on earth, Christ had to redeem the earth because it had been polluted and damaged by Satan s rebellion and man s sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord sold all that He had and bought the earth; that is, He sacrificed all He had on the cross to redeem the earth for the treasure of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No doubt this kingdom is realized in the church life, but its manifestation is related to the redeemed nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During the millennium the earth will become the kingdom of Christ Rev 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time the nation of Israel will be the center of Christ s kingdom.</S>
