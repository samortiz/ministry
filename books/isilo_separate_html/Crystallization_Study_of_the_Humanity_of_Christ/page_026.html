Taking Care of the Churches<br>as the Lampstands in His Humanity</H2><P>Revelation 1:11-13 shows that Christ as the Son of Man is taking care of the churches as the lampstands in His humanity. As the High Priest He is dressing the churches as the lampstands to cherish them, to make them happy, bright, and shining. He is also caring for the churches with His divinity as the energy motivated by His love signified by the golden girdle on His breast.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Coming Back in His Humanity</H2><P>Christ will come back as the Son of Man (Matt. 10:23). He will destroy the whole earth as the flood did in Noah's days and as the fire and brimstone did at Lot's time (Matt. 24:37-39; Luke 17:26-30) and take away His believers who are watching and ready for His coming secretly (Matt. 24:40-44; Luke 12:40; 21:36). His coming back has two parts: one part is the secret part, and the other is the open part. The watchful ones, the ready ones, will see Him as the morning star and be taken by Him in the early part of His secret coming back (Rev. 2:28). Later, He will openly come back to the earth as the sun of righteousness (Mal. 4:2). Today as the Son of Man He is expecting to find His believers in faith (Luke 18:8). When the Son of Man comes back, He will reap His harvest openly (Rev. 14:14-16). He also will send His angels to collect out of His kingdom all the tares and cast them into the lake of fire (Matt. 13:41-42). All of the false believers, the tares, damage God's economy. They will be cast into the lake of fire when Christ comes back in His humanity.</P><P>Christ as the Son of Man will return in the glory of His Father with His angels in His kingdom (Matt. 16:27-28; 25:31; Mark 8:38b; Luke 9:26b). He will be ashamed of the people who were ashamed of Him and His words in this adulterous and sinful generation (Mark 8:38a; Luke 9:26a). When He comes back openly, He will be like the lightning coming forth from the east and shining to the west (Matt. 24:27; Luke 17:24). Lightning may be considered as being concealed in a cloud, waiting for an opportunity to flash forth. In a similar way, Christ will be clothed with a cloud (Rev. 10:1) in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear, like a flash of lightning striking the earth. This implies also that the Lord is like electricity. He will appear in heaven on the clouds with power and great glory to be seen by all the mourning tribes of the earth (Matt. 24:30; 26:64b; Mark 13:26; 14:62b; Luke 21:27). At that time they will see and receive Christ, and the whole family of Israel will be saved.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
