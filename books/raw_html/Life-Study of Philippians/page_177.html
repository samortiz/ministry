	<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">A LIFE FULL OF FORBEARANCE<br />BUT WITHOUT ANXIETY</h1><h1 class="msg">(4)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 4:4-7, 10-13</h1><p>In the foregoing message we emphasized the need of forbearance in our married life, family life, and church life. For the building up of the church, the elders and all the saints need to exercise forbearance. Likewise, for a pleasant married life and an excellent family life we need to be forbearing. I hope that all the saints with children will be deeply impressed with the need to exercise forbearance in their daily living at home.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF FORBEARANCE</h2><p>The Greek word rendered <i>forbearance</i> in 4:5 is composed of two words: <i>epi,</i> a preposition which means unto, and <i>eikos,</i> which means seemly, fitting, or suitable. When the preposition <i>epi</i> is added to other Greek words as a prefix, it often bears the meaning of full or extensive. Consider, for example, the word <i>epignosis</i> used in 2 Timothy 2:25. In this verse Paul speaks of &ldquo;the full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo; Hence, <i>epi</i> added to <i>gnosis</i> gives a word which means full knowledge. The use of this preposition as a component of the Greek word for &ldquo;forbearance&rdquo; in 4:5 indicates that the meaning of this word is to be fully reasonable, or fitting or suitable to the fullest extent. We need to have a full and extensive reasonableness and considerateness. Furthermore, we need to act in a way that is fitting and suitable to the fullest extent. All these meanings are included in the Greek word used by Paul in 4:5.</p><p>The Greek word rendered <i>forbearance</i> in 4:5 is not actually a noun; it is an adjective used as a noun with a definite article. This use of an adjective as a noun serves to emphasize the meaning of the word. For example, in 1 Timothy 6:17 Paul says, &ldquo;Charge those who are rich in the present age not to be high-minded.&rdquo; This is more emphatic than saying, &ldquo;Charge the rich man not to be high-minded.&rdquo; In 4:5 Paul deliberately uses an adjective as a noun in order to place special emphasis on forbearance.</p><h2 class="head1">A RICH SUPPLY</h2><p>In the previous message we pointed out that forbearance requires understanding, wisdom, patience, and many other virtues. If we would be forbearing, we need to be merciful, kind, and compassionate. Furthermore, to forbear definitely requires a certain ability in a number of areas. We need the ability to understand, to be patient, to help others, and to afford them the necessary supply. In His forbearance toward us, God certainly has given us a rich supply.</p><p>God forbears with fallen man for a purpose. His purpose in showing forbearance is to accomplish His economy. If God did not afford man the adequate supply and show forbearance to man, there would be no way for God to fulfill His purpose of accomplishing His economy.</p><h2 class="head1">REJOICING IN THE LORD</h2><p>We have seen that forbearance requires maturity and also satisfaction and contentment. Now we need to see that forbearance is also related to rejoicing in the Lord. In 4:4 Paul says, &ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.&rdquo; Immediately after this he says, &ldquo;Let your forbearance be known to all men.&rdquo; If we do not rejoice in the Lord, we shall not be able to forbear. If we would make known our forbearance, we need to be happy and joyful in the Lord. Those who are sad or sorrowful cannot have forbearance. Instead, they find it easy to be upset, to complain, or to lose their temper. Forbearance in 4:5 is the issue, the result, of rejoicing in the Lord, mentioned in verse 4. From experience we know that rejoicing and forbearing go together.</p>
