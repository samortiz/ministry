   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHILDREN S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I returned to Taiwan in 1966 and in 1967, there were four thousand children in the children s meetings, and I told the brothers to set a goal of having ten thousand children in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I also asked the brothers to perfect the junior high and high school brothers and sisters to assist in teaching the children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These children would be gospel seeds in junior high school, they would be gospel seeds in high school, and they would be gospel seeds in college.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They would be seeds the entire time that they are in school.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose the youngest child in the children s work was six years old in 1967.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He would now be twenty-three.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we had had ten thousand children in the children s work, there would be at least five thousand saints in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These calculations show that our business has failed; we have wasted much time and effort.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though we have been busy in the church life, there are not more than three thousand five hundred saints in the meetings of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we had continued the children s work from 1967 until now, the children who were six years old in 1967 would now be twenty-three, and the ones who were twelve would be twenty-nine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if only half of the children came into the church life, we would have four to five thousand saints meeting with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At present our children s meetings have less than one thousand children.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have about three thousand five hundred saints in the meetings, and of these numbers there are at least one thousand families.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If every family has one child, there should be at least one thousand children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that for the past seventeen years we have not been able to cultivate even our own children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This situation is improper and abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have been in the Lord s work for more than half a century.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During this time I have studied our situation and the situation of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Catholic Church has neither gospel campaigns nor great evangelists, and they never advertise.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, every year they gain more than one million converts from among their own children.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Seventeen years ago I exhorted you to work until we had ten thousand children.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This would not have been difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I also explained that the children s meetings did not have to be in the meeting halls; they could be held in the homes of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They could also be held on any day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This way we could gain the children in our neighborhood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, I said that we should perfect the young brothers and sisters in junior high, high school, and college to coordinate as teachers in the children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE CAMPUS WORK</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1965 there were many students in our gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most of them were secondary school students, who came in their uniforms.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time there were more than one hundred high schools, technical institutes, and universities in the city of Taipei, and some brothers and sisters were in every school.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the peak of the campus work at National Taiwan University, we had more than three hundred brothers and sisters on campus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows that we had many brothers and sisters who were either students or teachers in the high schools, technical institutes, and universities.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today, however, we have very few students at National Taiwan University, and we barely have a gospel work there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, our work among the young people and the students is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have not been successful in the children s work, nor have we been successful in the campus work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have been busy, but instead of our numbers increasing, they have decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This should cause us to be concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE SPREAD OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must wake up, be sober, and make some changes; otherwise, our capital, our family inheritance, will gradually diminish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to our statistics, from 1949 to 1956 our numbers increased one hundredfold; we increased from five hundred saints to fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers and sisters who were saved during those years worked in government agencies, hospitals, and businesses; some were even government officials.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This shows how widespread our gospel work was.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The books we publish are welcomed everywhere; there are seeking ones in Asia, India, and even Burma.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We recently learned that a meeting has been raised up in Burma, and that the saints there are in contact with the saints in Thailand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The saints in Burma even wrote us letters asking for books.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moreover, a brother from Burma sent us a letter of fellowship, in fluent English, in which he wrote that they have around twenty Christian meetings in Burma.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The saints there have asked for permission to translate all the Life-study messages into Burmese.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We received another letter, probably from a British missionary in Burma, who appreciated our Life-study messages and asked us for permission to translate them for use with their Bible studies.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These letters prove that Burma is open.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>India is also open.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is a high school teacher in southern India, who contacted us while he was studying in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He plans to return to India and begin the church life there after attending the up-coming winter training.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A month ago some believers in a small country called Zimbabwe in Africa wrote us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In their letter they said that they had started meeting, and they asked us for books.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We thank the Lord that the publications are going out, but we feel that this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The truth must go out in more than a fragmentary, scattered way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Any truly firm and solid work cannot be done in a scattered way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Under God s sovereignty America has passed a law that relaxes the restrictions on Chinese immigration, and many Chinese have immigrated to America.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many of the saints from Taiwan have also immigrated to America.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have been in America for more than twenty years, and I have not promoted a Chinese-speaking work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But last year we felt to begin a Chinese-speaking work because so many brothers and sisters have immigrated to America.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the brothers and sisters who have immigrated to America have relatives, friends, and possessions there.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we contact them, we are welcomed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have received much blessing in this area.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>CALLING YOUNG WORKING SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>TO BE PERFECTED</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is now more convenient to preach the gospel in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thirty years ago the average level of education in Taiwan was not high, neither was there economic stability, and transportation and communication were not well developed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today Taiwan is densely populated, and people are concentrated in small areas.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Moreover, people have a high level of education, there are economic resources, transportation is convenient, and public security is good.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We can say that it is an opportune time to preach the gospel in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, I hope that two hundred of the two thousand young working saints in Taipei will receive a burden to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have the essential Spirit within us, and we have the economical Spirit upon us; we have the Spirit within and without for our move.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now we must produce two hundred young working saints who are willing to be trained and be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we had continued our initial practice, we would now have over thirty thousand saints actively meeting with us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is a projection based not on idealism but on statistics.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we say Amen to this word and if we want the church in Taipei to have thirty thousand saints, we need to recover the seventeen thousand saints who do not meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The elders must give this thorough consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am speaking these words with an intimate spirit, because we are one family.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This fellowship concerns the members of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should consider this matter and change; otherwise, we will waste our family inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is not an individual matter; it is a corporate matter.</S>
