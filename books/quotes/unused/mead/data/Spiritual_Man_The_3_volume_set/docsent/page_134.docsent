   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When a believer has condemned his flesh and walks according to the spirit, he can truly receive the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Otherwise, he wants his flesh to receive spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the flesh does not pass through death, the spirit has no possibility of receiving power, because when the power of the flesh remains, the flesh still reigns and the spirit is oppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The power of the Holy Spirit only descends upon a spirit which is full of the Holy Spirit, because only then is there a possibility for the power of the Holy Spirit to flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the spirit is full, the power that comes in will overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, on the one hand, the believer must die to the old creation, and on the other hand, he must learn how to walk together with the Holy Spirit in his living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then he can receive power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every believer must seek for the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Understanding in the mind is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Holy Spirit must surround his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether his work is effective depends on whether or not the believer has the experience of being baptized in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit needs an outlet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What a pity that He cannot find an outlet in many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some are hindered by sin, some are proud, some are cold, some are filled with their own opinion, and some trust in the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The power of the Holy Spirit has no place to exude!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Besides the Holy Spirit, we still have too many sources!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the matter of seeking the power of the Holy Spirit, we must keep our mind clear and our will active.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This guards against the counterfeit of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, we must let God remove from our lives, one by one, everything that belongs to sin and everything that is unrighteous and doubtful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must consecrate our whole being to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Receive the promise of the Spirit through faith" Gal 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rest in God and consider that God will do according to His Word in His own time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not forget this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If God delays, we must allow His light to examine our own living even more.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If God allows us to have some feeling when we receive the power, we may rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If He does not, we still should believe that He has done it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just by looking at a believer's experience, we can tell whether or not he has received power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whoever has received power will develop a very keen awareness of the senses of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He will receive eloquence albeit not worldly to witness for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His work will be effective and bear everlasting fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Power is the basic condition for spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After a believer receives the power of the Holy Spirit, he will have a clear feeling concerning the senses of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the work of God, a believer must keep his spirit free to allow the Holy Spirit to flow out His life after he receives power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To keep the spirit free is to keep the spirit always in the condition wherein the Holy Spirit can work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, God may command a believer to lead a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The spirit of this believer needs to be free.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He should not come into the meeting with many burdens or loads still in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will cause the whole meeting to have a burden and become "hardened" and unbreakable.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The one who leads the meeting must not come to the meeting with his own burden, hoping that the congregation will function or assist him to be free of his burden.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Depending on the response of the congregation to free the leader of the meeting from his spiritual burden will result in failure.</S>
