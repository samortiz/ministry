   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING AN EARNEST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us look at verse 14: "Who is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul told us in verse 13 that the Holy Spirit has sealed us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, this indicates that we belong to God and, second, it makes us like God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He told us in verse 14 that the Holy Spirit is like a pledge or what we commonly know as a deposit .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul told us not only that the Holy Spirit has sealed us, but also that the Holy Spirit was given as a pledge, a deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the original language, deposit means an actual deposit and a sample.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Deposit</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is a "deposit"?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose I am buying a piece of land for two thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I pay one hundred dollars in advance as a deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the seller receives one hundred dollars first, and I give him the balance later.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I only pay him a portion at first, while I must pay the balance later.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I am faithful, I will pay him the balance of one thousand nine hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God does likewise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He gives us the Holy Spirit as a pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that He gives to us part of the heavenly blessing first as a guarantee that He will give us all the heavenly inheritance later.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God puts Himself in a legally unchangeable position.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has paid the deposit and must therefore pay the whole later.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's Holy Spirit is the guarantee of His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible says that we, the believers, will receive much in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet, how do we know He will carry out His word?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know it through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God makes the Holy Spirit a deposit and proves to us that none of His promise will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since God has given us the Holy Spirit as a "deposit," He is saying to us through the Holy Spirit that all of His will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once He does this, it becomes impossible for Him to change.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is there anyone in the world who has paid a deposit and will not pay the rest unless he is dishonest?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is faithful and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once He pays the deposit, He will surely pay the balance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Mr. Philip Mauro said, "What is the deposit like? It is just like an engagement ring." It means that now your fianc gives you a small part, and that he will give you all that he has on the wedding day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, God gives us the Holy Spirit as a "deposit" indicating that all the riches in the heavens will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. Sample</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>People in ancient times had another custom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the time of the sale of a piece of land, not only did the buyer pay some money as a deposit to the seller, but the seller also gave some of the soil as a sample to the buyer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This meant that the soil one received on that day would be the same as the soil he would receive in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has given us the Holy Spirit not only as a deposit but also as a sample so that we can enjoy a foretaste of the heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By this, we know that what is given to us by God today will be the same in nature as what He will give to us in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If silver is given today, silver will be given in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If gold is given today, gold will be given in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God gives us the Holy Spirit today in order that we can have a foretaste of the heavenly things on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brothers and sisters, have you ever tasted the heavenly things?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible tells us that Paul heard unspeakable words and tasted heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We fellowship with God, and we also fellowship with one another in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Holy Spirit is the means through which we fellowship with God and by which we receive the heavenly joy and the bestowing of the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we come to the Lord, worship Him, or fellowship with one another, do we not feel the Lord's love and joy?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the foretaste of the heavenly things!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once a brother talked about the Lord's love with me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He said, "When the Lord's love comes upon me, I cannot sit still.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I want to go out and run for a while."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What we taste today is good and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet in the future it will be better and richer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes we feel the Lord's love and joy burning within us like a fire.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet what we taste today is still only a little.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There will be much more in the future!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What we taste today is just a little a little today, a little tomorrow, and a little the day after.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What we will taste in the future is not just this little.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We cannot imagine how good it will be.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It will be so good that we will say, "Even eternity is too short!"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must remember that there are two meanings to the Holy Spirit being a deposit from God to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The first is that God gives us a part today and that He will give us the whole in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The other is that what God gives us today, He will give us in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the spies of Israel cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes from the brook of Eshcol, and two carried it, they told Moses, "We came to the land to which you sent us; and surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit" Num 13:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This cluster of grapes indicated the nature of the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Surely it flowed with milk and honey!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Holy Spirit dwelling in us is also like this cluster of grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The taste today is just like what the heavenly taste will be in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We thank and praise God that He has given us the Holy Spirit, not only as our deposit, guaranteeing that He will give us the whole, but as a foretaste of the heavenly things.</S>
