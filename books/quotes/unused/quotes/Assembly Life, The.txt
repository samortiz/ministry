Although they have given up things that should not be in the church, they have not fully lived out the proper living of the Body of Christ
They have dealt with negative things in a thorough way, but they are not thorough with the positive things yet
God does not want His children to move freely on earth; He rules over His church through the authority He establishes in the church
It is right for us to depart from human organizations, but it is wrong for us to overturn the authority that God has established
Many people think that as long as they leave the improper fellowship, the denominations, they have been perfected
It shows us the common knowledge a brother or a sister should have concerning various kinds of meetings in a local assembly
Although spiritual things cannot be taught, there must be proper teachings before there can be a proper living
If this is not our practice, the fellowship among all the assemblies will not be balanced, and confusion will result
May God bless this book so that it becomes the light of life to God's children everywhere, not ordinances in letters
Although this meeting is in the nature of a Bible study we cannot read all the scriptural references because of the limitation of time
During the past conference, we saw that before times eternal, God had a will and a foreordained plan of His own
Today some lay much stress on preaching the gospel, and by so doing they replace the church with gospel preaching
The reason is because from eternity past God's emphasis was the church, but man's emphasis in this age is missions
Satan's subtle method is to utilize works used by God and substitute them for the church, which God in His eternal will intends to establish
Many Christians may say, 'We have not established mission boards, humanistic societies, Sunday schools, schools, and hospitals'
You have been a Christian for these many years, but how much time have you spent considering what God is after?
Or has your primary attention been paid to how to pray, how to overcome sin, how to help sinners be saved, and how to study the Bible well?
The Lord was raised from the dead to be far above all rule and authority, and He is above all to be Head over all things to the church
It is for the building up of the church that God has given us apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers
May the Lord have mercy on us and deliver us from our limited vision into His goal and into what He emphasizes in the Scriptures
We come together every Lords Day morning and afternoon to listen to messages and we come together every Lords Day evening to break the bread
Or should we pursue being good brothers or good sisters by trying to render help to the meeting and the church?
As to the life of Christ and the Body of Christ, we may speak more about them in the future when the opportunity arises
Before the New Jerusalem descends from heaven, God's goal is to have a miniature of the New Jerusalem in every city
The local church is the miniature of the magnificent church of God, a small-scale model expressing the New Jerusalem
Rather, we should go a step further and ask what we should do in order to be fitly framed together with other brothers and sisters
Many Christians today are very good, and others are extremely shining and beautiful, but they cannot be framed together
If you are a stone which leaves cracks between you and the other stones, you are not of much use in the house of God
Everything outside of the assembly life, such as the brothers' relationship with one another, mutual forgiveness, etc
All other points concerning our corporate life together will be covered in future messages on the Lord's Day morning and afternoon
In the beginning, after the universe was created, God appointed a cherubim as the archangel to rule over everything
God was over everything, and He ruled over the spirit-endowed animals and over all things through the archangel, the cherubim
The archangel attempted to overturn God's authority because he desired to uplift himself to become equal with God
God desires that man submit to authority because the authorities are not only appointed by God, but they also represent God
If anyone does these things, he is not just overturning those he directly opposes, he is overturning God's authority
When the high priest's accusations became too much, Paul said, 'God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall'
He feels that he is limited and controlled by men, and he thinks that by leaving the denominations, he can be a free evangelist
The authority of apostles is for overseeing all the churches, while the authority of elders is for overseeing each respective local church
In order to manifest His authority in the church, God appoints elders in each of the local churches to represent His authority
Before a meeting is properly established as an assembly, it is still feeble in its walk, and there is the need for others to support it
If we are not careful, and if we refuse to submit to authority, we are not following Christ but following Antichrist instead
If God has placed a certain person in a certain position and has charged us to submit to him, we should submit accordingly
If the title of an elder is conferred, we would have to ask where are the apostles who appointed these elders?
There are a group of people who are doing the work of the apostles, such as preaching the gospel and establishing churches
Today, God is working through this group of people in the same way that He was working through the apostles in the early days
They must be able to rule themselves and manage their own family, and they must know how to deal with outsiders
In 1 Timothy and Titus, the words concerning an elder not being one who drinks excessively, or who strikes others, etc
All those who have had concubines cannot be an elder because this means that such a person cannot control himself
In dealing with his own wife and children, God puts him to the test to see if he can deal with the brothers and sisters
If men can find something good to say about a person and give good marks to him, then he surely must be somewhat good
If a greedy, self-centered, and defiled son of Adam can call a Christian a good man, then the Christian surely must be good
Since the work of an elder is related to the church and not to a worldly organization, he needs to have much assurance in God's truth
If they do not have much assurance in the truth, they will think that all the brothers are equally good and that everyone can preach
He should be able to judge the kind of teachings that should be introduced to the church and the kind of teachings that should be rejected
When these things happen, the responsible brothers or those who are doing the work of an elder should step forward to deal with such matters
No brother can stand up in the meeting at will to express his opinion concerning what to believe and what not to believe
The place God has assigned for the sisters is to be under someone's ruling; they do not have a place in ruling over others
If the brothers think that this is proper, they will not stop it and will allow the sisters to meet accordingly
Those who do not have the gift of teaching desire to speak many times; it seems as if they are addicted to preaching
When the elders notice that men who are not suitable to conduct Bible study or to preach are trying to do these things they should stop them
The brothers have to pay attention to this matter, learn to submit to authority, and not do things that the elders have not endorsed
Whether the Lord's Day meeting should be held in the morning or in the afternoon is a matter to be decided by the elders
The elders have to learn to serve properly and exercise their authority properly, while the brothers have to learn to submit
After hearing about the authority of the elders, are we not afraid that the elders may misuse their authority?
If you are in Christ, understand God's heart, and are able to tell others about God's heart, you are the true authority
On the other hand, the elders themselves should realize that they have no authority in themselves and that they are there merely as patterns
The apostles and those whom they have specifically assigned should be responsible for handling such accusations
If you are a teacher, you can teach the Bible in Shanghai and also teach the Bible in northern Kiangsu, Nanking, or Tsinan
If you are an evangelist, you can preach the gospel in Shanghai, and you can preach the gospel in northern Kiangsu, Nanking, or Tientsin
If you move to Nanking, you will still be a concrete worker by profession, but you may not be able to be a foreman anymore
The mistake most easily committed is that when an elder in one locality moves to another locality, he asserts his own opinion there as well
Do not think that just because things are done one way in northern Kiangsu, it has to be done the same way in Shanghai
If a Jew wanted to see God, he had to pass through the hand of the priests; there was no way for him to go directly to God
The pastors are the intermediary class, who replace the believers and monopolize all the spiritual matters that belong to the members
There is no need of an intermediary like the ones in Judaism, Catholicism, or Protestantism to help us draw near to God
Today we are not like the high priests in the Old Testament, who could go into the Holy of Holies only once a year
Whether or not a person has the gift of a pastor, we should not make him a priest and bring in a disguised priestly system
They may think that since they have left the denominations, they can be lawless and free, doing anything they want
Submitting to man is submitting to God's authority, and submitting to the brothers is submitting to God's authority
Do not think that by leaving the denominations, we can become free and lawless and that no one can rule over us
We are giving up the denominations, which are not found in the Bible; we are not giving up the elders, which are found in the Bible
There are brothers in the denominations; we cannot say that we are giving up the brothers just because we have given up the denominations
There is no difference between a worker with an occupation and a worker without an occupation; there is no distinction of class
Those who are gifted can hold a job, and they can also do their work, as long as their job does not interfere with their work
The reason Christians pay too much attention to those who live by faith is that the faith of Christians has become degraded
In the Bible the elders are brothers, the gifted ones are brothers, and those who do not have any gift are brothers also
Among the brothers, there are only distinctions between gifts and positions; there is no distinction between having and not having a job
If a pastor in a denomination, on the one hand, serves as a pastor and, on the other hand, holds a job, others will misunderstand him
Pastoring or shepherding is a gift and is for the building up of the whole church; it is a gift that God has given to the whole church
As far as their gifts are concerned, it is possible that among those who are ordained by men, some have the gift of pastoring
They should be able to lead others to grow step by step, discuss and study the Bible with others, and pray with others
On the one hand, a woman covers her head in Christ and, on the other hand, she covers her head through the man
The covering on a woman's head symbolizes her submission under the authority of the brothers and her not acting in an independent way
If a wife sits in the place of a husband and becomes the husband's head in a family, how can that family stand?
The virtuous woman recorded in Proverbs labors, works, and hopes that her husband receives the glory in the gate of the city
If they want to testify or preach the gospel to individual men or to groups of men, they should do it in a covered position
Why do we have to mention it now and stir up misunderstandings that we have become a denomination by having elders?
Question: Among us, we may have men who resemble the elders, but they do not have the official title of an elder
If others were to ask him what this was, he would say that it was not the temple: rather, it was only a tent on the ground of the temple
We are not the church in Shanghai, but we are meeting in a way that maintains and upholds the church in Shanghai
Even though we are not the temple, we are a miniature of the temple, and we are here to express the life of the temple
Although the temple was no longer the same as the first one the ground of the temple was the same and the principles of the temple remained
From this we see that although the people were divided outwardly, the principle of service to God should not be lost
If a man misuses his gifts, he is using them according to his human way or for his own glory, as the Corinthians did
It was fortunate that Moses did not know, for had he known that his face was shining, the shining would have gone away
Question If misusing or burying the gifts will bring Gods judgment is it better that we do not ask for the gifts lest we fall into judgment
If a believer has never been dealt with, it is better that he does not ask for gifts lest he fail in the future judgment
Answer: In the parable of the talents in Matthew 25, there are three kinds of gifts-five talents, two talents, and one talent
You may find out that although they have the gifts, they do not want to stand on the ground that God wants them to stand on
We must never think that, as long as we have a fine and thriving work and others love to listen to us, we are right
If we think that He will not reckon with us until many years afterward, we may use our gifts in a careless way
As to the gifts that are for the growth of a local church, we have those mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 and Romans 12
Not every believer has the gifts of Ephesians 4, but they may have one of the gifts mentioned in Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12
Those who aspire to be the authority are not qualified to be the authority; authority can never be placed in their hand
Timothy 3 says that a novice should not be an overseer lest he become proud and fall into the snare of the devil
The Lord is telling these ones not to aspire to be an elder lest they fall into the devil's snare through their pride
God tells those who volunteer to be elders that they are not worthy and encourages those who are worthy but withdrawn to be elders
We must never consider the boasting of the flesh as a kind of courage and the withdrawing of the flesh as a kind of humility
When we consider our own virtues, we become proud; when we consider our own weaknesses and failures, we dare not do anything and withdraw
Question Do the apostles prophets evangelists shepherds and teachers in Ephesians 4 refer to people or do they refer to things or titles
Ephesians 4 says that God gives some apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers; these are five kinds of people
All five kinds of people in Ephesians 4 are gifts given by God to the church, and they are for the whole church
Corinthians 12 mentions the various gifts that God gives to individual believers; the gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 are for the local churches
The gift which was released through Paul has benefited men of all times and places; his work did not pass away; it remains even until today
In the church there should not only be responsible ones like the elders, but the church should also have serving ones like the deacons
The ones who make decisions, manage the church, make proposals, oversee, and observe from top to bottom are the elders
God needs the elders to be the doorkeepers, and He needs the deacons to work and run errands for the believers
When Acts mentions Philip, it says that he was one of the seven; it does not say that he was one of the seven deacons
Answer: The only thing that can be done is for these few brothers to function as elders and deacons at the same time
They must first be sent to handle affairs a few times, before one can decide if they are qualified to be a deacon
There should at least be one brother who can take responsibility before the bread-breaking meeting is initiated
The church that we are in is the same church that the apostle John, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and all regenerated persons are in
Since Ephesians mentions one Body one Spirit one hope one Lord one faith one baptism and one God why does the Bible mention churches also
In each locality there may be as many as three to five thousand believers or there may be as few as two or three as described in Matthew 18
Do not think that we have one bread in Wen-teh Lane and another bread in Gordon Lane, and yet another in Peking or Changchun
Although brothers can break bread in Changchun, Peking, Hangchow, or Nan-shu-chow, there is only one bread before God
The bread that is broken in every place and the Body of Christ that it represents is the same bread and same Body of Christ in every place
These scattered churches in the cities and villages are called the churches in those cities or the churches in those villages
Whether it be the meeting in Bao-shan, Hangchow, Soo-chia-tsui, or anywhere else, all these meetings represent the Body of Christ
While you are sitting in a meeting, you should not see only the brothers and sisters next to you but the whole Body of Christ
Just as these associations represent China in Southeast Asia, we represent the church in our respective localities
Since this is the case, we can see how intimately related the conduct of an individual church is to the conduct of the Body of Christ
For this reason, we have to be related to other local churches and the brothers and sisters in the other localities
When we receive a brother in Hangchow, we are receiving him on behalf of the churches in Tientsin, Shanghai, Soo-chow, and other places
By the same token, if a matter cannot pass the unanimous approval of the whole church, it is not a move of the Body but an individual move
When a brother goes to another locality to break bread, the brothers in the locality should not examine him further
If Shanghai recognizes a certain person as having the ability to preach the gospel, Peking should recognize the same thing
Although offices may change through change of location, gifts do not change through moving to a different location
If he recognized such a one as a co-worker, he would be bringing him into the work of his other co-workers as well
When he was in Kuling, a few Western brothers often came to meet with him, and they had fellowship one with another
Since they had fellowship with Brother Yu in Kuling why would they not fellowship with those who have fellowship with Brother Yu in Shanghai
They should not just fellowship with Brother Yu and refuse to fellowship with those who have fellowship with Brother Yu
You may come to break bread because you think that this place is better than other places and that you can hear good messages here
In Peking there may be another place with a famous speaker, who is eloquent but who does not fellowship with us
When you arrive in Peking, you may wonder in your heart whether you should meet with the very weak brothers or listen to the famous speaker
In the meetings, we have the greatest blessings, but we also bear the greatest responsibilities and have the greatest restrictions
After we have believed in the Lord, not only are we saved, but we also should act as brothers by standing in the position of a brother
Many people only see their own sins; they only know that when they believe in the Lord, their sins are forgiven, and they are saved
If a brother wants to go to a certain place, he should first try to find the brothers who are in fellowship with us
Do not move to a place for four or five months without looking for the place to meet and without letting others know where you are
Before you leave your own locality, do not neglect to ask the elders to write a letter of recommendation for you
If all of us take care of the mutual fellowship and act according to the Scriptures, our fellowship will become very precious
Our responsibility is to care for the whole Body of Christ, not only for the things related to the local assembly
The Presbyterians only know the things related to Presbyterians, while the Methodists only know the things related to Methodists
Of all the books of the Bible, 1 Corinthians is the clearest in dealing with the affairs concerning the church
In other words, all the churches should take the same way; it should not be different from one church to another
A sister cannot be free of her head covering in the meeting in Peking while covering her head in the meeting in Shanghai
In 1 Corinthians 14 it is said that women should not open their mouths in the meetings, 'as in all the churches of the saints'
The apostle said, 'And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit'
Again he said, 'For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus'
If we only care for the churches in China and cut off the churches in other countries, we are not walking according to God's will
It is a different matter for a person to be unable to find an assembly that is meeting on the ground of the church
If they do not achieve their goal, they will go to another place like a village or an island and lead some people to salvation
Little do they realize however that they will become a sect by doing this they are not an assembly that stands on the ground of the church
As mentioned in the Bible, they are actually a sect because their fellowship is limited to only the one or two hundred people among them
It is a sect because Presbyterians can fellowship only with the Presbyterians in Nanking, Soochow, England, or America
In considering whether an assembly is a sect or not, it is not enough to see whether its practice is scriptural
The main question does not involve whether or not the practice of an assembly is scriptural but whether the assembly itself is a sect
If an assembly is not of the Body of Christ nor for the Body of Christ, it should be forsaken because it is a sect
If we want to serve God properly, we must learn how to not disobey God's commands and how to be restricted by the brothers and sisters
The standard of our conduct is not according to the approval of the majority but according to the decision of the brothers in oneness
The principle of the Open Brethren is to care only for their own local assemblies, while ignoring the assemblies in other places
In some localities, the brothers are divided into several assemblies, and no assembly communicates with another assembly
Not only do the assemblies which stand on the ground of the church practice this way; even the denominations practice this way
All those who are excommunicated by the Presbyterians in Shanghai are excommunicated by the Presbyterians in Nanking
Shanghai cannot overturn or interfere with the decisions of Tsinan, and Tsinan cannot overturn or interfere with the decisions of Shanghai
In making decisions, both Shanghai and Tsinan have to consider how their decisions will affect the other assemblies
Suppose the assembly in Tsinan receives an unsaved person by mistake, and he is recommended to the assembly in Shanghai
If the assembly in Shanghai does not agree with this matter, the assembly in Tsinan cannot receive that brother
Question: Suppose a brother has a letter of recommendation from the church in Tsinan, and he comes to meet with the assembly in Shanghai
Later, if he is excommunicated by the assembly in Shanghai, should the brothers in Tsinan be consulted before he is excommunicated?
Answer: When the letter of recommendation is received, we should receive this person according to the letter of recommendation
If we are not sure that the table in Hardoon Road is right, we should not come here tomorrow for the bread-breaking meeting
They are one of the seven or eight groups of Exclusive Brethren, and these seven or eight groups do not even receive one another
If a meeting is raised up in one place, and another meeting is raised up in the same place, we cannot go to both places
If we do not have the same fellowship, we cannot go to both places even when the form of the meetings in the two places is the same
The Brethren say that they cannot receive anyone to their bread-breaking meeting who has not left the denominations
We have to make one thing clear: when you go to hear them, there is a limitation to your communication with them
If the goal of their works is not up to the standard of God's goal, their works are not God's work according to the biblical standard
Everything that comes short of this, that is, everything that endeavors for less than this goal, is not God's work
If one only does these works and does not come up to the standard of the local church, he has not come up to the standard of God's goal
God's work in the book of Acts was nothing less than the local church; it never came short of this and never fell short of this goal
They cling tenaciously to their own 'Bible study,' yet they want to break bread with us and even preach in our bread-breaking meeting
Answer: If there is an exclusive Bible study meeting, it is not being conducted according to the principle of the church
If people such as those you have just described want to come and break bread with us, we should be willing and happy to receive them
We should not refuse to receive a believer in the denominations; we should merely receive the believer himself
If anyone is not clear concerning the truth of the church, we can have fellowship with him only in life, but not in the work
Since he still has fellowship with the denominations, we do not know what he would speak if we allowed him to preach
As to the sending of a cable, it can be done if it is for the sake of informing the brothers or for understanding the brothers' mind
Answer: This is not just a hypothetical question you may face in Sinkiang; it is a problem we face right here in Shanghai
If anyone wants to break bread with us yet at the same time partake of the Holy Communion in the denominations we cannot excommunicate him
If he would not listen to our exhortation we have to act according to Titus 310 A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse
Since you are in Suchow often, the brothers in Shanghai cannot consult with you about things concerning the assembly in Shanghai
Answer: Please notice that the first and second points are our conditions for receiving a person to the Lord's table
If a Japanese comes to our midst and breaks bread with us, we should acknowledge him as our dear brother just like all other brothers
We should not care for the distinction that exists between men but only for our relationship in the Body of Christ
If one who does not discern the Body comes to break bread with us, we can ask whether he is willing to discern the Body
We have to let him know that if he does not discern the Body, he is eating judgment to himself and that it will be to his loss
The meaning of anointing with oil is to return to the proper position in the Body of Christ through the Holy Spirit
Believers are sick because they fail and because they have become detached and separated from the Body of Christ
The book of James says that if anyone among us is sick, he can ask the elders of the church to anoint him with oil
We have to learn to be obedient persons so that our flesh will be morally restrained and so that we will not cause any trouble
There is one very crucial question, which is whether or not the meeting is standing on the ground of the church
The reason we do not go to the denominations to join them in the bread breaking is that they are not standing on the ground of the church
A sect is not standing on the ground of the church, because it bears a name which is not shared by the whole church
Is it trying its best to accommodate all of God's children, or is it digging deep ditches and building walls around its own small community?
Since there are so many denominations in one locality, no one meeting can claim to be the local church in that locality anymore
We can only say that we are merely an assembly that stands on the ground of the local church; we are not 'the local church'
One must not act independently, and there must be the willingness to move together with all the brothers who are not in the sects
Even though the church is in ruins today, there are still those who desire to walk outside the sects and human organizations
Strictly speaking, the expression 'standing on the ground of the church' applies only to today, a time when the church has become degraded
At present, the church is in ruins, and men have divided themselves into sects and walk according to human ways
In many places today, there are believers who see the error of the sects but who do not see the Body of Christ
God has not excused us from expressing the Body life just because other members have divisions among themselves
Those who live upstairs in the meeting hall should not wait until the first hymn is sung downstairs before they come down for the meeting
If two people open their mouths simultaneously, it is because both of them have not stood up before they opened their mouths
Of course, we can thank and praise the Lord through our prayers, but we should not remember our own needs during the bread-breaking meeting
Before the breaking of bread, we have the Lord Jesus before us; after the breaking of bread, we have the Father before us
After the breaking of bread, we see the Lord Jesus as the firstborn Son; we have a share in the Son of God and have become God's many sons
The Songs of Ascents recorded in the Psalms were songs the Israelites sang at the Feast of the Passover after they ate the Passover dinner
Some beginnings emphasize the Lords sufferings others emphasize the Lords glory and still others emphasize what the Lord has passed through
No hymn or prayer should come up with another line of emphasis, but they should strengthen and advance the existing line until the end
We are not in the meeting to take care of our personal relationship with the Lord but of the going on of the meeting in oneness
Of course, all our thanksgivings and praises are personal; if they are not personal, they are not real and are a speaking before others only
It is all right for a brother to read a passage of Scripture which leads others to the Lord or to remember the Lord
When we hear a message, we are merely listening to others speak about the Lord, and the goal is for our own benefit
The bread-breaking meeting is the time when we meet the Lord and remember Him; it is a time reserved for the Lord Himself
Some brothers can read a passage, others can ask questions, while still others can answer or give interpretations
No brother should involve his personal feelings in the meetings; they should all be left outside the door before entering the meeting
Perhaps we should open our mouth first to ask questions and show the other brothers something and then leave time for others to answer
When we ask questions, we should not ask only questions that we want to ask and skip other questions that we already know the answers to
The message meeting is for helping strong Christians, while the Bible study meeting is for helping weak believers
In the message meetings, only those who can receive the message receive help; those who cannot receive the message do not receive help
Those who are foolish, illiterate, slow, or dull can receive only forty to fifty percent of what is released in the message meetings
If everyone skips these meetings, the meetings will become small in number, and it will be a loss to the meeting
They should not think that they understand the subject, considering it to be repetitious because they have heard it several times
If you insist on arguing, you are doing wrong to your brother; you are not helping your brother but merely insisting on your own ideas
At other times we may see the gentleness love and patience of a brother but in the meetings we learn whether a brother is raw sour or sweet
You may be familiar and well acquainted with many truths, but your presence helps and strengthens your brother
You will make him feel that the brothers are holding up his hands, keeping them from becoming tired, and that he is not standing alone
In the gospel meeting, it is not a question of whether one lives a good personal life but whether his meeting life is proper
If we want to accomplish anything, and if we want to have the maximum power, the prayer meeting is where we can receive considerable help
The meeting life is a help to the spiritual life of a Christian; it is also an expression of the Body life of a Christian
Every time we want to bring up a matter for prayer, we should ask ourselves whether or not we have prayed over the same matter at home
If we have not prayed over the matter at home, there is no need to bring it up in the meeting and deceive the brothers
If you have never prayed for something in your home, the need is not there, and there is no value in praying over it
Anything that he does not have a burden to pray about in his room should not be brought up in the prayer meeting
If there is oneness and burden in our prayer during the prayer meeting, the power is surely greater than that of our individual prayers
If you feel that something has not been covered in the prayers, you should privately ask God to raise up others to pray and cast the net
After he prayed, another person continued on with his prayer and uttered all the things that needed to be prayed about
All those who are experienced in prayer know how difficult it is to find suitable utterance to express the needs
If we pray from 700 to 730 and successfully hit the point we can go home there is no need to go on praying because we have reached the goal
Since Shanghai is so large, the brothers and sisters are all scattered, and there is little fellowship between them
We may talk about how the brothers ought to behave as brothers, and we may also cover something related to the meetings
We cannot be individual believers before God; we have to learn to bear the responsibility of other brothers and sisters
In the world there are distinctions between the rich and the poor and in a family there are distinctions between the master and the servants
If a brother is the servant of another brother, he is, of course, a servant at home and should be obedient to his master in everything
On the other hand, a master should not think that just because he is a brother, he should not rule over his servant in a proper way
These meetings are for fellowship, for helping the brothers and sisters solve their problems, and for living the corporate life
God's way is to save individuals and put them into the church so that they can be blended together and help each other
Things like this cannot be brought up in the prayer meeting, the bread-breaking meeting, or the gospel meeting
Poor brothers should not purposely try to avoid rich brothers, and rich brothers should not ignore the need of poor brothers
The brothers should express the assembly life through the communal life, and they should express the proper life of brothers
The high point of the meeting is when someone prays and brings everyone up to a certain point, and everyone is released and says amen
It is common for us to bring our circumstances, family, and other things to the meeting, which frustrates our oneness
Both the breaking of bread and the offering of money should be done on this day, but they do not have to be done in the same meeting
For the sake of the brothers who are responsible for preaching, it is also better for the bread-breaking meeting to be in the evening
Some Protestant denominations such as the Anglican Church, Presbyterian Church, and Methodist Church also do the same thing
The brothers among us merely serve as the spokesmen of the other brothers, thanking and praising the Lord this way
The reason we do not kneel down is that the place is too small and would present a problem if we all knelt down
The Bible often mentions praying by covering up one's face, and a few times it mentions praying by sitting before the Lord
Answer: We should pray and ask God to stop the disenchanted ones in the denominations from coming into our midst
The breaking of bread is a display of the Lord's death; it is for exhibiting the Lord's death, and it is a testimony
Answer: The Bible says that we should kiss each other with a holy kiss ; it does not charge believers to merely kiss each other
The great dragon mentioned in Revelation is the old serpent; he dragged along with him one third of the stars of heaven
Even when we are preaching to someone on the street, it is related to the spiritual realm; as such, it is not that proper to keep our hat on
Question: In breaking the bread, should we break some off from the whole piece, or can we eat from the crumbs on the plate?
In other words, we will speak on the boundary of the local church or the extent of the border of the local church
Before we speak on this matter, there are a few things which we need to explain to the brothers from out of town
A person who serves as an elder in the assembly in Shanghai cannot go to the assembly in Peking and assume the same eldership
We would draw the brothers' and sisters' attention to the fact that in the Bible, the church is never divided into regions
Although there were seven churches in Asia, we do not see the Bible appointing Ephesus or Philadelphia to rule over the other six churches
God has never acknowledged one place as the center of all churches, with that place ruling over and controlling all the other assemblies
Every local church should maintain the testimony of the Body and express the Body of Christ in a miniature way
Our assemblies in the different localities are directly bound by Christ and are not controlled by any other assemblies
Today we are speaking on the responsibility of a local church; its responsibility is to God alone and not to any other local assembly
On the one hand, we should be bound by other assemblies so that we have the same footsteps and are the same as far as the truth goes
Every church mentioned in Revelation 2 and 3, like the church in Ephesus, the church in Smyrna, and the church in Pergamos, etc
No church can take the responsibility of another church, and no church can stand on the merit of another church
At the beginning it says that the words are for the messengers of the church in Ephesus, the church in Smyrna, the church in Pergamos, etc
The responsibility each church bears in a locality is before God alone, yet all the churches should have the same common move
When the Lord Jesus sent the disciples to preach the gospel, He charged them to go into the cities and villages
If God were to make the nation the boundary of the church, such a boundary would be changing all the time because nations often fall
God has made the city or village the boundary of the church because the names and boundaries of these places do not change easily
They are least affected by political changes; we can almost say that they are never affected by political changes
In many instances, a village was called by a certain name a few hundred years ago, and it is still called by the same name today
God made the city for the purpose of protection, so that there were city walls for its boundary and it could be separated from other things
Not only will God care for the city in the millennium, but He will care for the city even in the new heaven and new earth
Although we have said that the church sometimes takes a village as its boundary, a village is a miniature city in reality
If the whole church were to come together, they would have three thousand plus five thousand plus many other saved ones
The number meeting in the city of Jerusalem was large and the believers could not meet in one place they could only meet from house to house
We would rather not have a great central place of meeting and would rather meet separately in groups of fifty and one hundred
If they wanted to have more opportunity to know each other and communicate with each other, they could do it only once every few months
Please remember that the meeting in Gordon Lane and the meeting in Wen-teh Lane are not two churches but one church with one fellowship
If a brother meeting in Shanghai wants to go to the meeting in Nanking, he has to have a letter of recommendation
If he goes from the meeting in Wen-teh Lane to the meeting in Gordon Lane or vice versa, there is no need for a letter of recommendation
The offering from these two places is distributed by the same group of people, and all affairs are considered to be under one unit
We hope that the ones who are serving as elders will survey the land and decide who should break bread in each place
When they are strong enough to set up another meeting, they may become a 'home' meeting and may start meeting in the suburbs
If there are no clear political boundaries, the elders should measure and decide to which assembly a certain area should belong
Those brothers who live close to one assembly should meet with that assembly, and everyone should submit to authority in a proper way
These brothers wrote to the brothers in Gordon Lane and wanted to start another meeting in Bao-shan and break the bread there
If the meeting in Gordon Lane is a weak meeting, a subdivision will further weaken the situation and make it even more difficult to go on
We should not think that we can set up the Lord's table recklessly just because we want to break bread and remember the Lord in a place
Those brothers who intend to meet in Bao-shan should pray much, and the brothers in Shanghai should also pray much
In the Bible, we find both the greater ones laying hands on the smaller ones, and the smaller ones laying hands on the greater ones
We know that Paul and Barnabas were apostles, but the prophets and the teachers were the ones who laid hands on them
The laying on of hands in Acts 13 signifies that the church was joined to, sympathetic with, and in fellowship with Paul and his companion
It shows that their work and move were not just related to the two of them; they were related to the whole church in Antioch
We should brush aside or wipe away the dust of human tradition from biblical teachings as dust is wiped away from a mirror
Many people think that talking about elders, deacons, and the laying on of hands will make us the same as the denominations
Our goal is not to destroy the work of the denominations but to recover what God has ordained in the beginning
In Acts 13 the laying on of hands was not to manifest a gift but to express that they were all co-workers together
As to the miraculous gifts in the Bible, they should be present with us and should not be something of the past
Answer: In the meetings in Gordon Lane and Wen-teh Lane, we should have two or three elders take charge of everything
There should also be a few deacons or deaconesses in the meeting in Gordon Lane, just as there are some in Wen-teh Lane
For the sake of the work in the future, we hope that the brothers meeting in Gordon Lane can rent a larger place
Otherwise, some will think that the meeting in Gordon Lane is the branch church of the meeting in Wen-teh Lane
We should ask the brothers and sisters in both meetings to pray for this matter until they have the full assurance after their prayer
If it is a letter of recommendation from the denominations, we will not know whether he is clear about the truth and whether he is saved
If two or three brothers testify for and recommend a certain brother to the bread-breaking meeting, we can receive this one
There are also members of some denominations who break bread with us but return to the denominations to break bread there
The third is the teaching; a person must be able to discern the Body of Christ and must take the stand of the Body of Christ
There is no such thing as putting a man aside for a few months after he is saved and then baptizing such a one
