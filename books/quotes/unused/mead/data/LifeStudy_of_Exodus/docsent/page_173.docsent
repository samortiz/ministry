   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE DEALING WITH THE LAW A. The Loving Seekers of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us now go on to see how two different kinds of people dealt with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two kinds of people are the loving seekers of God Matt 22:36-38 and the letter-keepers of the law, the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of those who lovingly sought God, let us consider the experience of the psalmists in the Old Testament and that of Simeon and Anna in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Psalmists</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the book of Psalms, the psalmists loved the law to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some may teach that the law is something negative, but the psalmists treasured the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For years I was bothered by this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I even somewhat belittled the law in the book Christ and the Church Revealed and Typified in the Psalms, where I pointed out the contrast between the law in Psalm 1 and Christ in Psalm 2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I still believe that it is correct to make a contrast between the law in letters and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we love the law apart from Christ, we have missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, it is right to love the law as a testimony of God and as a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us now consider a number of passages from the Psalms which indicate how the psalmists dealt with God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>a. Loving God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The psalmists loved God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Psalm 18:1 says, I will love thee, O Lord, my strength.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 73:25 we have the testimony of one who loved God absolutely: Whom have I in heaven but thee?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The writer of this psalm loved God to such an extent that neither in heaven nor on earth did he have anyone besides God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Seeking God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The psalmists were also those who sought God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Psalm 42:1 and 2 say, As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The writer of this psalm was thirsty for God, seeking Him as a hart panting for water.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Psalm 43:4 shows how the psalmist sought God as his exceeding joy, and 119:2 and 10, how he sought God with his whole heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Dwelling with God</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Psalm 27:4 we see the psalmist s desire to dwell with God: One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The psalmist longed to dwell in God s house all his life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A similar desire is expressed in 84:1-7.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who read these verses are sure to be impressed by the sweetness of dwelling with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Psalm 90:1 declares, Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once again, we see the psalmist s desire to dwell with God and even in God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The same desire is expressed in 91:1, where the psalmist declares, He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We see in these verses something beyond caring for the letter of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The psalmist aspired to dwell in the secret place of God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who have such an aspiration will certainly be infused with the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>d Beholding His Beauty</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Psalm 27:4 also expresses the longing of the psalmists to behold the Lord s beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To behold the Lord s beauty is to see Him face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The same longing is found in 105:4: Seek the Lord, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</S>
