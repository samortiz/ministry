   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>That He Might Present to Himself the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After Eve had been prepared for Adam by being built out of Adam's rib, she was presented to Adam, the source from which she came.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In like manner, the church as Christ's counterpart will be presented to Christ, who is her source.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This presentation will not be done by God but by Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 5:27 says, "That He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she should be holy and without blemish."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we see that Christ will present the church to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, He will be both the presenter and the receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the past, Christ gave Himself up for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the present, He is sanctifying the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, in the future, He will present the church to Himself as His counterpart for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1 Glorious</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church Christ will present to Himself as His counterpart will be glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Glory is God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, to be glorious is to be God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually the church presented by Christ to Himself will be a God-expressing one; it will be the expression, the manifestation, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because Christ's sanctifying of the church causes her to be saturated with the essence of God, the church will become the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The only way for us to become God's expression is to be continually saturated with the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more we are saturated in this way, the more we become the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In His New Testament economy, God is working Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, Christ will present a glorious church to Himself not by coming merely in an objective way but by expanding within us and then coming out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ will glorify us not by descending upon us from the heavens but by coming forth from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The hope of glory is not the Christ in the heavens but the Christ who is in us Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, when God glorifies us, He will not need to send the glory from above; rather, He will cause Christ to shine forth from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that glorification is a subjective experience of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even now Christ is in the process of presenting a glorious church to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As this process takes place, He saturates our inner being with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul says, "We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our need today is to behold and reflect the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we behold His glory, we are transformed from glory to glory, that is, from one degree of glory to another degree.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more we behold the Lord's glory and are transformed by the Lord Spirit from glory to glory, the more the Lord will gain the glorious church He desires.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2 Not Having Spot or Wrinkle or Any Such Things</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The glorious church Christ presents to Himself will be a church "not having spot or wrinkle or any such things" Eph 5:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Spots are something out of the natural life, and wrinkles are signs of oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Humanly speaking, there is no way for us to remove such things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, God has a way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The water of life in the Word can metabolically wash away these defects by the transformation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more Christ sanctifies the church and cleanses her through the washing of the water in the Word, the fewer spots and wrinkles there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The spots and wrinkles will be removed metabolically.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that every flaw, defect, and imperfection will be removed by Christ's transforming life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The spots and wrinkles must be removed in order for the bride, Christ's counterpart, to be prepared for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be sure, the bride presented to Christ will not have any spots or wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Revelation 19:7 says, "Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Certainly by this time the bride will have been purified from all spots and wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The spots and wrinkles do not affect the function of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, they very much detract from the beauty of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church as Christ's bride must be beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason, Paul goes on from the function and daily living of the church as the new man in Ephesians 4 to the presentation of the church as the bride without spot or wrinkle in Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to be the bride of Christ, the church must become beautiful and have all spots and wrinkles removed.</S>
