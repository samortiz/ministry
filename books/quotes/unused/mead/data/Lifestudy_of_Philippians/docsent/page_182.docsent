   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONTENTMENT AND FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that anxiety is opposed to forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Anxiety is like a worm which devours our ability to forbear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we have no forbearance, it will be easy for us to be upset or to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anger often comes out of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I am worried about my future, my circumstances, or my family, I will not be happy with others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This worry will cause me to be upset with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only when we are happy and contented do we have forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a previous message we pointed out that happiness and contentment are two elements which produce forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only a happy, satisfied person can forbear.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One who is sorrowful and discontented, on the contrary, is easily irritated or offended.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because Paul was full of happiness and contentment, with him there was no anxiety, but an abundance of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know from Paul s word in 4:10-12 that, at least for a period of time, he was short of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But he could testify, I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He could say, I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to be in want.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because Paul had learned the secret, he could be content and, as a result, have an abundance of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many have pointed out that Philippians is a book of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Again and again Paul exhorts us to rejoice in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul s environment would have made it difficult for anyone to be joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not usually think of a prison as a place for rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But because Paul had no anxiety, no worry about his circumstances or future, he could rejoice in the Lord and be forbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>GOD S ASSIGNMENT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we would have a life free of anxiety, we need to realize that all our circumstances, good or bad, have been assigned to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to have this realization with a full assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose a brother is in business as a merchant.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His business may prosper, and he may earn a good deal of money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later his business may fail and he may lose much more than he earned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both earning money and losing it are God s assignment to him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If this brother has the full assurance that his circumstances come from God s assignment, he will be able to worship the Lord for His arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps losing money will benefit him more than earning money, for through such a loss he may be perfected and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, both illness and good health come from God as His assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should all aspire to be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But sometimes good health does not perfect us as much as a period of illness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, when our health fails, we may be more inclined to pray than when we are in good health.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first prerequisite to having no anxiety is to have the full assurance that all the sufferings we experience are God s assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What need is there to worry about things?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has assigned them to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He knows what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I was very young, I read a story about a conversation between two sparrows who were talking about the sorrows and the worries common among human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One sparrow asked the other why people worry so much.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The other sparrow answered, I don t think they have a Father who cares for them like we do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We don t need to worry about anything because our Father takes care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yes, our Father does care for us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But sometimes He sends us hardships and sufferings to serve in fulfilling our destiny to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can be freed from worry not because God has promised us a life without suffering, but because we know that all our circumstances come to us as God s assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul did not care about life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He cared only that Christ would be magnified in him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He realized that every circumstance was for his good.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the way to have no anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why do certain saints worry about losing money?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Simply because their desire is to have more money.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Why are others anxious about their health?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are anxious because they are afraid to die.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are ill, we need to declare, Satan, what can you do to me?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am not worried about death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Death does not make me anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, the possibility of dying gives me another opportunity to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead of fearing poverty, illness, or death, we should welcome them if God sends them to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we shall have no anxiety, for we shall know that every circumstance is an assignment from our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This does not mean, however, that we should seek suffering for its own sake.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not do things that will cause us to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who are in business should seek to make money, and those who are employees should try to get a promotion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if we lose money or even lose our job, we need not be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Such a loss comes from God s assignment, and we need not be anxious about it.</S>
