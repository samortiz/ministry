   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul continued to define the meaning of "in your mouth" and "in your heart" in verse 9 by saying, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear friends, where is your mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Each one of us has brought our mouth to this place.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>None has left his at home.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Where our body is, there our mouth is also.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the moment we believed in the Lord Jesus, we spontaneously confessed Him with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first words out of Paul's mouth when the Lord confronted him on the road were, "Who are You, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He had not believed in the Lord before.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But at that juncture he did believe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our confession of Jesus as Lord is made spontaneously from our heart rather than before people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It amazes me to think that some illiterate country folk who have never been exposed to the gospel before can say, "O Lord," upon hearing the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This cannot be a work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a spontaneous utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For one to believe in his heart is not a matter of work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no need to take any steps or to spend any money.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One only needs to say "O Lord" right where he is, and he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He can say it audibly or inaudibly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as he believes that God has brought Him down from the heavens and has brought Him up from Hades, everything will be worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will prove that he is justified and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our confession can never carry the element of merit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Confession is not a way to salvation; it is merely an expression of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a very spontaneous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we call Him Lord with our mouth and believe in Him in our heart, we shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no problem at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 10 follows and explains verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why is one saved when he confesses with his mouth Jesus as Lord and believes in his heart that God has raised Him from the dead?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was always perplexed as to how this matter could be put into people's hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I met two people today who consider this word of salvation too far from them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To them, this word is farther than the provinces of Yunnang and Tibet; it is farther than a foreign country.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is simply a word from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It seems that the word of salvation is so far away that it eludes them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, God says that the way of salvation is not in heaven nor beneath the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is very near, in our mouth and even in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we had to ascend into the heavens or descend under the earth, we would wonder how anyone could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today the word is in your mouth and in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as a person opens his mouth and believes in his heart, he shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has made this salvation so utterly available and convenient that if a person would believe in his heart and confess with his mouth, he shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Justification here is more a matter before God than before man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When men see you confessing, they will realize that you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When God sees you believing, He justifies you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 11 says, "Everyone who believes on Him shall not be put to shame."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Faith alone is enough.</S>
