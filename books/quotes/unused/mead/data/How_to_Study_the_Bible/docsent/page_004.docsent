   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As a rule, after a man becomes a Christian, he should know the things of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But why is it that so many brothers and sisters do not know them?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reason is that though they have a regenerated spirit, they are not necessarily spiritual men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul's emphasis in 1 Corinthians 2 and 3 is not merely the spirit but to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John's emphasis is the spirit, but Paul's emphasis is on being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A man must not only have the spirit but must be spiritual according to this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One must have the spirit; without the spirit one can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But to have the spirit alone without living under the principle of this spirit, that is, without living in this spirit and walking according to this spirit to be a spiritual man, is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose you take a man who is born blind into a garden and tell him that he is standing in front of a mango tree.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You can explain to the blind man what the fruits are like.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But will he understand what you are saying?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if he is very clever, very discerning, and has very sharp ears, he will still not understand what a mango tree is like.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You can tell him about green, but he will not understand what green is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The world of sound is different from the world of sight, and the world of sight is different from the world of thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the same way, one has to exercise his spirit before he can realize the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who have eyes may not necessarily see; one must exercise the function of the eyes before he can see.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A blind man cannot see the mango tree.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A man with good eyes can only see the mango tree if he opens his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A blind man cannot see the mango tree with his ears.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A normal man cannot see the mango tree either if he only uses his ears.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The problem today is that blind ones have no eyes to see the mango tree, while men with good eyes try to hear the mango tree with their ears.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A soulish man cannot know God; no one can know Him by turning to soulish faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But a man with a regenerated spirit does not know God either if he only uses his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This does not mean that anyone who has a spirit can know God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even after God's Spirit has entered into a man, it is still possible for that man to not know God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Wisdom and intelligence do not help an unbeliever know God; neither do they help a Christian know God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Knowledge does not help an unbeliever understand the Bible; neither does it help a Christian understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way to understand the Bible is by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not merely a matter of having the spirit, but a matter of being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one can say that he has a spirit but does not have to walk according to it and instead can walk according to his former ways.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such ways were unacceptable when the man did not have a regenerated spirit; they are equally unacceptable now that he has a regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fundamental way to the understanding of the Bible is through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason Paul showed us in 1 Corinthians 2 that the issue is not having or not having the spirit, but of being spiritual or not being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Spiritual things are discerned only by spiritual men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Corinthians 3:1 says, "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here is another word: fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Corinthian believers were infants in Christ; they were fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the reason verse 2 says, "I gave you milk to drink, not solid food."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be sure, such ones are not totally ignorant of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet they can only touch the most obvious revelations; they cannot touch anything deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are fleshy, and therefore they can only take milk, not solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Milk is for those in their first stage of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that these ones can only take the most elemental revelations in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Solid food, on the other hand, is for a grown-up throughout his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It refers to the deeper and more profound revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A man does not continue drinking milk all the time; there is only a short period during his life when he has to drink milk.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet there are men who, like the Corinthian believers, are drinking milk all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"For you were not yet able to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But neither yet now are you able."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First Corinthians 2 and 3 show us three kinds of men:</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First, there is the soulish man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such a man merely possesses all the faculties of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can call him the psychological man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A soulish man is an unregenerated man; he does not have a regenerated spirit and does not have the proper organ to understand God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such a person cannot understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Second, there is the fleshy man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Such a man has God's life and His Spirit within him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But he walks not according to this spirit but according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He has a regenerated spirit, but he does not use his spirit or subject himself to the rule of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He has a spirit, but he does not come under the control of the spirit or allow the spirit to take over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Bible calls this kind of person fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He has a very limited understanding of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He can only take milk, not solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Milk is something that is first digested by the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It refers to indirect revelations, revelations that do not come to a person directly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A man who drinks milk cannot receive any direct revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He receives revelation from other spiritual men, who transfer such revelation to him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Third, there is the spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Such a person has the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He operates under the power of the living Spirit and walks according to the principle of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The amount of revelation he receives is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's Word says that spiritual things can only be discerned by spiritual men.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In order to study the Bible, we have to remember these basic requirements: We must be spiritual and we must walk according to the spirit.</S>
