<h1 class="title">THE STANDING BOARDS AND THE TABERNACLE<br />
IN THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S DWELLING PLACE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:8; 26:15, 26-30; 29:45-46; 40:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL REVELATION IN GENESIS AND EXODUS</h2>
<p>When we read Genesis and Exodus, we need to pay attention to the central revelation of God. Without this revelation, it is not easy to see God&rsquo;s intention in Genesis. Jacob is the father of the children of Israel. The crucial point with Jacob is that he saw Bethel in the revelation that he received from God (28:17-19). Many years later God told Jacob to go to Bethel (35:1). <em>Bethel</em> means &ldquo;the house of God.&rdquo; God wanted to obtain His house with Jacob, His chosen one. While Jacob was fleeing from his brother, he was homeless. However, God did not lead him to care for his own house but rather to care for God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>God led Jacob to focus on Bethel, which is the house of God. The main item in relation to Jacob is God&rsquo;s house. God chose Jacob out of thousands of people in order to gain a house. God wanted to obtain a dwelling place on earth through Jacob. In other words, God desires to gain a dwelling place, a house, on earth through His chosen ones.</p>
<p>In the beginning of Exodus Jacob&rsquo;s descendants, the children of Israel, were slaves in Egypt. However, God wanted to deliver them out of the land of Egypt. The children of Israel were enslaved in Egypt and were oppressed and afflicted. They needed God&rsquo;s deliverance. Perhaps they never thought of God&rsquo;s house. They thought of their need, but perhaps they did not consider God&rsquo;s need. They may have thought only of their problems, that is, that they were oppressed and afflicted. They did not know that God wanted to obtain a dwelling place on earth. They knew that God cared for them and would deliver them from the land of Egypt, but they did not know why God would deliver them. Not only were the children of Israel ignorant of the reason for God&rsquo;s deliverance, but even Bible readers throughout the generations have not seen the purpose of God&rsquo;s deliverance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING TO DWELL<br />
IN THE MIDST OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL,<br />
TO HAVE A DWELLING PLACE AMONG THEM</h2>
<p>I received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation before I was twenty years old; that was thirty years ago. Since then I have been pursuing to know the Bible. I have read many expositions and commentaries on the book of Exodus, but I have yet to read a book that explicitly says that God delivered the Israelites out of Egypt so that He might obtain a dwelling place among them. I have never read a book that says this clearly. Sometimes there may be one or two sentences in a book that elude to such a purpose, but not in a clear way. We must see that the main reason God delivered the Israelites out of Egypt was not only because they were suffering oppression and affliction. God delivered the Israelites out of Egypt because He intended to build a dwelling place among them.</p>
<p>Exodus 25:8 says that God desired to dwell in the midst of the children of Israel. After God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt, they crossed the Red Sea and journeyed to the foot of Mount Sinai. There God told them that He wanted to dwell among them. God said, &ldquo;I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and I will be their God. And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell in the midst of them; I am Jehovah their God&rdquo; (29:45-46). God seemed to be saying that He delivered the children of Israel so that He might obtain a dwelling place, a house, in their midst. However, we should never think that the tabernacle was the extent of the house of God. The tabernacle was only a sign, a symbol. We must see that God&rsquo;s house was Israel. God did not want to dwell in the tabernacle. God wanted to dwell in the midst of the children of Israel. In other words, the children of Israel were God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DELIVERING US OUT OF THE WORLD<br />
FOR A POSITIVE AND GLORIOUS PURPOSE</h2>
<p>The delivery of the children of Israel out of Egypt is a type in the Old Testament. As God&rsquo;s chosen ones, we are today&rsquo;s Israel. We are God&rsquo;s people. God delivered us out of the world, just as He delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt. Before we were saved, we felt that we were desolate and suffering in the world because our life was vain and without hope. But God saved us. God saved us out of the world not merely to deliver us from the afflictions of the world. He saved us for a positive and glorious goal. God saved us because He wants us to be built up to become His house, the church. God desires that we be built up to be His house.</p>
<p>After the Israelites left Egypt, they received a revelation from God at the foot of Mount Sinai, and according to that revelation they built a tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This signifies that the children of Israel were built up as God&rsquo;s house. On the first day of the first month in the second year, the tabernacle was erected, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle. This was God coming to dwell in the tabernacle. God dwelt in the midst of the children of Israel. The first chapter of Exodus speaks of the Israelites being slaves in Egypt, and the last chapter speaks of the Israelites being God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This is a very clear picture. Exodus uses forty chapters to present this picture. In chapter 1 the Israelites were ill-treated in the hand of Pharaoh. They were enslaved and making bricks for Pharaoh&rsquo;s cities. However, by the last chapter of Exodus, they were the glorious dwelling place of God. God dwelt in their midst, and the glory of God filled their midst.</p>
<p>We think that God rescued us from afflictions and disasters so that our lives would be meaningful. However, this is not God&rsquo;s goal. God has a glorious and positive goal related to His salvation. He intends to build us up to be His dwelling place, His house, so that He can fill this house for His expression.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ Making His Home in Our Heart and the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
