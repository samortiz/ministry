THE STATIONS IN ROMANS</h2><p>In the book of Romans we see several stations. Many Christians have stopped at the station of justification in Romans 4. Some have gone further to the station of sanctification in Romans 8. Other seeking Christians have gone as far as chapter twelve and talk about the Body, although they lack the genuine experience of the Body. Thus, Romans 12 becomes a station, which we may describe as the station of the Body talkers. If you are content to remain in Romans 12, you will not have the Body actually and practically, because the Body is fully realized in the local churches. If you are not in a local church, you cannot touch the Body. The word, &ldquo;Body,&rdquo; will simply remain an empty term as far as you are concerned. If you want to be in the Body, you must be in a local church. Hence, our station is in chapter sixteen, the last station in the book of Romans. Where are you? We have passed through the station of justification, sanctification, and the stage of talking about the Body. Praise the Lord that we are abiding in the last station, in the local churches, where we realize the genuine Body life. When you are resting in this station, you can join Paul in his concluding melody of praise.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE WARNING CONCERNING DIVISION</h2><p>Nevertheless, in Romans 16, a chapter which unveils the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s work, Paul speaks of something negative because God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, is still working here. &ldquo;Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them. For such men do not serve as slaves our Lord Christ, but their own appetites; and by smooth and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). While we are enjoying the local church life, we must be watchful for those who cause divisions. In verse 17 Paul refers to &ldquo;the teaching.&rdquo; What teaching is this? It is the teaching of the Apostle, such as in the book of Romans. Any discussion or dissension contrary to the Apostle&rsquo;s teaching is divisive, and we must keep a watchful, discerning eye over it. According to verse 17, we must turn away from those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to this teaching. Even in Paul&rsquo;s time there was the problem of division caused by the dissenting ones. Therefore, we also must be on the alert. Otherwise, our church life may be damaged by the &ldquo;smooth and flattering speech&rdquo; of the dissenters who are out to deceive the simple. Most &ldquo;churching&rdquo; people are simple. We must be simple in order to be in the church life. However, some may come to you with smooth, flattering, eloquent talk, seeking to divide the church and to cause you to fall. Do not think that you cannot be deceived. Be on the alert.</p><p>How can we discern the talk of those who come to us with flattering words? There is just one way. We must ask: Does it cause division? Do not accept any talk that causes division, regardless of how smooth and flattering the words may be. We must reject any talk that is contrary to the teaching of the book of Romans. We must renounce it strongly. Furthermore, we must turn away from those who speak in such a way. If Paul faced that kind of difficulty in his time, surely it will also occur in our time because of the subtlety of the enemy. Thus, while we are happy, excited, and praising the Lord for the church life, we must keep a watchful eye over those who cause divisions. We should not be deceived by men&rsquo;s smooth words, but should ask ourselves the question: Is this talk contrary to the Apostle&rsquo;s teaching and is it divisive? We must heed the warning given to us by Paul in the last chapter of Romans.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_117.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_119.html">Next</a> </body></html>
