   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Operating by Growing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because the highest law, the law of the divine life, is operating within us, there is no need for us to strive to overcome negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Instead of striving, we should simply allow the law of life to work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we need to see that this law works only as the divine life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us once again use a peach tree as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If for some reason a peach tree is not allowed to grow, the law of the peach tree will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if the peach tree is watered and fertilized, it will grow, and as it grows, the law within it will work spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through the working of the peach-tree law, the tree will automatically produce peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The principle is the same with the working of the highest law, the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The essence of this law is the Holy Spirit and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not the law of letters; it is the law of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Likewise, it is not the law of knowledge; it is the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, this law is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although this law is now within us, the operation of this law depends upon the growth of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How marvelous that we have such a law as the first of the divine provisions revealed in Romans 8!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of us who were Christians for years before we came into the church life in the Lord s recovery can testify that we never heard that in the New Testament there is a law called the law of the Spirit of life and that this law is working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need proper teaching regarding this law working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, we need an unveiling, a disclosure, of the fact that within us as Christians there is such a divine, profound, and mysterious law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we had only doctrine and teachings and not the experience of the law of the Spirit of life working in us, then to us God s salvation would become a religion or a system of ethics similar to the ethical teachings of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Confucius could teach ethics, but he could not impart into others the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What we need is not ethical teachings, but the inward working of this divine law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Husbandmen and gardeners know that it is not necessary to teach plants and trees to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Living plants do not take classes and then after a period of time have a graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead of teaching plants and trees, gardeners fertilize them, water them, and kill the bugs that destroy them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Gardeners do anything necessary to protect the trees and help them grow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then as the plants and trees grow, the law within them will work automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Divine Provision</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I came to this country, I began to tell the Lord s people that we need the living Christ, not doctrine or theology.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need the divine life, and in this life there is the divine law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our need today is not for more doctrine; our need is for the marvelous divine provision of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May we all realize that we have this divine law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can understand more concerning the working of the law of the divine life by considering how the natural law of the human life works in a baby.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no need, for example, to teach an infant not to eat things that taste bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If something bitter is placed into a baby s mouth, the baby will automatically try to spit it out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, the baby will spontaneously drink what is pleasing to the taste.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In either case, there is no need for teaching, for the human life in the baby operates automatically according to its law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the physical life of a child is the law of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As soon as a child is born, this law begins to operate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The principle is the same with the divine life that we received through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have emphasized the fact that in the divine life there is a divine law and that this law works automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose someone repents and believes in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The next day he may begin to realize that there is something living within him that does not agree with certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This new believer has not been taught to refrain from those things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But through regeneration he has received the divine life with the divine law, and this law is now working within him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result of the working of the divine law, this new believer has the feeling that he should no longer do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the operation of the law of life on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the positive side, this new believer can now receive the rich provisions of the divine life to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The law of life is the first provision in the divine life for us to live a proper daily Christian life.</S>
