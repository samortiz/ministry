   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 7 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 10:1, 7-10, 14-15</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 And He called His twelve disciples to Him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they would cast them out and heal every disease and every sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>7 And as you go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Freely you have received; freely give.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>9 Do 1 not acquire for yourselves gold nor silver nor copper for your belts;</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>10 No bag for the journey nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>14 And whoever does not receive you nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>15 Truly I say to you, It will be 1 more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 10:1-4 we have the appointment of the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Prior to chapter ten the Lord carried out His kingly ministry alone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But beginning in this chapter the twelve apostles were added for the enlarging, the spread, of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The authority here v. 1 to cast out unclean spirits and heal diseases is a foretaste of the power of the coming age Heb 6:5 , that is, of the millennium, in which all demons will be cast out and all diseases will be healed Isa 35:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>An apostle is a sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now the twelve disciples v. 1 were to be sent; thus they became the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In sending out the twelve apostles, the Lord arranged them in pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to be impressed with this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all must be paired.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>None of us, especially the young people, should go anywhere by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need another one to match us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever you are burdened by the Lord to go to a certain place, do not go by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, go in pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do not have another one to match you, you will miss the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to receive the blessing, you must be paired.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not my opinion; it is the Lord's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, we all must learn the lesson to be paired, to be matched with others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 10:5-15 we have the way to spread the gospel of the kingdom to the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verses 5 and 6 we see that the Lord Jesus charged the twelve apostles not to go into the way of the Gentiles or into a city of the Samaritans, but only to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Samaritans were a mixture of Gentiles and Jewish blood 2 Kings 17:24; Ezra 4:10; John 4:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord sends us, the authority, the presence of the Lord, and the peace follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason the Lord told the apostles to look for one worthy of their peace Matt 10:11, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To receive the Lord's sent ones, the apostles, means to receive the presence of the Lord and the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To reject them means to reject the presence of the Lord and the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not an insignificant matter to be sent by the Lord, for as sent ones, we become the Lord's representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Wherever we go, we bring His authority, His presence, and His peace with us.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>9 1 The twelve apostles sent to the house of Israel, not to the Gentiles , as workers worthy of their food, did not need to bring their necessities with them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the Lord's workers sent to the Gentiles should take nothing from the Gentiles 3 John 7.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This principle was changed after the Lord had been fully rejected by the house of Israel Luke 22:35-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>15 1 Indicating that the punishment resulting from God's judgment is in varying degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rejecting the Lord's apostles and their words v. 14 will bring more punishment than will the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah.</S>
