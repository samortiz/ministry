   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The title Jerusalem is composed of two Hebrew words Jeru meaning foundation, and Salem meaning peace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul tells us in Hebrews 7 that the king of Salem is the king of peace v. 2 . Salem is peace, and Jeru is that which is founded, built, and laid as a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, Jerusalem means the foundation of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jerusalem is that which is grounded, founded, and safeguarded in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible indicates that peace is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament there are two titles the God of peace Phil 4:9; 1 Thes 5:23 and the peace of God Phil 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both of these titles indicate that God Himself is our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also, Ephesians 2:14 indicates that Christ Himself is our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This peace is God into whom we have been grounded.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not an outward peace but an inward peace in which we are safeguarded.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In eternity we will enjoy this peace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus told us, Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you John 14:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our Lord also said in John 16:33, These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the world you have affliction, but take courage; I have overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since the Lord has given us His peace, today we should live in His peace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, the Lord Himself is still here as our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jerusalem is the Triune God to be our peace, to be our safety.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The entire New Jerusalem will be an entity of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Jerusalem will be solidly grounded and safeguarded in the Triune God as peace and safety, and we will enjoy the Triune God as peace forever.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3 The Aggregate of All the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since the New Jerusalem is the bride, we should not consider her as a material city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ will marry only something living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The bride will be composed of all the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed saints of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Jerusalem there will be no wood, bricks, or dust.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, there will be gold, pearl, and transformed precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fact that the New Jerusalem is such a living composition means that it is a living building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The thought that God s people are a living building is not first found in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Old Testament we see that God s people were considered material to be built together as His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible covers two main things God s creation and God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the beginning of the Bible we have creation, and at the end we have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Between these two ends we have God s building work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In creation God produced the building materials.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As He carries on His building work, He fits all these materials together into one unit, which is His building.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Genesis 2 we have a garden created, and in Revelation 21 we have a city constructed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A garden is something natural, created by God, but a city is something built up by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The New Jerusalem is not a natural garden but a built-up city.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the garden in Genesis 2 there is the tree of life, and near the tree of life there is a river flowing in four directions vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By the flow of this river we have gold, bdellium, and onyx, a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Bdellium here is a resin secreted by a tree that hardens to form a pearl-like substance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first mention of stone in the Bible is not of ordinary, common stone but of onyx, a type of precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the record of Genesis 28, Jacob, a supplanter, had a divine dream in which he saw a ladder set up on earth and reaching to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When he awoke from his sleep, he called the name of that place the house of God v. 17 . Then he took the stone he had used for a pillow, set it up as a pillar, anointed it with oil, and called it Bethel, meaning the house of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>18-19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to Exodus 28, twelve precious stones were set on the breastplate of the high priest vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>15-21 , the first of which was sardius and the last of which was jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Included among these twelve stones was onyx.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This indicates that the breastplate of the high priest is related to both Genesis 2 and Revelation 21, for in Genesis 2 we have onyx, and in Revelation 21 we have jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the description of the breastplate of the high priest and of the two onyx stones engraved with the names of the children of Israel Exo 28:9-12 , we see a miniature of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The precious stones of both the breastplate and the shoulder pieces bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This signifies that the redeemed Israelites are for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The twelve precious stones on the breastplate were set in gold.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The gold base held all the precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Certainly this is a picture of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This breastplate was a type of the building that expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John 1 tells us that when Peter first met the Lord Jesus, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone v. 42 . After Peter received the revelation that the Lord was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said, I also say to you that you are a stone, and upon this rock I will build My church Matt 16:18, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>. In this one verse we have the stone and the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Later, in his first Epistle, Peter says, Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house 2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, the concept that the believers are stones to be built up for God s habitation is not new in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is found elsewhere in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we put together all the portions of the Word concerning the stone, we will see that precious stones signify God s redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the stones with which the New Jerusalem is built are God s redeemed, regenerated, and transformed saints.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The apostle Peter tells us clearly that we are living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now we are in the process of transformation and of being built into God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>First, God transforms us; then He builds us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, the New Jerusalem is not a pile of material; it is a composition of material that has been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The entire city of New Jerusalem is God s building, the living composition of all God s redeemed, regenerated, and transformed saints.</S>
