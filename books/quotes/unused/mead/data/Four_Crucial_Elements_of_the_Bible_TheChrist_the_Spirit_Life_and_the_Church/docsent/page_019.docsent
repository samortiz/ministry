   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Animals</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the category of animals.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is even more mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is a lamb, an ox, a lion, an eagle, a dove, and a turtledove.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a lamb, He became an offering to deal with our sins for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As an ox, He was not only made an offering but also became lowly to bear our burdens as a slave of God for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a lion, He is the victorious One overcoming Satan on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As an eagle, He is the transcendent and heavenly One who carries us that we may rise above everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a dove, He is beautiful and guileless, and as a turtledove, He is lowly and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, these types have their sequences.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First there is the dove and then the eagle; first there is the Lamb which was slain and then the overcoming Lion of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is not only the cattle and the fowl, but He is even the bronze serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He told Nicodemus, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up" John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that when He was crucified on the cross, He was the bronze serpent, which had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent's poison.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He had the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 but was without the reality of sin Heb 4:15; 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is One who is truly rich.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Plants</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among the plants, there are even more types concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord said that He is the true vine John 15:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is only one vine in the universe that is true, and this true vine is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Song of Songs 2:3 says that He is the apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreover, the Old Testament tells us that the different parts of a tree are also types of Christ: Christ is the root Isa 11:10; Rev 5:5 , the stem, and the stump; He is also the branch Isa 11:1 and the fruit 4:2; Rev 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, the New Testament tells us that He is the fruit of Mary's womb Luke 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The most mysterious thing is that Christ is the tree itself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the unique tree of life in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is also the acacia wood, which signifies that His humanity is noble and strong in quality and lofty and superior in standard.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is truly marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Minerals</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we come to the types seen in the minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is the pure gold, silver, brass, and iron Deut 8:13, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is different kinds of stone: the living stone 1 Pet 2:4 , the rock 1 Cor 10:4; 1 Pet 2:8 , the cornerstone v. 7; Matt 21:42 , the topstone Zech 4:7 , and the foundation stone 1 Cor 3:11 . If we study the gold, silver, precious stones, and different kinds of stone that are mentioned in the Old Testament, we can see that Christ is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Offerings</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, there are the types seen in the offerings, which are even more difficult to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have covered these to a great extent in the life-studies of the Pentateuch.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Old Testament, Exodus is an introduction to the offerings, Leviticus is the text, and Numbers and Deuteronomy are the supplements.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are five main offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In addition, there are the wave offering, the heave offering, the voluntary offering, and the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are all types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Foods</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are also the foods that are types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As food, Christ is the bread of life John 6:35 , the manna descended from heaven v. 51 , and the hidden manna Rev 2:17 . He is also various kinds of choice fruits grapes, figs, pomegranates, and olives Deut 8:8 . He is the fruit of the tree of life Rev 2:7 , as well as wheat, barley, milk, and honey Deut 8:8; 6:3 , to be man's supply and nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These six major categories in the Old Testament are all types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if you have read through the entire Old Testament, you do not understand it unless you know these six categories.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we thoroughly study these matters, the Old Testament will be transparent and open to us.</S>
