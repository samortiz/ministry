   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ALL THREE COEXISTING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>EXISTING AT THE SAME TIME</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND NOT BEING IN MODES STAGES</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Matthew 3:16-17 we see that the Father, Son, and Spirit all exist at the same time; that is, They coexist.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this wonderful picture of the divine Trinity, Jesus the Son went up from the water after being baptized; at the same time the Spirit descended upon Him; and also at the same time the Father spoke from the heavens concerning the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Still further, notice John 14:16-17: "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these two verses we have the Son praying to the Father that the Father would send the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all present at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Ephesians 3:14-17 Paul says that he will pray the Father to grant us to be strengthened through His Spirit into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this passage we have the Father, the Spirit, and Christ the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All exist at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible does not say that the Father existed for a certain period of time, then the Father became the Son so the Father stopped existing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Neither does it say that after a certain period of time the Son no longer existed because He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a wrong teaching, a heresy called "modalism."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The people teaching this think that God exists in three successive modes or stages: first the Father, then the Son, and finally the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot accept this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Scriptures clearly tell us that all Three eternally coexist.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Word is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was present in eternity with God the Father, and He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John 17:5 the Lord prayed concerning the glory He had shared with the Father before the world was.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both the Father and Son, then, are coeternal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That the Spirit also is eternal is clear from Hebrews 9:14, where He is called "the eternal Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was this Triune God who said in Genesis 1:26: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All Three were there before man's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>ALL THREE COINHERING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>LIVING WITHIN ONE ANOTHER ETERNALLY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AND NOT BEING THREE SEPARATE GODS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit not only coexist but also coinhere, which means that they live within one another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 14 clearly says that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To see the Son is to see the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Son speaks, it is the Father who is working.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Two are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible goes on to say that the Son, after death and resurrection, became the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Son, in whom is the Father, has become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, the Triune God can come into the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Son comes to us as the Spirit; and when the Son comes, the Father comes as well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From one side, They are three; but from the other side, They are one because They cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Lesson One we have seen that the Father, Son, and Spirit are one God, not three.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But, deep within, some Christians consider the Father, Son, and Spirit as three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some even clearly state this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Others may not say this in words, but they do hold this concept subconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The teaching of three Gods is called "tritheism" and is a great heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once a brother asked a certain Christian preacher who did not believe that the Son is the Father and that the Lord is the Spirit, "Brother, how many Gods are the Father, Son, and Spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The preacher replied clearly and definitely that there were three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such a statement is absolutely heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The revelation of the Bible is that God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is one, yet three; three, yet one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Father, Son, and Spirit coexist and coinhere eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are not modalists or tritheists we just believe the pure revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Amen!</S>
