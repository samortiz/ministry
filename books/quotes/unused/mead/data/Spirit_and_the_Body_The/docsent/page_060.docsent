   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When anyone comes to you with a negative, opposing attitude, do not touch the points he raises right away, because at that time the opposer is on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you touch the points of opposition, you will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Instead of touching the points, slow down, cool down, and prepare the way for a second contact.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not be in a rush to solve all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more you attempt to solve the problems, the more trouble you will cause.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After you have taken down all the points, pray about them and see if you have the answers for them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If not, fellowship with other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this way you will find the answer and learn something yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then try to have another time with the opposing one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But do not tell him you have all the answers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, in a gradual way, item by item, solve his problems by injecting something into him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Human beings are human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By God's creation, every human being has a conscience and a sense of fairness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are genuine, honest, faithful, and nice, the other party will appreciate you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you present matters solidly, rightly, and fairly, the opposer's sense of fairness will confirm what you say, and something will get into him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But do not expect immediate results.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A fisherman must be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hasty fishermen catch nothing; they only frighten the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even from the opposition we should be able to gain some increase.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you not believe that you can bring in one opposer yearly?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means, of course, that we must labor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do not labor, we shall not bring in anything, even if we wait until eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some of you may feel that you have no contacts, but you may know some opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The opposers are the best contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need for you to go to them for they will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the opposers are like fish who come to a fisherman and say, "Here I am, ready to be hooked."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But you may not believe that the opposers can be hooked.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because you may think that they are enemies and attackers, you may not appreciate them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I beg you to change your concept and begin to appreciate every opposer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When an opposer comes to you, you should say inwardly, "Praise the Lord, a good fish has come."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But do not try to hook him right away.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, in wisdom, bind the opposer secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hold on to a secret line that will not let him go.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problems he raises are the bait.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more questions he asks and the more problems he raises, the more free bait you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Take the problems and questions home, cook the bait, and bring it back to the fish the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then the fish will swallow it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But still do not hook him too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do so, you will lose him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, you do not need to hook him, for he will be happy to swallow the hook.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And when he gets hooked, he will be glad.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I hope that a year from now many of us will be able to praise the Lord that we have caught an opposer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we all do this, the opposers will be terrified and say, "Don't touch those people."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not think that I am too idealistic.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This has actually happened in Fullerton, a city near Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The brothers and sisters there have gained the victory by taking down the questions raised by the opposers, by studying them, and by going back to talk to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The truth is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have the case, and the truth is on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, we are not afraid to be opposed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we have real gold, we should not be afraid for that gold to be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more the gold is tested, the more its golden nature is manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to practice all the points covered in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we practice them, we shall gain a good increase.</S>
