BY THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>I hope that the responsible saints will see the vision of the building of the church. The building must be in our loving the Lord, our consecration, and our spirituality. Everything is for the building. If a brother is so spiritual that he cannot be built up with others, his spirituality is not genuine and should be thrown away; he is better off without that spirituality. If a brother claims that he is receiving the breaking of the cross but becomes more individualistic and isolated and eventually cannot coordinate with anyone, his &ldquo;breaking&rdquo; is false. Our loving the Lord and living for Him and our spirituality and brokenness can be genuine only when we are built up.</p>
<p>All our spiritual experiences must be measured by the building. Only the experiences that can bring in the building up are proper. Even if our experiences are very good, they are not proper if they cannot bring in the building up. Many Christians know how to pray, but some may prefer to pray alone because they think that others are not as advanced in the matter of prayer. Such prayers are surely improper and may cause problems. We should be able to pray with anyone. If we can pray only with those who have received spiritual training, we have a problem.</p>
<p>Can we ask a brother who loves the world and a brother who is quick-tempered to pray with us for the gospel? Can we simply pray with them for the gospel, while avoiding any teaching related to not loving the world and not losing one&rsquo;s temper? Many so-called spiritual saints cannot do this. If our spirit is closed and we cannot pray with those who love the world or with those who are quick-tempered, then we are not broken. If we are really broken, we would be able to pray with Demas, who loved the present age (2 Tim. 4:10). A person who has learned the lesson, loves the Lord, fears Him, and lives before Him would be able to pray with a weak brother without thinking that this brother is weak. If we would pray with a weak brother for the gospel, he would be revived without our exhortation. This is the building up; this is the Body. The Body clothes the uncomely members with more abundant honor. God is pleased to give more honor and comeliness to such members (1 Cor. 12:23-24).</p>
<p>God does not necessarily hear our prayers when we pray with those whom we highly regard. We may pray for the revival of the church, but the church falls into a low situation instead. However, He hears our prayers when we pray with the saints who are considered to be weak. If we ask for the revival of the church, the church will be revived. Those who are experienced know not to seek to pray only with so-called spiritual saints. We should look for the saints who are considered to be uncomely and pray with them. Then the gospel will be powerful, and sinners will be saved. If we are built up, we will treat everyone the same, whether or not they are comely. We cannot be individualistic; we must pray with the saints. We should not pray only with those who match our taste; we should be able to pray with any saint.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OBJECT OF GOD&rsquo;S BLESSING</h2>
<p>The more we are built up, the more we can fellowship and pray with any saint, and the church will be blessed. If two responsible brothers cannot pray with other saints, that church will &ldquo;close its doors&rdquo; after a few years. God&rsquo;s blessing depends on His presence, and His presence depends on the building up of the church. He will not bless our individual spirituality; He will only bless the Body that He is building. We may consider someone to be unacceptable, but God would say, &ldquo;This one is in the Body.&rdquo; We may consider someone as unsatisfactory, but God would say, &ldquo;I have blended him in the Body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God cannot bestow His blessing on the earth, because we are not willing to be built up. We hope to receive God&rsquo;s blessing individually, but He is not focused on blessing individuals. His desire is to build up the Body of Christ. We want to be spiritual individually and to read the Bible. However, regardless of how much effort we exert, we cannot read the Bible well if we are not built up.</p>
<p>If a brother decides to stay home and read the Bible by himself instead of meeting in a district with brothers who work as janitors or have limited education, he will not understand much in his reading, and he will eventually stop reading the Bible after a few months. However, if he reads the Bible with those brothers, the Holy Spirit will speak to him, and he will be enlightened to understand what he could not understand when he read by himself. This is marvelous. We pay attention to being blessed individually, but God does not focus on blessing individuals. His blessing is upon His house, the Body of Christ. I speak often to God&rsquo;s children, but I can testify that my speaking would be greatly reduced without the children of God. My speaking is for God&rsquo;s children. God&rsquo;s focus is not to bless individuals but to bless the church.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we can neglect our spirituality. Every serving one should learn to live before the Lord, follow Him in the spirit, and fellowship with Him. However, we need to remember that God does not bless individual spirituality. This is according to His ordination. If we see this vision, we will fall down before Him and say, &ldquo;Have mercy upon me. Regardless of the condition of the brothers, I must be built up with them. Whether or not they are spiritually advanced, I must coordinate with them. I will accept the Body that You have blended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our common problem is that we often feel that what God has arranged for others is better than what He has arranged for us. For example, Mrs. Chang may say that Mrs. Lee&rsquo;s husband is better, and Mrs. Lee may say that Mrs. Wang&rsquo;s husband is better. The brothers may also say that others have a better wife. Similarly, the saints in the church in Taipei think that the church in Kaohsiung is better, and those in the church in Kaohsiung think that the church in Taipei is better. However, it is not a matter of being good or bad; everyone and everything is arranged by God. We need to trust Him, for He cannot make a mistake. Whatever He arranges is the best situation. If we do not accept His arrangement, we will forsake and reject the building, and our condition will match Haggai 1: &ldquo;Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled-up houses, while this house lies waste?...You have sown much, but you bring in little; you eat, but there is no satisfaction; you drink, but there is no being filled with drink; you dress yourselves, but there is no warmth in doing so; and he who earns wages, earns wages to put them into a bag with holes&rdquo; (vv. 4, 6). This means that we will labor much, but the harvest will be little or nothing at all. However, when we are built up together with the saints, the Lord&rsquo;s blessing will flood in and be poured out among us.</p>
<p>While we are serving, we want the church to be blessed, and we also want to bring in the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. The unique condition for bringing in the blessing is for the saints to be built up together. When we are built up, His blessing will come.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Type, and Practice of the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
