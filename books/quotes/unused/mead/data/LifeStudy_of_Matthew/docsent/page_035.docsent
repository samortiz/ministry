   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Place of Recommendation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the place of recommendation was neither in the holy city nor in the holy temple, but in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 1 says that John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness, and verse 3 says, For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, A voice of one crying in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was according to prophecy that John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the introduction of God s New Testament economy by John was not accidental, but planned and foretold by God through Isaiah the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This implies that God intended His New Testament economy to begin in an absolutely new way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you trace the history of the past few centuries, you will see that every prevailing revival took place in some kind of wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When John Wesley and George Whitefield were raised up as evangelists two centuries ago, they mainly did their preaching on the street corners.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to his biography, George Whitefield often preached on the foothills in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, at that time, the Church of England had regulations forbidding the expounding of the Holy Word outside the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to these regulations, anyone who preached or taught from the Bible had to do so in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, God raised up George Whitefield and John Wesley to conduct their preaching outside the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The principle must be the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But this does not mean that we should copy John the Baptist in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It means that we should not take either the religious way or the cultural way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, we must take the way that is full of the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not be in the holy city or in the holy temple, but in a place outside religion and culture, yet in a place full of the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I hope the young people will bring this matter to the Lord and pray, Lord, make us today s John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lord, take us into the wilderness and show us how to be genuine priests to bring others to You and how to introduce You to them as their King.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Gospel of Matthew is absolutely different from the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Gospel of John is a book of life, whereas the Gospel of Matthew is a book of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John Jesus is life, but in Matthew He is the King.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the book of Matthew, the Jesus we are to receive is the King.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we consider the Gospel of Matthew, we must be thoroughly and deeply impressed that we are now in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything written in this book is related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we must look into this book from the angle of the kingdom, viewing every chapter and even every verse from the perspective of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The repentance called for in chapter three is for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must repent because you are not in the kingdom, because you are not under God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must repent because you have not yet submitted to the authority of Christ or come under His kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although you may not feel that you are sinful, as long as you are not in the kingdom, you are a rebellious one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as you have nothing to do with the kingship of Christ, you are in rebellion and must repent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Repent of not being in the kingdom!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The genuine Christians of today are saved, yet many of them still are not in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, even these Christians must repent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as you are not under the kingship of Christ, you must repent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you are not actually in the kingdom of the heavens, not under the heavenly ruling, you must repent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It does not matter how spiritual, holy, or good you are.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The only thing that matters is whether or not you are under the heavenly ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are not, it means that you are not in the kingdom and that you must repent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are not in the kingdom, you are in rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You consider yourself scriptural, fundamental, and holy, but in actuality you are rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even your spirituality is a form of rebellion against the kingship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You care for your spirituality, not for the kingship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that you are in rebellion, that you are not in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Repent of your rebellion!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Repent of not being in the kingdom and of not being under the kingship and authority of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the basic thought of the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not think that Matthew is only for unbelievers, outsiders, or Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many of us have never heard the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I do not know what kind of gospel you have heard, but I do know that you need to hear the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of the kingdom that requires you to repent of not being under the kingship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all must repent to the Lord and say, Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even today I am still in rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am not under Your Lordship, Your authority, Your heavenly ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Lord, I confess that I have been ruled only by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lord, grant me a true repentance for my rebellion, for my not being under Your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all need to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Praise the Lord that John the Baptist and this ministry of the priesthood are still with us!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the one hand, this priesthood brings us to God; on the other hand, it recommends the heavenly King who brings God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we receive this King, He gains us, and the kingdom is here.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
