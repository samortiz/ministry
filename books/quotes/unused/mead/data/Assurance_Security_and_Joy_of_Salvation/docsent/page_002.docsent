   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECURITY OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After a Christian has received the assurance that he is really saved, he may consider, I know that I am saved today, but how do I know that I will be saved tomorrow?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is it possible for me to lose my salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For such a one, it is no longer a question of assurance, but one of security.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A man with millions in the bank has the assurance that the riches are his.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if the bank insists on leaving their vault unlocked, our rich friend will have a real problem with the security of his riches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He knows he is rich today, but he does not know about tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is our salvation like that?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is it something which we have today but may lose at any moment?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The answer is, unequivocally, no. We can boldly say, I know that whatever God does, it will be forever Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One wonderful fact regarding our salvation in Christ is that it is irreversible, that is, it cannot be undone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once we are saved, we are saved forever because our salvation has as its basis the very nature and person of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Salvation Was Initiated by God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jesus told His disciples, You did not choose Me, but I chose you John 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, salvation was God s idea, not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In eternity past we were chosen and even predestinated marked out by Him Eph 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, it was He who called us Rom 8:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since it was God s plan to save us in the first place, it is also His plan to keep us in that salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Could God choose us, mark us out, call us into salvation and then abandon us?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No, God s salvation is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s Love and Grace Are Eternal</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, God s love and grace toward us are not conditional or temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was not love from our side that saved us, but love from His 1 John 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He loved us with an eternal love Jer 31:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His grace was toward us in eternity past, before the world began 2 Tim 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Christ loves us, He loves us to the uttermost John 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No sin, failure, or weakness on our part can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus Rom 8:35-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God Is Righteous</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But our salvation is based not only upon God s love and grace, but even more upon God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our God is a righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne Psa 89:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God were to be unrighteous, His throne would lose its foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, if our salvation in any way involves God s righteousness, it is very strong indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose you run a red light and are given a 25 ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That 25 fine is a righteous penalty, and the law of the land demands that you pay it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a civil judge simply overlooks your offense and releases you without paying, he is an unrighteous judge.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not a matter of whether or not the judge loves you; he is bound by the law to collect the fine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, our problem before God before we were saved was a legal one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We had broken God s law by our sin and had thus incurred the law s righteous judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the law of God, where transgression of the law is, death must take place Rom 6:23; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a matter of God loving us, overlooking our sins, and forgetting about the law s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If God were to do this, His very throne would topple.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is bound by His own law to judge sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What can He do?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since God desired to save us and since we could not pay the debt of sin ourselves, He in His mercy decided to do so Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ, the incarnate God, came to die on the cross to pay the debt for our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Having no sin Himself, He alone was qualified to die this substitutionary death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His death, being reckoned by God as ours, was acceptable to God, and He raised Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now when we believe in Christ, His death is counted in God s sight as our own.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, our debt of sin is righteously paid, and we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now, can God take back this salvation which Christ has purchased?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since the debt was paid, for God to demand it again from us would be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The same righteousness which formerly called for our condemnation now calls for our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What powerful security this gives to our salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even a worldly judge would not demand the same fine to be paid twice.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Certainly God, the source of all justice and righteousness, cannot do so.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As Watchman Nee wrote in a hymn:</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For me forgiveness He has gained,</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And full acquittal was obtained,</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All debts of sin are paid;</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God would not have His claim on two,</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First on His Son, my Surety true,</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And then upon me laid.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, the Bible declares that when God saves us, He shows forth His righteousness Rom 1:16-17; 3:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We Have Become God s Children</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we were saved, we not only received something; we also became something.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We became children of God, born of His eternal life John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A human father may be able to take back a gift he has given to his child, but he can never take back the human life which he has imparted.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although the child may misbehave, the child is still the father s. In the same way, we are God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although we may have many weaknesses and may require His discipline, our sins and weaknesses cannot change the fact that we are His children.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The life we received by our second birth is the eternal life, the indestructible life, the life of God, the life that can never die.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once we are born again, we can never be un-born.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God Is Strong</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Another reason for the security of our salvation is God s strength.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God is unwilling to allow anything or anyone to snatch us from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Jesus said, I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>My Father...is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father s hand John 10:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The hand of the Father and the hand of the Lord Jesus are two strong hands holding us fast.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Even if we try to run away from our Father, it would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Not only is God stronger than Satan, He is also stronger than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God Never Changes</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If it were possible to lose our salvation, many of us would have lost it long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As human beings, we go through many changes.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>One day we are hot; the next, cold.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But our salvation is not based upon our erratic feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is rooted and grounded in a God who is unchanging in His love and faithfulness toward us Mal 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>James 1:17 says, The Father of lights, with whom is no variation or shadow cast by turning.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Lamentations 3:22-23 says, His compassions do not fail; they are new every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Great is Your faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If He loved us enough to save us, He surely loves us enough to keep us in that same salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Great is His faithfulness!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Christ Has Promised</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Finally, Christ Himself has promised to keep us, uphold us, and never leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Although men often are unrighteous in keeping their promises, Christ will never fail to accomplish what He pledges.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Listen to His promise: Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out John 6:37 ; I shall by no means give you up, neither by any means shall I abandon you Heb 13:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Lord s promises here are unconditional.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>By no means, that is, under no circumstances whatever, will He ever cast us out or cease to uphold us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is His faithful promise.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>What powerful security our salvation has!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We have God s selection, His predestination, His calling, His love, His grace, His righteousness, His life, His strength, His unchanging faithfulness, and His promises as the foundation, guaranty, and security of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We can all declare with Paul: I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day 2 Tim 1:12 .</S>
