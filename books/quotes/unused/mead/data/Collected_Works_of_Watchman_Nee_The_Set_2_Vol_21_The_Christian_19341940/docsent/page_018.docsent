   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BAPTISM AND SALVATION Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>5 and 6 Scripture Reading: Mark 16:16; Rom 10:9-10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the mind of many people, Mark 16:16 reads, "He who believes and is saved shall be baptized."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They think that as long as they believe in the Lord, they will be saved, and that after they are saved, they should be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But my Bible does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that it is not enough for a person to believe; he must also be baptized before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have to realize that there are many meanings to the word salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One meaning refers to the blessing in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Another meaning refers to our departure from the world when the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Still another meaning refers to our present overcoming, and a fourth refers to our going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 10 and Mark 16 mean none of the above.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They do not refer to the blessing in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Neither do they refer to the redemption of our body at the coming of the Lord, nor to the salvation of our soul-life in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They refer to something else, something special.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every believer can experience the various aspects of salvation mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I cannot speak on all these today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I heard that someone would be baptized today, I thought about the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I wonder how many people understand the salvation that is spoken of in Romans 10 and Mark 16.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we will spend some time to consider this matter today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is a common thought that one is baptized when he has believed and been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Bible clearly says that he who believes and is baptized is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Baptism comes first, and then salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may ask what this salvation refers to.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please recall how a person receives eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He receives life through believing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He receives eternal life through accepting the Lord Jesus into his heart as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gospel of John clearly speaks of this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although you may have believed, how do I know that you have believed?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although you say that you have received eternal life, how do I know?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose a man has believed, but he never comes to the meeting, never breaks bread with us, and has not been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He continues to be a Christian in secret and lives like the worldly people, without letting anyone know that he is a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I would say that he has life, but that he is not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Truly, he is saved before God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But he is not saved before us and before the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, you have to remember that one aspect of salvation has to do with our separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A man can be a Christian in secret and go to heaven when he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although he may not know what will happen when the Lord comes to judge the believers, he knows that he will have eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But during the fifty or sixty years of his life on earth, he is not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the eyes of the Lord, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, in the eyes of man, he is not saved because even though he has believed, he has not been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, he is still not saved to others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our salvation before the Lord merely gives us His life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we must live out this life so that others can see His life; then we are saved in their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After doing this, other believers will recognize us as brothers, and the Gentiles will call us Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The world will realize that we no longer belong to it, and the brothers will say that we belong with them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we will have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will be freed from the old realm and enter a new realm, and others will sense that we are really separated from them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what is meant by salvation through believing and being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I will take this opportunity today to say a few words while some of you are being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as a person believes in the Lord, he has life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But he must be baptized before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are many Moslems who are Christians in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No one bothers them if they only believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the minute they are baptized, they may even be poisoned to death, because the minute they are baptized, they are saved and separated from the others, and others see a difference in them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They have proven in an outward way that they are Christians and demonstrated the faith that is in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, they can no longer be tolerated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To believe is to have life within, while to be baptized is to be saved without.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When a person is baptized, he demonstrates in an outward way that he belongs to Christ, and others realize that there is a difference in him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why baptism is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Romans 10 says the same thing: "With the mouth there is confession unto salvation" v. 10 . Does this mean that as long as one confesses with his mouth he can go to heaven? Must one confess with his mouth before he can go to heaven? No, there are many dumb ones who can go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Confession with the mouth merely shows those in the world that you are different from them, and that you have been delivered out from their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore brothers, let us pay attention to this aspect of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Numerous Christians have life within, but this life cannot be seen outwardly at all.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although they are saved before the Lord, before their friends, brothers, family, and colleagues, they are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I can illustrate this with an example.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The last time I took a boat on a journey, I talked with many passengers on the boat who asked me what my line of business was.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It was difficult for me to explain to them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What could I say?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I could not say that I was a preacher, because I do not recognize this as a profession or as a special class of people.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I could not say that I was a Christian, because a Christian is not a profession or business; saying this would not be answering what they had asked.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Later, I thought about the fact that I wrote many articles, and I told them that I was a writer.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But the minute I said this, I became as one who was not saved among them, because I did not show others my difference.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I became the same as they were.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>One could be a reporter, another a cashier or bookkeeper, while I was a writer.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this way, all of us became the same.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In their eyes, I was not a person being delivered from among them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I could have been different from them by following my statement with the words: "I am a Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This would have marked a clear boundary between them and me, and would have shown them that they were sinners, while I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They and I were totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Truly, we may be saved, but others may not know that we are saved; they may think that we are the same as them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the meaning of the verse, "With the mouth there is confession unto salvation."</S>
