   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FEW WORDS TO THOSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHO ARE NOT CLEAR ABOUT SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have to say a few words to those who are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is an undeniable fact that we cannot improve the world and God will judge it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How are you going to escape God's judgment?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was pitch within and without the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word pitch is the same word as redemption in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, pitch signifies redemption or propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ark was pitched within and without, which is a type of the Lord's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Redemption is brought in by the blood of the Lord Jesus, and the lives of all those who are in the ark are preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The flood was outside the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The world was filled with the flood, and it was dying because of the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet within the ark everything was living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All punishment has fallen on Christ, the ark; it is no longer on us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The only way for those who desire peace, forgiveness, and deliverance is to enter into the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if the world were to make ten thousand ships, it would be to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The world was filled with God's judgment, yet the ark was pitched within.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a type of the redemptive work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The ark was also pitched without, which also is a type of the redemptive work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are inside the ark, God's judgment will not come upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose there is a person, let us say that she is Japheth's wife, or Noah's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose she is weeping inside the ark, saying, "What will we do if the ark leaks and sinks?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We would all laugh at her.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let me ask: If you acknowledge the redemptive work of Christ and believe that His crucifixion on the cross is for your redemption, why are you afraid to declare that you are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why are you still restless?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may consider what would happen if the blood of the Lord Jesus became ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You should ask yourself at this hour if you have truly believed, and if you have truly put your faith in the accomplished work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Would the ark leak?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A person once came to Mr. D. L. Moody with tears on his cheeks.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Mr. Moody asked him for the reason, he said, "I am afraid of perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But what should I do to save myself from perdition?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Mr. Moody told him the Scripture says that those who believe have eternal life, and that he who comes to the Lord will not be rejected, and that God will save to the uttermost those who come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He used similar texts to talk to the man for two to three hours, but the man's problem was still not resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He continued to say, "I have indeed believed in the Lord, but I am still afraid that I will perish."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Mr. Moody then said, "You remind me of one of Noah's daughters-in-law, who perhaps wept within the ark for fear of the ark leaking." The man said, "Sir, how can that be? The ark would never leak." Mr. Moody then answered, "You are the person who is weeping inside the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You are afraid that the ark will leak."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When that man heard this, he became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus is able to save to the uttermost all those who come to God through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It does not matter whether you are wise or foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether or not you are saved depends on whether you are inside the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It has nothing to do with whether you are intelligent or foolish, rich or poor.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>None of these things counts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The only question is whether or not you are inside the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only those who enter the ark through the work of Christ are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The number of people who enter the ark will be the same number that come out of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The number of lives within the ark is the number of lives preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you want to be a genuine Christian, you have to be within the ark; you cannot remain on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You cannot be saved by your own works.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You must declare to the Lord: "Everything that is of the world has nothing to do with me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I stand on Your side."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Salvation is accomplished once you enter the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Unfortunately, many people have only believed in the Lord; they have not cut off all ties with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, you must not only be faithful to serve God, but you must be faithful to do what you testified at the time of your baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Baptism cannot save a person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Salvation comes through the Lord's death and resurrection alone.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, baptism is an expression of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The blood of the Lord Jesus saves you into God's presence, while the water of baptism saves you out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even if you forget everything that we have spoken of today, as long as you can remember the difference between these two salvations, it will be good enough.</S>
