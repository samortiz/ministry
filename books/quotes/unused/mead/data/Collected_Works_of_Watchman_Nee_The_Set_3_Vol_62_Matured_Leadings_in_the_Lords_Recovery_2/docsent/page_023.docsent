   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SUBJECT OF ROMANS THE PURE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>F. W. Grant said that the book of Romans is a complete and accurate thesis on the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everything spoken of in this book is an argument and counterpoint against any possible objection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more precious and fundamental a truth is, the more men will summon their wisdom to overthrow it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul uses this Epistle to defend the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The subject of Romans is the pure gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, it points out that both the Gentiles and the Jews are under sin and cannot stand before the judgment seat of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Next, Paul points out God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the very thing that a condemned sinner is afraid of, but it becomes the very shelter and protection to an enlightened sinner when Christ's sacrificial work is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By faith we are justified, and God's righteousness become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This gospel not only forgives the sinner of his sins, but secures a new position for the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first part of Romans reveals the power of the blood which Christ shed for the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we believe in Him, our sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Christ resurrected, the believers were justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We stand on new ground in Christ and experience God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once a man receives this precious gospel, he can do nothing but preach it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Grant is one of the most famous Bible expositors.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Darby is also an able expositor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The former is short in stature while the latter is tall.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is another one, Frederick Louis Godet, who was an orthodox theologian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He represented the continental European school of theology.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was also a very spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One brother said that the King James Version does not pay much attention to the difference between Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The same is true with Darby's translation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Yu: The Greeks spoke of peace in their salutation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But Paul spoke of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He spoke about his ministry and calling first because he did not know the Christians in Rome that well, and he had to recommend himself and declare his status.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word slave is used also in Galatians 3:28 and 1 Timothy 6:1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Watchman Nee: Martin Luther said that the word slave denotes modesty and majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Revelation 22 John wanted to worship the angel, but the angel said that he was a fellow slave vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a glory to be a slave of Jesus Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word serve in Greek denotes a respectful and willing service.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This word is used to describe the service of the prophets and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The service of a slave is the lowliest and meanest work; it is a work that unties others' sandals.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Paul said that he was a slave of Jesus Christ, he had the same spirit as that of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The expression the gospel of God does not merely mean that the gospel speaks of God or that it is about God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, it means that the gospel is established by God and initiated by Him cf.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rom 15:16; 1 Thes 2:2, 8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>CALLED TO BE A STEWARD OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul was a slave of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul testified that he was happy to render his service to the Lord as a slave bought by the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the same time, he was an apostle appointed by God and called by Him unto the service of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Like it or not, he was separated unto the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was not solicited by God; he was drafted by Him into the army.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was drafted and enrolled to meet God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the reason Paul was called to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Being separated means being set apart from all men, things, and events, and being made different.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This separation happens in three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First, in Galatians 1:15 we are told that Paul was separated by God from his mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is like the firstborn of Israel being separated unto God in the Old Testament Exo 13:12; 22:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Second, in Acts 26:16-18 Paul was separated by the Lord to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This proves Romans 1:1 which speaks of being separated unto the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Third, in Acts 13:2, he and Barnabas were separated by the Holy Spirit unto the work that He had prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In these three separations, Paul was called by the Father, the Son, and the Spirit respectively, and all the separations were for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The word gospel means the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the sum total of the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first eight chapters of Romans deal with the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Chapters one through five cover the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Chapters nine through eleven cover God's selection, which relates to His sovereignty in His divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From chapter twelve onward, the book covers the fellowship of the church and various guidelines related to it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul was called unto this gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This does not mean that he was called to speak at the podium, but that he was called to be the steward of the entire gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He labored and endeavored for the entire gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Next time, before we come together again, we have to digest all the reference materials at home first.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We cannot wait until we are here to digest the material.</S>
