<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF MIGRATION</h2><p>Since the publication of the fourth issue of The Ministers, many of God's children seem to have a feeling concerning migration. We have already received many letters asking about the matter of migration. We will now answer them as follows:</p><p>1) The meaning of migration: Migration is a term used in the world. In the Bible migration is to "get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee" (Gen. 12:1; cf. Acts 7:3).</p><p>2) The goal of migration: It is to preach the gospel to all the nations and to be the Lord's witnesses to the uttermost parts of the earth (Matt. 28:19; Acts 1:8).</p><p>3) The requirements for migration: We must have an inward burden for the gospel and a will to suffer. We must be willing to absolutely obey and to give our all for the gospel. If we do not give up everything, migration is not only meaningless, but a joyless suffering, and can even put us into turmoil.</p><p>4) The preparations for migration: First, there is the spiritual preparation. We must resolve the matter of our consecration. All should live for the Lord and His gospel whether in life or death, through sweetness or bitterness. We must have a strong, thorough consecration. Second, there is preparation for the work. In our own locality we must first learn to preach the gospel, visit sinners, and do the individual work of leading people to the Lord. Third, there is the preparation of practical affairs. We must learn something about how to manage the church finances, care for the brothers and sisters, arrange baptisms, and accept people at the table meeting. Fourth, there is the preparation of our livelihood. We must be prepared to take up a skilled trade (such as barber, cobbler, tailor, toothpaste maker, soap maker, chandler, weaver, coppersmith, farmer, or rancher). Those who migrate must engage in some form of production work. We must be able to at least support ourselves, and it is better if we can contribute to the support of others. The worst thing that can happen is for a person to migrate not for the gospel but for solving his personal problem with his livelihood. Some may even think that if they migrate, they will not have to work again and others will take care of their living.</p><p>5) The areas for migration: We must be certain that we migrate to places with people to whom we can preach the gospel. Do not migrate to the wilderness or a valley in the mountains where there is no one to hear the gospel. Thus, we should first concentrate on the areas with big cities. If there are brothers and sisters who want to migrate, it would be most appropriate for them to go to Shenyang or Ch'ang-ch'un in Manchuria; Sian, Lanchow, or Tihua in the Northwest; Hankow, Chungking, or Ch'eng-tu along the Yangtze River; and Kweichow or K'un-ming in the Southwest. It is best if we are able to first contact the church in the locality we want to migrate to and make some arrangements.</p><p>6) The practice of migration: It is all right if we want to go out alone. If the brothers and sisters can go out corporately, it is best if they have all things in common and work together in one accord for the gospel. (Anyone who has not made a thorough consecration and does not meet the requirements for migration should absolutely not be part of a group which has all things in common.) If we cannot live with all things in common, but want to migrate individually, then it is best if we migrate to a locality with a church. At the same time, if there are members of our family who do not agree with us, do not force migration on them. We must put it into the Lord's hands and wait with patience for the Lord's arrangement in our environment.</p><p>7) The result of migration: Those who migrate for the sake of the gospel in this way are Christians who have been uprooted from the world. They are consecrated Christians, those who love the Lord. Another result of migration is the spread of the gospel.</p><p>May God strengthen the way of migration so that all the brothers and sisters in all the churches would be able to give and expend their all for the total outreach of the gospel. For the sake of carrying the gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth, it is right for each church to have fifty to one hundred brothers and sisters coordinating together to migrate to various places. If we practice this, the glorious dawning will soon be here!</p><p>Chang Yu-zhi<br />May 3, 1950</p>
