<h2 class="head1">EXPLANATION AND FELLOWSHIP</h2> 
<ol class="decimal">
<li>These lessons have been specifically prepared for the home meetings of new believers. The first two volumes cover different matters between a believer and God which he should know, understand, and practice immediately after his salvation. Then the last two volumes cover the full salvation which God has prepared in Christ for us who have believed into Him, the riches which we have obtained in Christ, the experience which we should have in Christ, the things which we should accomplish in Christ, and the goal which we should attain in Christ.</li> 
<li>It is difficult to avoid certain terms which are relatively deep and hard for new believers to understand. There is no need for added explanation while reading these lessons in the meetings. As lesson after lesson is read, a thorough understanding of the terms will be acquired. Even if there is not such a thorough understanding at the time, this understanding will be gained gradually.</li> 
<li>Knowledge is empty and the letter kills; only Christ is reality and only the Spirit gives life. Thus, there must be prayer, confession of sins, and the abundantly rich filling and saturation with the Spirit of Christ before reading these lessons. In reading, there should be the practice of depending less on the mind and more on the spirit, rejecting the old way of knowledge and emphasizing the new way of life. Sentence after sentence that is being read should be pushed out by the spirit with life that others&rsquo; spirits may be touched for them to receive the life supply of the pneumatic Christ.</li> 
<li>The Bible verses in these lessons are quoted in an economical and suitable way. Furthermore, their explanations are both concise and adequate, having no need for further explanation. The only need is to repeat what is read, to emphasize what is read, to read in a living way, and to pray-read. At times, the reading should be supplemented by hymns or testimonies. Never extend the meaning of the text or develop an understanding based on inference.</li>
<li>The Scriptures quoted in these lessons are from the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the King James Version of the Old Testament.</li>
<li>For these lessons to be beneficial to the home meetings, there is a great need for much prayer. May the Lord bless His recovery, perfect His saints, and build up His Body.</li>
