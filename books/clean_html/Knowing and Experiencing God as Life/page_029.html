<h2 class="head1">GOD BECOMING THE SECOND MAN</h2>
<p>It seemed that the man whom God created for Himself was destroyed by Satan. Man has a record of sin before God, and he has sinful deeds without and a sinful nature within. Man, seemingly, is completely lost. However, God would not stop. It does not matter what His enemy does; God will carry out His intention. Hence, He became flesh and put on the human nature to be a man. God did not enter into humanity in an ordinary way. He was begotten in a virgin by the Holy Spirit. Although He was a genuine man, possessing human nature, He was not contaminated with the sin of the flesh (Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). He had a human body with its human nature, but He was not contaminated by the sin within the fallen human nature.</p>
<p>God entered into humanity to be a man. First Corinthians 15:47 calls Him the second man. Adam and his descendants are included in the first man. The first man, Adam, was injected with the poison of sin, and he has sinful deeds and a record of sin before God. Every man is included in the first man. When the first man sinned, all men were constituted sinners (Rom. 5:18-19). No matter what a person&rsquo;s age may be, he has been sinning for six thousand years in Adam. When Adam sinned, all men sinned.</p>
<p>The Bible has a wonderful way of calculating matters concerning man. According to Hebrews 7:9-10, when Abraham gave one-tenth of the spoil to Melchizedek, the king of Salem, Levi, an offspring in the loins of Abraham, was paying tithes as well. While Abraham was offering tithes, his fourth-generation descendant was also offering tithes. This is the way the Bible calculates matters concerning man. In the same principle, when Adam sinned, all his descendants sinned with him. Hence, the entire adamic race has received the poison of Satan, has committed sinful deeds, and has a record of sin. The first man, including all of us who are in him, is completely defiled.</p>
<p>Then God came. He put on human nature, had a human body, and possessed the form of a man. God became a man. He is the second man. The second man is joined to the first man, but He does not have the sinful nature of the first man. This is wonderful.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 15:45, God became &ldquo;the last Adam.&rdquo; The first Adam was created by God, but God Himself became the second man and the last Adam. One was a matter of creation, and the other was a becoming. These two men are joined to each other in their outward physical form and in their inward God-created human nature but not in the sinful nature. The second man had the likeness of the flesh of sin but not the sinful nature. Thus, in the second man the Creator is mingled with created man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TEST OF THE LAW</h2>
<p>Before becoming a man, God used various ways over a period of four thousand years to expose man, showing him that he is corrupt, sinful, evil, and unable to save himself. During this time, the law was the last means that God used to test and to prove man so that man would know that he is sinful, corrupt, and utterly unable to overcome sin.</p>
<p>Seemingly, God wanted man to keep the law, but this was not His intention. This part of the Old Testament is difficult to understand. In Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy there are many words that require man to keep the law. God seemed to say, &ldquo;If you keep the law, you will be blessed, but if you break the law, you will be cursed.&rdquo; Such words suggest that God wanted man to keep the law. However, if we touch the spirit of the Old Testament, we will see that God had no intention for man to keep the law. He knew that man could not keep the law. He knew that man would break the law and violate it, but He used the law to show man his wicked, evil, and hopeless inward condition. The law can be compared to a mirror that enables a person to see his condition. Parents know that children like to play in the dirt. A child&rsquo;s face might be covered with dirt, but he will not acknowledge that he is dirty. The best way for parents to show a child that he needs to be washed is to give the child a mirror. As soon as the child looks in the mirror, he will understand that he needs to be washed. There is no need for an adult to give any explanation. The law is a mirror to expose man&rsquo;s sins. Regrettably, when man receives the law, he mistakenly thinks that God wants him to obey the law. Therefore, man tries his best to obey the law. However, the more he tries, the more he fails. The more he tries to not break the law, the more he breaks it. Through God&rsquo;s use of the law, man is convinced, subdued, and silenced.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S LIVING ON THE EARTH</h2>
<p>God became a man. The Lord Jesus was a genuine man possessing the human life and nature. However, He possessed not only the human life but also the divine life; that is, He had God with His human life. The Lord did not live by His human life but by God&rsquo;s life. He lived only before God and in God, and He took God as His life. He did not care for the law and never placed Himself solely under the obligation of the law. This does not mean that He violated the law. His living not only met the requirement of the law but even fulfilled and complemented that which was lacking in the law (Matt. 5:17). Nevertheless, there was no sense that He was merely keeping the law; rather, He was expressing God. While the Lord Jesus was on earth, He did not live by His life but by taking God as life. Furthermore, He was obligated not merely to the law but to God. He did not live merely under the law; He lived in God. The Lord&rsquo;s living was not the life of a man keeping the moral standard of the law. His living was an expression of God; God was manifested in His living.</p>
<p>The living of the Lord Jesus on the earth was a model, showing how all human beings should live. A proper person should deny the self and live by taking God as life and by letting God live in him. Furthermore, a proper person should not be obligated to anything except to God. This was the living of the man Jesus, as shown in the Gospels. God desires to work this model into His people so that they may, like the Son, deny their soul-life, take God as life, and be obligated only to God, not to the law. God wants to work this model into us.</p>
