   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having a Burden and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Shepherding the Saints with a Parent s Heart</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>An elder may say that he cannot speak the word because he has not received much training and does not know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose there is a co-worker in a nearby church who knows the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It may not be beneficial for the elder to invite him to speak the word, because the co-worker may not have a burden for that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Speaking the word must come out of a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to be effective, a person must be burdened to work until a fire in the saints is kindled.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our speaking is to enliven the saints and cause them to be burning for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not have a burden, we should not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The elders are obligated to feed the flock; they are like parents with children.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the elders have such a heart, the situation in the church will change.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some brothers may ask how to prepare a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our publications are very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should study the publications and select portions that will meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot rely on others to do this for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the responsibility of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This responsibility will also make the elders more useful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Knowing the Needs of the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our weakness has been that we have the concept that it is the full-time co-workers who are specialized in giving messages.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our concept is that the co-workers, not the elders, are responsible for speaking the word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must change this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the elders are willing to endeavor, they will be very effective when they speak the word, because they know the needs of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They may not be eloquent, but they will be very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There was a brother in northern China who was a good speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, after giving good messages for four years, he did not reap much result.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There was also a brother who did not know how to give messages and was not eloquent, but he established the church in Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he went to Tsingtao in 1934, there were no brothers there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Fourteen years later more than seven hundred people had been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although this brother was not a good speaker, his messages were practical.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He administrated and led the church, and he knew the needs of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to meet the need of the saints, he studied and prepared his messages.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the saints needed a word on redemption, he studied and prepared a message on redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way the saints received the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, the church was built up in a very solid way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Messages that are lofty and nice do not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as we are willing to make an effort, there will be results.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The elders indeed need to devote more time to their service.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some elders should even serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First Timothy 5:17 says, Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that elders who serve full time should be honored and should receive material support.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some elders should devote all their time to administrating the church, and some brothers who serve full time should get a job.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the function of a full-time brother is not manifested, he should not waste his time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He should do something else.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, some elders should give all their time to care for and administrate the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The principle is that the elders are like parents or older siblings in a family.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They ensure that everyone in the family is fed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The elders should do the work of shepherding and feeding; they must not rely solely on the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The co-workers who are useful should set aside some time for the spreading of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A co-worker who stays in one locality is tied down by that local church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In principle, this may not be profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>OVERSEEING Entrusting and Overseeing</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The elders in the church should first shepherd the saints and then oversee them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that after shepherding the saints, the elders should entrust them with some services.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not merely to teach the saints but to put things into their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After entrusting the saints with a service, the elders should then oversee.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This means that the elders should take their hands off and let the saints be responsible for giving suggestions and making decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The elders should not make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose a brother is assigned to the young people s work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The elders no longer need to take care of the young people s work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They should let the brother bear the work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The elders should only oversee.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If every matter in the church is handed over to the saints, the function of the saints will be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the saints are assigned to a service, they should be in charge of everything, and the elders no longer need to manage that service.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should train the saints to be responsible for their service.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then the elders and co-workers will only be overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is not proper for the co-workers and elders to keep everything in their pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A proper elder is an overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more responsibilities he has, the more he should delegate and oversee.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this way he will bring the saints into the service.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some brothers are concerned that the saints will make mistakes when we let them serve.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should not be so concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The churches in Taiwan are established; consequently, even if the saints make a mistake, it will not be serious.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When the saints make a mistake, we should assist them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is more effective and will help the saints to participate in the service.</S>
