BEING ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>After Galatians 1 through 4, the emphasis of chapter 5 is no longer on the law, ordinances, religion, and traditions. Rather, this chapter speaks of walking by the Spirit, living by the Spirit, and being led by the Spirit (vv. 16, 25, 18). It is difficult for translators of the Bible to decide whether <em>Spirit</em> refers to the Holy Spirit or to our human spirit. According to the context, the Spirit here is the Holy Spirit, who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit. Again, we may use a hand in a glove as an illustration. The gloved hand is neither a hand alone nor simply a glove, because the two have become one. Christ as the divine Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, is mingled with our spirit. As we have seen, Christ is revealed in us, He lives in us, we have put Him on, and He is now being formed in us. As a result, we two are one; He becomes us, and we become Him. The Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit is mingled with our spirit to be one spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:16). This oneness is not a matter of our natural mind, heart, or flesh but of the Spirit in our spirit, as 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; He and we, we and He, are now one spirit.</p>
<p>Now, whatever we do, we must do it in the mingled spirit. We leave behind all the negative things&mdash;the law, ordinances, religion, traditions, and the flesh&mdash;and we remain in the mingled spirit. This is why after Galatians deals with so many negative matters, the last portion of chapter 5 emphasizes only the Spirit. Day by day we need to walk by the Spirit in our spirit, be led by the Spirit, and have our life in the Spirit. We do not need to ask whether we should do one thing or the other. We must simply walk by the Spirit and be led by Him. If the Spirit leads one way, we do that, but if He leads another way, we do that instead. Many years ago when brothers and sisters would come to ask me for advice, I would have much to say to them. However, today I am much simpler. If someone asks me to fellowship with them for half an hour, I am often clear that the answer to their question will take closer to half a minute. The answer to many questions is simply, &ldquo;Go according to the Spirit in your spirit.&rdquo; If we would do everything according to the Spirit in our spirit, we will be freed from problems and saved from turmoil.</p>
<p>Many dear ones ask me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, your burden is so heavy. Are you afflicted and have many worries?&rdquo; On the contrary, I remain joyful and healthy. Worry comes not from the spirit but from the mind. Similarly, anger comes from our emotions. If we remain in our mind, worries come to us, and if we stay in our emotions, we become bothered and lose our temper. However, if we walk by the Spirit, all our worries and anger are gone.</p>
<p>The traditional teachings of Christianity have made the experience of Christ to appear too complicated. Instead, it is very simple. We may compare the Spirit in our spirit to electricity. Once electricity is installed in a building, the building has whatever we need. If we need heat, we can plug in a heater, and if we need light, we can simply flip a switch. Christ as the Spirit today is the &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; within us, providing us with everything that we need, and our spirit is the &ldquo;switch&rdquo; to turn Him on within us. We must be unloaded of all our negative burdens. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we must not care for the law, ordinances, religion, traditions, or the flesh. We care only for Christ as the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit, causing these two spirits to be one. We can turn on the &ldquo;switch&rdquo; of our spirit by calling on His name to enjoy Him as the divine electricity.</p>

BY PRAYING IN THE MINGLED SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When I was young, I would buy many books, especially expositions of the Bible. Whenever I studied a certain part of the Bible, I would spread out my books on my desk, my bed, and even on the floor. I also used different Greek lexicons and concordances of the Bible. I liked to compare, investigate, study, search, and research in this way. Today, however, I prefer to open the Word, choose a few verses, and enjoy them by praying in the mingled spirit. When we pick up Galatians, we may pray, &ldquo;There are no more ordinances. Amen. No more law. Amen. No more religion. Amen. There is only Christ revealed in me, living in me, put upon me, and formed in me. Amen. Today this Christ is the Spirit in my spirit. Oh, these two spirits are mingled as one. Hallelujah!&rdquo; By praying in this way we will receive much nourishment.</p>
<p>Some Christians today do not pray enough, but others pray with too many stories for the Lord and many details concerning persons, places, activities, and intentions. Our Father in heaven already knows the things that we need. Therefore, we should forsake the way of telling the Lord stories. To pray in this way is tiring, and it wastes the Lord&rsquo;s time and ours. If someone prays like this, he may even become bored with his prayer. On the one hand, he will feel that he needs to pray, but on the other hand, his prayer will be burdensome. Eventually, he may go for a long time with no prayer at all. Then he will say, &ldquo;Father, I repent. I did not pray for three weeks. Forgive me. From today on, I will recover my prayer life.&rdquo; After this, he will begin to pray again, but he will do it in the same, old way. This is the practice of the law, ordinances, religion, traditions, and the flesh. Even when we come to the dining table, we may give a word of grace in a traditional way, praying in the same way time after time. This also is a practice of religion. We need to drop the old way of prayer. When we come to eat, we may simply feel to say, &ldquo;Amen! Praise the Lord!&rdquo;</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Enjoying Christ as the All-inclusive Spirit for the Practical, Genuine, and Real Church Life &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
