All Those Who Were Being Oppressed by the Devil</h2>
<p>He defeated the devil in the devil&rsquo;s temptation. From that time onward, He was going about to do good and to heal all those who were being oppressed by the devil (Acts 10:38b). He defeated the devil first; then He went out to defeat the devil for the release of the oppressed ones.</p>
<h2 class="head4">i. Announcing the Gospel to the Poor</h2>
<p>Christ announced the gospel to the poor, proclaiming release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, and sending away in release those who are oppressed (Luke 4:18-19).</p>
<h2 class="head4">j. Announcing Justice to the Gentiles</h2>
<p>Matthew 12:18b says that He announced justice to the Gentiles. <em>Justice</em> here refers to the all-inclusive Christ. If you have Christ, you have justice and peace. With injustice there is no peace and satisfaction. The nations of the world are struggling and fighting against one another because of injustice. None of them is satisfied. Justice means Christ is satisfying you. When we have Christ, we are satisfied, and our conflict with others is terminated. When we are announcing Christ as everything to people, Christ satisfies them and brings them justice. If there is a feeling of injustice between you and someone else, this indicates you are short of Christ. You need to receive more of Christ; then justice is there.</p>
<h2 class="head4">k. Casting Out Demons by the Spirit of God</h2>
<p>By the Spirit of God, Christ cast out demons for the coming of the kingdom of God (Matt. 12:28).</p>
<h2 class="head4">l. Witnessing God Faithfully</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:5 and 3:14 say that Christ is the faithful Witness. His expressing God was His witnessing. Many people wondered who He was. This man was God, witnessing God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">m. Justified in the Spirit</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:16 says that He was justified in the Spirit. He was opposed, persecuted, and rejected by man, but He was justified in the Spirit. As One who was in the Spirit, He could not be condemned or criticized by anyone.</p>
<h2 class="head4">n. Through the Eternal Spirit,<br />
</em><em>He Offered Himself without Blemish to God</h2>
<p>Through the eternal Spirit, He offered Himself without blemish to God that He may purify our conscience with His blood from dead works to serve the living God (Heb. 9:14). For Christ to offer Himself to God to be crucified to accomplish redemption to bring us back to serve the living God was a great thing. This was difficult for Him in His humanity as seen by His prayer at Gethsemane. He prayed three times for the Father, if possible, to remove the cup of death from Him, but He ended by praying, &ldquo;Yet not as I will, but as You will&rdquo; (Matt. 26:39-44). That indicates that even He, Christ in the flesh, was suffering something that was not so easy for His humanity. He realized the need of the strengthening of the Spirit, so He offered Himself, including His humanity, to God through the eternal Spirit. What He accomplished in His redemption was eternal, because that was done through the eternal Spirit. This indicates that He did everything through the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Accomplishment of God&rsquo;s Eternal Economy<br />
in the God-man&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The God-man as God&rsquo;s anointed One, Messiah, Christ, moved under the anointing of the Spirit of God. This was the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy in the God-man&rsquo;s ministry while He was in the flesh and on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Living by the Father and Moving by the Spirit</h2>
<p>Christ as the first God-man on the one hand lived by the Father, who abode and worked in Him (John 14:10), and on the other hand moved and ministered by the Spirit. John 14:10 says, &ldquo;Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.&rdquo; This proves that while Christ was working, the Father was working in Him by abiding in Him. His living by the Father and ministering by the Spirit indicate that the living of the first God-man was actually the living and moving of the processed Triune God in Christ&rsquo;s human living on the earth.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
