<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>T. All of the Above Points<br>under the Teaching of the Dissenting Ones<br>Becoming Winds of Teaching Which Have Caused<br>Divisions in the Lord's Recovery</H2><P>All of the above points under the teaching of the dissenting ones have become winds of teaching which have caused divisions in the Lord's recovery (Eph. 4:14). These winds of teaching have caused divisions in the following places in California&#151;Rosemead, Anaheim, Huntington Beach, San Diego, South San Francisco, Cupertino, and Lomita. There is also a division in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. According to the Bible, there is no base, no reason, no excuse, no justification, and no vindication for any kind of division.</P><P>There are three things the church cannot tolerate: division, heresies, and immorality. Divisions damage the Body of Christ. Heresies insult the person of Christ and damage the work of Christ. Immorality damages the humanity of people who were made by God to be the members of the Body of Christ. In Romans 14 and 15 Paul charged us to receive all the believers, embracing all the differences. But in Romans 16 he said, "Now I exhort you, brothers, to mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them" (v. 17). Concerning the divisive ones, Paul was very definite and strict. His teaching concerning these divisive ones was also very straight. He exhorted the saints to turn away from anyone who made divisions.</P><P>Ephesians 4:14 says, "That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error." Any teaching, even a scriptural one, that distracts believers from Christ and the church is a wind of teaching that carries believers away from God's central purpose. The only way to escape the waves that are stirred up by the winds of teaching is to grow in life, and the safe way to grow in life is to stay in the proper church life with Christ and the church as the safeguard.</P>
