Advising the People of Judah<br>to Listen to His Word<br>and Turn from Their Evil Way</H2><P>Jeremiah advised the people of Judah, including the priests and the prophets, to listen to his word and to turn from their evil way (vv. 3-7). Otherwise, Jehovah would make the temple like Shiloh (7:12-14; 1 Sam. 4:10-11) and the city of Jerusalem a curse to all the nations of the earth.
