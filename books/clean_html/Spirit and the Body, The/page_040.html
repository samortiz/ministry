<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GLORIFICATION</H2><P>Eventually, we shall all be glorified (Rom. 8:30). Glorification is like the blossoming of a carnation flower. As a carnation grows, the life within shapes it into the form of a carnation. One day, spontaneously, it blossoms. That is the glorification of the carnation. Glorification is the ultimate consummation of transformation and conformation. Presently we are undergoing the process of transformation and conformation. This will continue until we reach the consummation&#151;glorification. In that glorification, the transfiguration of our body, we shall be exactly the same as the firstborn Son in spirit, soul, and body. At that time we shall know for certain that we are the many sons, and Christ may say, "I am the firstborn, and you are the many sons." We shall actually be the same as He (1 John 3:2). This is the work of the all- inclusive Spirit within us. This is sanctification, life impartation, transformation, conformation, and glorification. We are in this process today.</P><P>When you hear this, you may wonder what you should do. Forget your doing and just rest. As this process goes on, you will be sanctified, you will enjoy the impartation of life, you will undergo the work of transformation, you will be conformed to the image of the firstborn, and ultimately you will be brought into glorification. This is the church life. Instead of trying to do something, simply enjoy the Lord, call on His name, and praise Him. Although we should not try to improve ourselves, we do need to exercise our spirit to experience the wonderful all-inclusive Spirit. The more we do this, the more we shall experience sanctification, the impartation of life, transformation, conformation, and eventually glorification.</P>
