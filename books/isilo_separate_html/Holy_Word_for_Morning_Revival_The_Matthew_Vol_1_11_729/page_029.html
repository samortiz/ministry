Their influence issues from their nature. In verse 13 the Lord said, &#8220;You are the salt of the earth,&#8221; and in verse 14 He said, &#8220;You are the light of the world.&#8221; The &#8220;you&#8221; in these two verses does not refer to an individual, but to a corporate people. The kingdom people as the salt kill the germs of corruption and preserve the God-created earth. Moreover, as a city on a mountain, they are the light effacing the world&#8217;s darkness, and as a lamp uncovered, they shine to all who are in the house.</p><p>The third section of the King&#8217;s word on the mountain (5:17-48) concerns the law of the kingdom people. There are three aspects of the law: 1) the principle, 2) the commandments, and 3) the rituals. The principle of the law was replaced in the dispensation of grace with the principle of faith. Likewise, the rituals-offering sacrifices and keeping the Sabbath-were also terminated because they were part of the old dispensation of shadows, figures, and types, all of which have been fulfilled by Christ as the reality. Concerning the commandments of the law, they were uplifted, complemented, and completed by the Lord&#8217;s coming (v. 17).</p><p>Our entrance into the kingdom of God requires regeneration (John 3:3, 5), but entrance into the kingdom of the heavens demands surpassing righteousness (Matt. 5:20) in our living after regeneration. Such righteousness can only be produced by the higher, resurrection life of Christ.</p><p>In Matthew 5:22 we have the judgment of the believers. This thought of being burned by fire is found in both 1 Corinthians 3 and Hebrews 6. Revelation 2:11 implies that the defeated Christians will be hurt by the second death, the lake of fire. Although believers are forgiven by God forever, they are still liable to the Lord&#8217;s judgment, not for perdition but for discipline, if they sin against the new law of the kingdom as given here. However, if we sin, we will be forgiven and cleansed by the blood of the Lord Jesus if we repent and confess our sins (1 John 1:7, 9).</p><p>Two crucial matters are seen in Matthew 5:23-26. First, with our brother, if, as we come to contact the Lord, we have the sense that a brother or sister has a complaint against us, we must stop our fellowship with the Lord and go to this one and be reconciled. Then we may come back to continue our fellowship with the Lord. Second, with our opponent, we should be reconciled to our opponent before we die, before he dies, or before the Lord comes back. If we do not take care of any matter now, we shall have to deal with it in the coming age.</p><p>In verses 27 through 30, the Lord spoke about murder and adultery. Murder refers to our temper, and adultery to our lust. In order to live up to the high standard of the new law, we need another life. We must contact Christ daily, hourly, and moment by moment. As Romans 8:13 reveals, by the Spirit we must &#8220;put to death the practices of the body,&#8221; and, as Colossians 3:5 says, we must mortify our &#8220;members which are on the earth.&#8221;</p><p>Finally, in verses 31 through 48, the four laws regarding divorce, swearing, resisting evil, and loving our enemies have all been changed. All these laws touch our being and put us on the cross. Only by living Christ who is the resurrection life within our spirit will the righteous requirement of the law be fulfilled in us.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
