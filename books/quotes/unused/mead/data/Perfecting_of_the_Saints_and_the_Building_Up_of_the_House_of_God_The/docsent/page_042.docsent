   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE OUR USEFULNESS IN THE LORD S HAND THE NEED OF THE LITERATURE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The saints who labor in the literature work need a proper understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It may seem that the work done in the editorial room is insignificant, but it is greater than the work of speaking from the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We distributed over one hundred forty thousand copies of the pamphlet concerning how to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This shows that the literature work is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we should not despise the work in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The editorial room may seem small, but the work is not small.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Washington, D. C., there was a Chinese sister who met with us, and she asked where she could find messages that were similar to the ones that she had heard.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This sister attended meetings in different places but had never heard messages like the ones in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our messages touched her inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason she asked where she could find more messages.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I referred her to the Gospel Book Room in Taipei and told her that it published many books and had recently printed a pamphlet on how to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I also wrote the Book Room and requested that some copies of The Ministry of the Word magazine and books on the enjoyment of God be sent to her.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a short time, she received the publications.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since she did not want to receive the books for free, she made a small payment to the Book Room.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a letter to me she wrote, Among the so-called spiritual books in this age, one can rarely find words that shine forth so brightly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I pray that the Lord will use you and that your books will be translated into many languages to enlighten and satisfy the hungry ones everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After you left, my husband was saved, and he now meets with some brothers once a week to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I thank the Lord that we have His presence, oneness, and sweet fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The brothers and sisters are praying for you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This testimony should burden us to pray for the literature work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The brothers and sisters who are laboring in the literature work should be encouraged by the great and urgent need among Christians and by their positive response to our literature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the reason that we should translate some of the important messages into English.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>People in Japan also understand English.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We met a Japanese brother who is a university graduate and speaks very good English.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We spoke with him in English and had no problem understanding him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we were in Japan, I sometimes spoke a message in Chinese, and a brother would translate it into English, because we do not have brothers who speak Japanese fluently enough to translate my messages.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The majority of people in Japan with a college education understand English.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The situation is the same in other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>People who have higher education understand English.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not need to use advanced English grammar when we translate our messages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Simple English is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even though the English is simple, it is full of spiritual content.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is similar to using the level of English spoken in elementary school to explain an important scientific principle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The ministry will spread farther if we publish our books in English.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe that this is the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If our literature does not go out and if the saints rarely go out for the propagation, we will be limited in what we can supply to other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, during my trip overseas, I did not have much opportunity to contact people and I was not able to speak many messages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, only a limited number of people, maybe not more than two thousand, were able to attend the meetings that we held in the different places.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the literature goes out, however, it will reach more people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through the written word people will become clear concerning the messages that the Lord is releasing among us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because Brother T. Austin-Sparks often speaks of us in his ministry, many places in America and Europe are aware of us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, they do not know what kind of medicine we have.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are not clear concerning our ministry, because our literature does not reach them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus far only two books are available to believers in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One book The Normal Christian Church Life is composed of messages given by Brother Nee in London twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The other The Normal Christian Life stirred up a strong response when it was released, and it has rendered much help to many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are also a few articles written by a sister in the West and published in Brother Sparks magazine, A Witness and a Testimony .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Last summer, when Brother Sparks held his annual conference, many believers read the articles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One of our brothers who attended the conference said that the articles in the magazine did not adequately represent what was available through our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The believers abroad do not know about the work that we are doing in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They do not know our ministry or our focus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, once our literature goes out, they will be clear concerning our focus, and I am convinced that this is what they need.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Believers in the West do not have the messages that our literature provides.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The books in Christianity do not contain what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, the believers are spiritually impoverished.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Not many good Christian books have been printed in recent years; therefore, in America classical Christian books from the second and third centuries are being reprinted.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is a market for these books in seminaries and Christian libraries, and believers who seek the Lord are collecting these books.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In recent years a large number of out-of-print classics have been reprinted.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Books concerning church history and books written by the church fathers are also being reprinted in large sizes and in sets.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The reprinting of spiritual classics indicates that not many books with content have been printed in recent years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The subject matter of nearly all of the new books is sugarcoated; the books do not have any content.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the condition of Christianity in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Except for the magazine A Witness and a Testimony, put out by Brother Sparks, the publications available to believers do not contain any substance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Most of them contain only promotional material, advertisements, and photographs.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the Lord would have mercy on us and raise up some brothers to translate our literature into English, there will be a good response after our literature is distributed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord did not give us these messages only for us; they are for His entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should enjoy these messages in the Far East, and the churches in the West should also receive the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, the messages that we labor on are the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As soon as there are saints available to do the translation work, we should translate our books into English.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This will be a great benefit to the believers in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The translation work is somewhat easier than the work on the original messages.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The saints who are preparing the messages to be printed in Chinese are laboring to put out the spiritual supply in a solid way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This labor is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For the sake of the Lord s testimony, we must continue in this work.</S>
