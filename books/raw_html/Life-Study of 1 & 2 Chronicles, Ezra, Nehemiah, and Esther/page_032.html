<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST<br />
AND SECOND CHRONICLES</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">A CONCLUDING WORD TO THE SUPPLEMENT<br />
TO THE HISTORY OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 4:12; 5:12-14</h1>
<p>In this message we will give a concluding word to the supplement to the history of the kings of Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. COVERING ONLY THE KINGS<br />
OF THE KINGDOM OF JUDAH</h2>
<p>The supplement in 1 and 2 Chronicles to the history of the kings covers only the kings of the kingdom of Judah and not one king of the kingdom of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. REMAINING ON THE GROUND<br />
OF THE UNITY OF GOD&rsquo;S CHOSEN PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Unlike the kings of Israel, the kings of Judah remained on the ground of the unity of God&rsquo;s chosen people (Jerusalem) and kept the oneness according to the fundamental teaching of Moses.</p>
<p>Both the people of Judah and the people of Israel were the people of God. However, the people of Israel forsook God and made themselves the same as the people of mankind. As the elect of God Israel should have been sanctified, separated, unto the holy God. But the people of Israel, especially the kings, forsook God, turned to the idols, and set up centers of worship other than Jerusalem. That offended God to the uttermost. Israel was like a wife who forsakes her husband for another man. God, the Husband of His people, would never tolerate such a thing.</p>
<p>The kings of Judah remained on the ground chosen by God and stayed with God. In this matter God was happy with them. Although the condition of the kings of Judah was not pleasing to God, He was pleased with their standing on the proper ground and with their keeping of the fundamental faith according to God&rsquo;s word released to them through Moses. Because of their standing, God still had a people on earth who stood with Him and who at least tried to keep His word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THEIR CONDITION NOT MATCHING THEIR STANDING</h2>
<p>The condition of the kings of Judah did not match their standing on the unique ground and their fundamental belief. Most of these kings were wrong in their intention, purpose, desire, and preference.</p>
<p>To some extent this may also be the situation in some places in the recovery today. Certain ones take the proper ground and keep the fundamental faith, yet they live in the flesh, in the self, and in the natural man. They may be selfish and pursue their own interest, seeking glory and exaltation. Even worse, they may have ambition, something that is hateful and abominable in the sight of God. The root of every rebellion that took place among us in the past seventy-two years has been this ugly and evil matter of ambition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. MOST OF THEM FORSAKING GOD AS THE FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATERS AND FOLLOWING THE IDOLS</h2>
<p>Most of the kings of Judah, like the kings of the kingdom of Israel, forsook God as the fountain of living waters and followed the idols to hew out for themselves broken cisterns which hold no water (Jer. 2:13). In principle, certain local churches have fallen somewhat into this kind of situation, forsaking the fountain of the living waters and following something else.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. NONE OF THEM SEEMING<br />
TO HAVE A HEART THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY PURE<br />
IN SEEKING THE KINGDOM OF GOD</h2>
<p>It seemed that none of the kings of Judah had a heart that was absolutely pure in seeking the kingdom of God, not their monarchy, and in establishing and living for the kingdom of God on the earth and not laboring and struggling for a monarchy for themselves and for their descendants. This is a picture of the situation in some so-called local churches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. BREAKING THE LAW OF GOD</h2>
<p>The kings of Judah broke the law of God, which was given to them through Moses to govern them and keep them in the enjoyment of the God-promised good land. God not only gave His elect people the good land and transferred them out of Egypt and into this land; God also gave them the law to govern them and keep them in the enjoyment of the good land. However, the kings of Judah broke the law of God.</p>
