   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many of the saints are willing to serve the Lord full time but are not so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes the more we pray, the more confused we become.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Should you serve full time, or should you first go abroad to study, or should you serve full time after you graduate?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no need to pray concerning these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need only to take Christ as our person and love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not have to consider our future; we should simply take Christ as our person and let Him live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we continue with our education, we should let the Lord lead us to study while we testify for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not care for old Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Neither do we care for serving full time or not serving full time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Forget about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all need to take Christ as our person and let Him live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we will live to Him even in our studying.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will live to Him in whatever we do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul is a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before he served full time, he was a tentmaker Acts 18:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later, when it was needed, he made tents, and when it was not needed, he did not make tents.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are here to preach the gospel until people are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not worry about whether we serve full time or go abroad to study.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not focus on these things; instead, we should simply take Christ as our person and begin preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He will lead us concerning our future.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I guarantee you that you will not need to worry about your livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I cannot say that the Lord Jesus will take care of your meals, but He will bear you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the Lord of heaven and earth; hence, no one who lives for Him will die of starvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should learn to experience the Lord Jesus as our person in big things and small things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In matters related to our livelihood we should learn to experience Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In daily matters such as sleeping and eating, we must experience Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not worry about our livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I had a very good job before I served full time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My salary was more than a hundred silver yuan a month.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That was considered a very good salary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the Lord led me to leave my job.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I left my job, I had nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time the practice in China was for extended family to live together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, all the money in our family was controlled by my mother.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My mother-in-law, who was a Christian, was concerned about our financial situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She did not agree for me to leave my job.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She said to me, You have a good job.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You can work during the day and lead the meeting in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the Lord s Day you do not have to work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why do you want to quit your job?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What are you going to eat and drink?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In spite of her advice, I listened to the Lord and dropped my job.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>More than forty years have passed, and the Lord Jesus has never allowed my family to starve.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, do not make plans for your future.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Your future is in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Your future is the Lord s future, and His future is bright.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Going abroad to study is not the way, nor is serving full time the way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to take the Lord Jesus as our person and live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should practice living together with the Lord, living the church life, putting on the new man, and preaching the gospel to our classmates and colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are about two to three thousand young saints in the churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must receive the burden to take Christ as our person in a genuine way and practice what we have fellowshipped in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I believe that by the summer of next year, we will gain at least ten thousand young students all over Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This should be easy to do.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must not miss this opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The best time to serve the Lord is today, not in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A co-worker told me that there are saints who want to serve the Lord full time in the future instead of now.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not say that you will serve the Lord in the future; rather, say that you will serve the Lord today and that you will serve in coordination with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who work in schools should serve with the students.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should all work with the students.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After speaking this burden to the saints in Taipei, I will go down to Taichung and speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After Taichung I will speak to the saints in Tainan, and after Tainan I will speak the same thing in Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I will speak to the young people in every locality until they are willing to serve in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I was a student.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I know that the best place to do anything is in the schools and that we will be successful if we labor in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We all need to go to the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It does not matter whether or not we are trained; the Lord will bear the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our need is to cooperate with Him.</S>
