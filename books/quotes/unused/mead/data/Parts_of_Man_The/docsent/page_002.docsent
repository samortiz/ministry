   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE PARTS OF MAN AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THEIR PURPOSES THE THREE PARTS OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A very important verse in the New Testament is 1 Thessalonians 5:23, "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man is of three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is easy to confuse the spirit with the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some people have thought that the spirit and the soul are synonymous terms.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Spirit of God states clearly in His Word that the spirit and the soul are two different entities and that there are three parts to our human being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These are joined by two conjunctions: "spirit and soul and body."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is also this way in the Greek text.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The grammatical construction clearly shows that the spirit differs from the soul just as the soul differs from the body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The soul is not the body; neither is the spirit the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are three distinct parts of one human being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The order used by the Holy Spirit in this verse is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first part mentioned is the spirit, then the soul, then the body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Outwardly we have a body, and inwardly we have the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Between these two, as a medium, is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From the inside to the outside are the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the outside to the inside are the body, the soul, and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Another verse which shows these three parts of our being and the distinction between them is Hebrews 4:12, "For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The soul and spirit are not one entity, since this verse indicates that they can be divided asunder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The soul is the soul and the spirit is the spirit, and these two can be separated just as the marrow can be separated from the joints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The marrow is within the joints; yet the marrow is not the joints, neither are the joints the marrow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They pertain to the physical body and are mentioned with the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So in this verse we have again these three parts the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Luke 1:46-47, we can also see the difference between the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mary said, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Firstly her "spirit hath rejoiced in God," then her "soul doth magnify the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are two things done by her two different organs her spirit and her soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Philippians 1:27 further reveals to us that the spirit and the soul are not one entity, but two.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It says that in striving for the gospel we must "stand fast in one spirit, with one soul" ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is possible for us to be "in one spirit" not the Holy Spirit, but our human spirit , but not "with one soul."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are two different matters related to our two different parts the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So, according to the Scripture man is a tripartite being, composed mainly of the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is very basic for our partaking of the Triune God.</S>
