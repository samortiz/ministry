   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we go on to see the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reality of the Body of Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Nee made a statement, saying that "the Holy Spirit is the reality of resurrection; without the Holy Spirit, there is no resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is not only the life but also the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, most of us can understand that the Spirit is life, but we cannot comprehend that the Spirit is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus said that He is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is this resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This resurrection is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The work of the Triune God in us is to produce the Body of Christ, the reality of which is the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This Spirit as the consummated Triune God, the resurrection, works in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we have the pneumatic Christ, the consummated Triune God, the resurrection, we are practically the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without this, neither the local church nor the elders and the deacons are the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The local church and the elders and deacons are used by the Lord to lead the children of God who are still living in the flesh, the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are still in the flesh, and in the flesh we need to live and we need a place to live in. Furthermore, whenever we come together we should not act improperly; rather, we should behave in an orderly manner.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we need the elders and the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But these are not the diamond itself; they are merely the wrapping for the diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, the diamond needs a box to hold it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, in the local churches all the elders and deacons and all the practices are just the outward wrapping and the box; they cannot be brought to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not need to argue about things such as the autonomy of the local church and the local boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although the local churches are independent of each other in business affairs, they all are one in the matter of the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the treasure?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today how can we produce this treasure?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is by Christ having accomplished everything and ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today, in His ascension, as the Minister in heaven He is working into us, bit by bit, everything that He has accomplished, from His incarnation to His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today we do not need to continue to preach the old teachings as the outward wrappings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not need to argue about the superficial things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As long as the treasure is here, it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you package the treasure, whether you package it this way or that way is not worth arguing about.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether you package it this way or that way, it is still the same gem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether you put two layers or three layers of wrapping around it, it is the same gem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even if you do not put any wrapping around it, it is still the same gem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as this gem is here, it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as we can experience Christ, it is all right; there is nothing to argue about.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether immersion, sprinkling, hot water, cold water, sea water, or fresh water, nothing matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we need to have a thorough seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All that is worthwhile is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should allow the Spirit to come into us and let the cross of Christ be practically put into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is what is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Where are we today?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we are not throwing away all the outward things; we still keep the outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we keep the outward things not according to what we like.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We keep them according to the examples shown in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The example given in the Bible for baptism is by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So, we baptize people into water.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not necessarily baptize people in a baptistery.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We just put people into water; even in a bathtub is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not be legal.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The outward things are not worth our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to pay attention to the treasure within.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we see the treasure within, we will not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As long as we are divided, we no longer see the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, the reality of the Body of Christ is the consummated Triune God within us, who is the pneumatic Christ, the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May the Lord have mercy on us to turn us from the outward things to the reality.</S>
