   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. A DAY OF MEMORIAL IN THE MONTH OF ABIB</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN WHICH NO LEAVENED BREAD WAS TO BE EATEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we would be sanctified to God by taking Christ as our substitute, we need to experience the month of Abib 13:4 , a period of time that signifies our whole Christian life, a time during which we enjoy new life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have pointed out that the word Abib means sprouting, budding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, it denotes a new beginning of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to be sanctified to the Lord for His satisfaction, we need such a new beginning of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to be a green ear of wheat sprouting with new life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this new beginning of life there must be no leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have pointed out that in the Bible leaven signifies sinfulness or corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to deal with all sin that is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must not tolerate any sin after it has been exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To eat unleavened bread in this way is to have a true memorial to the Lord, a genuine remembrance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who are sanctified by having Christ as their substitute and who have a new beginning of life without sin will have a daily living that is worthy of being a memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have a proper experience of God s salvation, we shall have a marvelous spiritual history.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After our Passover, we shall be sanctified to the Lord by taking Christ as our substitute to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we shall have a new beginning of life, and all exposed sin will be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a living will be a memorial, a remembrance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every day we live this kind of life will be a day of memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our Christian life every day should be such a memorial day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Any day that is not a memorial is a day of defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am concerned that many Christians will have very little to remember when they are in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if we live with Christ as our substitute, have a new beginning of life, and deal with all exposed sin, we shall have a great deal to remember in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every day we live in this way is a day worth remembering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is possible for every day of our Christian life to be a memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>May the Lord save us from having to repent over wasted days, days in which there is no new beginning of life and no thorough dealing with leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After we have been saved through Christ as our Passover lamb, we need to take Him as our substitute for the beginning of a new, sinless life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we shall have many days of memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE BONES OF JOSEPH BROUGHT OUT OF</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>EGYPT WITH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Exodus 13:19 indicates that Joseph s bones were brought out of Egypt with the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It may seem strange that these bones are mentioned in the same chapter that speaks of the month of Abib.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Apparently, there is no relationship between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Green ears of wheat, signified by Abib, are full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But dead bones have no life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should remember, however, that in the Bible bone signifies an unbreakable life, a life in resurrection John 19:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the bones in 13:19 have something to do with resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hebrews 11:22 says, By faith Joseph, when near his end, remembered concerning the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Joseph believed that one day God would visit His people and bring them out of the land of Egypt into the land He promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence Gen 50:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The bringing of Joseph s bones out of the land of Egypt into the good land signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The only way dead, dry bones could enter into the land of Canaan was by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the picture, the bones that were taken out of the grave and brought into the good land signify resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1 Corinthians 15:50 Paul says, Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the Bible, flesh and blood denote the natural man Matt 16:17; Gal 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In resurrection, Christ has flesh and bones, but no blood Luke 24:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fact that Joseph s bones were brought into the good land indicates that the saints who have died will enter the kingdom in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The living saints will be raptured and then enter the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who share in the kingdom will no longer be in the natural life signified by flesh and blood, but in the resurrection life signified by Joseph s bones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As God s people today, we need to be in resurrection; we need to be bones that move in resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the eyes of God all the children of Israel had been dead and buried in graves in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That was their situation before the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The land of Egypt was a huge cemetery in which God s people had been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, from God s point of view, His people in Egypt were dry bones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The picture of the dry bones in Ezekiel 37 illustrates the condition of the children of Israel in Egypt: they were dry bones that needed to be resurrected and formed into an army Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>37:1, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The exodus from Egypt, therefore, was actually a resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is seen in particular in the crossing of the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The principle of resurrection applies to the matter of substitution for sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to Galatians 2:20, we have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is no longer we who live, but Christ who lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For Christ to be our substitute for sanctification is to be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Without resurrection, it is impossible for God s people to come out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Both Joseph s bones and the crossing of the Red Sea point to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In our natural life we cannot make an exodus from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To make such an exodus, we must be a resurrected people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although we are dry bones, we are bones that move.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Like the bones in Ezekiel 37, we shall be made alive and become an army.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Just as the children of Israel were dry bones in Ezekiel 37, so at the time of Moses they were also dry bones.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, they were resurrected to become the army of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This should also be our experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The reason Joseph s bones are mentioned in 13:19 is to show us that the exodus is accomplished only in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are sanctified to the Lord and made acceptable and satisfying to Him in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only in resurrection can we have a new beginning of a sinless life and thus have a day of remembrance.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every aspect of the exodus from Egypt is related to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>According to our experience we can testify that without resurrection life there can be no exodus from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The exodus is accomplished only in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many sermons are given exhorting Christians not to love the world and to make their exodus from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Such sermons are filled with empty words.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>No one can leave the world unless he is enlivened by resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we would come out of Egypt, we must be dry bones that have been buried in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But although we have been buried, we have been chosen by God and we shall come forth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We may be dead bones, but these bones signify a life that is unbreakable and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only when this life comes forth in resurrection are we able to have an exodus from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, we come out of Egypt, not by our own energy or by our natural life, but by the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Although Joseph had been chosen by God, he was buried in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, in resurrection his bones were moved out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The principle is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Although we have been chosen by God, we have been buried in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But in resurrection the dead bones can move out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is life out of death!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Hallelujah for the resurrection life that brings us out of the world!</S>
