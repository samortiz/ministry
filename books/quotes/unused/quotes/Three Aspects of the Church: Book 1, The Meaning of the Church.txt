The first aspect is the meaning of the church; the second, thecourse of the church; and the third, the organization of the church
Even when we sing praise and worship God we should not have the feeling that this is a meeting rather we should realize that this is a class
Some saints repeatedly entreated us for permission to come; as a result, there is now a large number of brothers and sisters participating
In the training the trainees need to listen in class, take notes, do their homework, take the tests, and practice
In regard to the second requirement, we expect the trainees to take notes of at least seven hundred to one thousand words per class
We are fellowshipping regarding all these matters because we desire that everyone would understand the real situation
The testing will be carried out in the following manner: Today's classes will be tested tomorrow; every class will be tested once
If a trainee has something important to do and cannot make the class, he must ask for a formal leave of absence
For the rest of the time, because they are serving in different places, they may freely serve, but they cannot do other things
Some of them are serving in the Taiwan Gospel Book Room, and some are local working saints who need to go to work after the training classes
In addition, the brothers and sisters from out of town are not permitted to leave freely during the eight weeks of this training
We are sympathetic toward this kind of situation and have decided to allow these brothers and sisters to go back
In addition, we may also have classes on Friday during the final week; thus, we may have as many as seventy-five sessions
The content of the life-study training in the evening will cover the five books in the Old Testament that we did not finish last year
These five books were written in Hebrew in a poetic style; thus, the Bible expositors call them the books of poetry
Ephesians 3:9-11 speaks first of the economy, then of the mystery, and then of the purpose, the plan, that God made
For something to be uncreated means that it is without beginning or end, self-existing, ever-existing, and unchanging
The church is eternal both in terms of time and nature; it is not something accidental, temporal, or coincidental
Neither did the church come into being simply because a group of sinners were saved by God and gathered together
Those who know the Bible know that God created the universe to gain the church; the church is the center of all things
Most English versions translate this word as 'administration,' but some translate it as 'economy,' and others as 'dispensation'
The best translation is economy meaning that God manages something for a particular purpose of administration management and arrangement
In other words, God carries out His economy with Himself as the resource, His power as the energy, and His wisdom as the means
In eternity when God planned the church, He intended to carry out His plan Himself, that is, to use Himself as the resource
In addition, Colossians 2:9-10 says, 'In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you have been made full in Him'
These verses show that God uses Himself as the resource to produce the church, that is, to make the church full
God uses all His fullness as the resource to carry out His plan for the church, that is, as the material to build up the church
Ephesians 3:20 says, 'To Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us'
To call the things not being as being involves His creation, and to give life to the dead involves His resurrection
The church was in God's plan in eternity, before the creation of the world and all things, before the beginning of time
In other words, in eternity past God drew a blueprint of the church just as if He were drawing the blueprint of a house
In God's building there are two procedures: the first is the preparation of the material; the second is the actual building work
God's creation, in which He called the things not being as being, is related to the preparation of the materials
The God in whom Abraham believed is the One who called the things not being as being and who gives life to the dead
A person who is a descendant of Adam, who has not believed in the Lord, has been created by God but is absolutely not part of the church
In eternity past God planned the blueprint for the church, and in eternity future God will gain the church as a spiritual house
The old heavens and old earth are the universe in the old creation; the new heavens and new earth are the universe in the new creation
The New Jerusalem is the eternal building that God in His eternal plan desires to build, and it is the ultimate manifestation of the church
Ephesians 1:9 shows that the church was purposed in God in eternity according to the good pleasure of His will
In Luke 2:11, when the angel announced the good news, he said, 'Today a Savior has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord'
The priests, kings, and prophets in the Old Testament were anointed by God before they were used to accomplish His purpose
As God the Son of God existed in eternity and is without beginning or end but Christ came into being after God made His plan for the church
David was the only one who possessed all three statuses at the same time; nevertheless, they were not very apparent in him
In contrast, it is apparent that the Lord possesses all three statuses at the same time for the purpose of fulfilling God's plan
In mans eyes God anointed the Lord Jesus after His baptism but Hebrews 12 tells us that God appointed His Son to be the Heir of all things
We must wait for the day when God has worked Christ into all things and when all things are Christ; only then will all things be in harmony
When we live in Christ and when we give Christ the way and the ground in us through the cross, the result is oneness among us
Some may ask, 'Since God Himself is the resource, His power is the energy, and His wisdom is the means, in God's economy where is God'?
In the phrase unto sonship we tend to focus on the ship however in Greek the emphasis is first on being sons and then on the suffix ship
On the one hand, God wants His life to enter into us, and on the other hand, He wants us to enter into all that He is
When a person inherits everything from his father, it means that he enters into everything that his father has outwardly
Whatever circumstances the father has are the circumstances into which the inheritor enters; where the father is, the inheritor will be also
When the Bible speaks of sons, it has two meanings: one is related to life, and the other is related to inheritance
On the one hand, Adam is already dead, but on the other hand, Adam is not dead, because he has given his life to us
God in His eternal plan predestinated us unto sonship, which means that He has determined to give Himself to us in His life
Today people in the world see us as 'the scum of all things' , but in that day we will enter into glory with Christ
When the son came home in Luke 15, the father first went out to meet his son, and then all that the father had became the son's
Just as the nature of a wooden table is wood and the nature of an iron rod is iron, so also God's nature is holiness
In God's plan He wants the church to be holy, meaning that He wants to separate the church from all the created things unto Himself
Ephesians 2 and 3 show that there is a deeper significance to being made holy, that is, God desires to be mingled with man
The New Jerusalem is a city made entirely of pure gold, while its wall is of precious stones, and its gates are pearls
The 'treasure in earthen vessels' in 2 Corinthians 4:7 refers to the process that is carried out between Genesis and Revelation
We, the created earthen vessels, are gradually being transformed in nature, and eventually, we will fully become the treasure, the gold
In terms of separation, we are all sanctified, but in terms of a change in our nature, our 'flavor of clay' is still strong
His humility, meekness, considerateness towards others, and blamelessness are earthly, human, and full of the flavor of commonness
Secular people may praise this kind of person but those who have a spiritual nose can smell that he is altogether of clay not proper or holy
One day the church will be extraordinary and distinct from all other things in the entire universe; the church will be pure gold
For this reason, all our conduct, work, administration, and leading in the church must not be carried out with worldly methods
The preposition to in the original Greek may also be rendered into, as in Romans 6:3, 'baptized into His death'
The church becomes the sons of God by receiving God's life, obtaining God's sonship, becoming God's heirs, and inheriting God's possessions
At the end of Revelation, when the holy city New Jerusalem appears, God will be in the church and the church will be in God
Although we have not yet fully inherited God's possession, we do have a deep sense in our spirit that we are heirs of God
Many times we have a deep feeling that we are in God, yet at other times it seems that we have come out of God
Since God desires that the church have the sonship, be holy, and be to Him, He chose and predestinated the church
From Gods perspective the children of Israel as a whole kept the Feast of the Passover crossed the Red Sea and were saved at the same time
If we read these two books, we will be clear that choosing is not an individual matter but a corporate matter related to the church
Before the creation of the universe, in eternity, God chose the church according to His predestination and foreknowledge
We should not think that we were aimlessly wandering around, not knowing what was going on, and then we simply believed in Jesus
We often think that God's grace came to us because we suffered many blows and hardships and were thus open to receive Jesus as our Savior
Satan thinks that he is clever, but his best schemes only provide God with the best opportunities to manifest His wisdom
God manifests His wisdom in this great universe not only through Satan but even through small men, such as Job
They also ask, 'Since God loves the world, why does He allow all the natural disasters and man-made calamities to occur?
The story of the universe can be compared to a drama, which has a very touching, rich, and complicated storyline
In the arrangement of the parts of our face, we have eyebrows above our eyes so that the rain and sweat cannot flow into our eyes
Sin entered into man, causing him to be guilty of sin before God and also to have the element of death within him
When the Lord Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Satan tried his best to kill Him; in the end he crucified the Lord Jesus
Man's record of sin, the authority of sin, and the death that was brought in by sin were all dealt with by the Lord's death on the cross
It pleases God to make known His multifarious wisdom through the church to Satan and his angels the multifarious wisdom of God is the church
When the church lives before God, it manifests many wonderful stories to man; these stories are the wisdom of God
Verse 10 says, 'To head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him'
In order for us to obtain the sonship, He first causes us to receive His life, and then He works Himself into us
To be holy is to be first separated and sanctified unto Him and then changed in nature inwardly to become the same as God
When man has Christ as the treasure in him, even though outwardly he is a vessel of clay, inwardly he possesses a 'golden' life
After we were saved, we were different from our colleagues, classmates, and neighbors; however, this was only the beginning
Our colleagues go to the movies, and we come to the meetings, but is our going to the meetings sanctification?
We should ask, 'Is my preaching only from myself, or is it from the Spirit of God through His transforming work in me'?
If we are reading only with our mind, our reading is merely an outward sanctification without an inward change in nature
After we are saved we should not be a single person but a dual person that is we must be ones who live by two naturesdivinity and humanity
When we speak, it should not be us alone who are speaking but the Lord who is speaking in us through His mingling with us
When we read the Bible, we should not be reading it by ourselves but by the Lord who is reading in us through His mingling with us
In the same way, as far as the church is concerned, her problem will not be solved if she is not joined to God
On that day God will be satisfied, and man will be satisfied; God's problem will be solved, and man's problem will be solved
God must shame Satan through the church so that Satan's mouth will be shut and so that he will see the multifarious wisdom of God
Without the church, God's problem, man's problem, Satan's problem, and the problem of the universe will not be solved
The system of the universe is one, the source of the universe is one, and the center of the universe is also one
Now in the restoration of oneness, that is, in redemption, there is not only the power of God but also the nature of God
Satan brought the oneness of God's creation into death, but through redemption God brought this oneness into resurrection
On the one hand, God restored this oneness, and on the other hand, He added an additional component into this oneness-the life of God
Satan's rebellion ruined this oneness and brought this oneness into death so that the entire universe was brought into confusion
John 10:29-30 says, 'My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand
We are one not merely because God holds us and places us together but because His life is within us, making us one
John 1:3 says, 'That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us'
The oneness in redemption, in addition to the element of the oneness in creation, has the element of the life of God
Because Satan injected the element of death into man, man has been damaged, has become impure, and is in total disorder
Everything related to the oneness of the New Jerusalem speaks of the golden nature of God and the flowing of God's life
The more this life functions to change the nature in the church, the more the oneness of the church is manifested
The church is transformed little by little, and the more the church is transformed, the more the situation of oneness is manifested
People in Christianity like to speak of unity, but the unity of which they speak is not the genuine oneness, the oneness of the church
He is recovering our function toward God, and He is recovering God's life, which is indestructible, incorruptible, and unchangeable
When Satan introduced death into the universe, the universe was separated from God, and the one accord and the oneness were lost
Wars being fought among the nations and people killing one another demonstrate the lack of harmony and oneness among men
The disharmony in the universe will continue until the restoration of all things, that is, until the coming of the millennial kingdom
The nursing child will play by the cobra's hole, / And upon the viper's den / The weaned child will stretch his hand'
At that time the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun And the light of the sun will be sevenfold like the light of seven days
Isaiah presents a thorough description of the harmonious situation that will occur upon the restoration of all things in the future
If there is a condition of confusion among the brothers and sisters, we know that they are in darkness and lack life
In the restoration of all things, everything will be in the light, and all things will be in harmony with one another
Today, however, in the universe there is no harmony, because all things have been separated from their Creator and have fallen into death
Because of their relationship and function toward God under the power of His creation, all things were in harmony and the universe was one
Once rebellion and death entered all things, the oneness was lost, and all things entered into a state of discord
Today people disobey God, and those who are in lower positions disobey and even oppose those who are above them
Formerly, we were dead in offenses and sins, alienated from the life of God, and were enemies of God, but God's mercy reached us
Through the redemption of the cross and through our believing, God forgave us of our sins and imparted His life into us
In our experience whether or not we arrive at the oneness that God desires depends upon our arriving at the full knowledge of the Son of God
For us to arrive at the oneness is for us to arrive at the full-grown Christ and to allow the fullness of Christ to be manifested among us
Whenever we are short of Christ, we are short of the oneness, and whenever we lack the element of Christ, we are in disharmony
Today is not the time for God to deal with all things; rather, now is the time for God to deal with the church
In order to carry out His complete work of restoration, He must first carry out His work of recovering the oneness of the church
The condition of oneness expressed through the church, depends upon the degree to which the church possesses God's life in Christ
Our fellowship is not based on having the same mind or sharing the same view; rather, it is altogether based on life
If we do not have much experience of being in life, we will not have much experience of being under the authority of the Head
God must first work in the church until the church is full of life inwardly and is entirely subject to the Head
At that time, the church will be completely in oneness without any discord, fully in glory, and entirely God's new creation
The creation is anxiously watching and eagerly awaiting the coming of the day of the manifestation of the sons of God
The church is the firstfruits because God's life reaches and works in the believers in order that they may be the first to mature
In the church service, at times different opinions may arise, all may insist on their own view, and some may be subjective
Not only are the serving ones brought into harmony, but under this shining all the brothers and sisters will arrive at the oneness
As a result, the brothers and sisters will speak different things, and the church will be in chaos, having neither the Head nor the oneness
In chapter 21 we see that God placed the city in the center of the new universe so that the nations might walk by its light
If the brothers and sisters are not in one accord, not in oneness, and not headed up in the workers' homes, death will be there
He will be as the New Jerusalem which is of pure gold without any mixture he will be absolutely one with God and he will be full of Christ
The light of life from within him will dispel the darkness in the workers' home, and the power of life within him will swallow up any death
Today this life is flowing in the church, bringing God's authority, that is, the throne of God, into the church
The city diffuses the light, shining upon the nations, and the glory of the nations is brought back to the city
For the past one hundred years, many people have said repeatedly that the Lord is coming and that we will be raptured
We do believe in the Lord's coming and in the rapture, but the crucial point is that the church is not yet mature
If the church does not mature for another thousand years, the fullness of the times will take another thousand years to be fulfilled
Every one of us in the church are responsible for allowing the Lord to work and shine in us and to be diffused through us
If those who serve together in the church cannot be headed up, we should not expect the entire universe to be headed up
In that day the nations and all things will walk by our light and be brought under the authority of God through our shining
For a person to move about on the earth the way or road he takes is important and even the order of a city is reflected mainly in its roads
If there is no light in a city at night, people will not be able to see the roads clearly, and cars might hit electric poles and pedestrians
If the saints are not in oneness when they gather together, it indicates that there is no light among them and that they are in darkness
If one of these sisters would obey the sense of life and consecrate herself to the Lord, His life would shine out from within her
The picture in Revelation 22 clearly reveals that there is a throne out from which proceeds a river of water of life in the New Jerusalem
According to the Gospel of John, the entrance of God's life into us and its operation in us, brings in the light of life
In the city the river of water of life is continually flowing as a spiral; this is a portrait of the operation of Christ's life in us
The outward expression of the city is the shining of light, and the inner content of the city is the flow of life
At that time the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah , and all things will be headed up in Christ
God is the source of life; therefore, He recovers the oneness of the universe by entering into man to be man's life
Each has his own explanation, and as a result the situation on earth is truly confusing, causing people to be perplexed
We do not agree with what other people think is right, and other people do not approve of what we consider to be good
The thing that makes us one is not doctrine, religion, or the teachings of the Bible; rather, it is the life of God that has entered into us
The degree to which we experience His operating determines the degree of the shining and the oneness we possess
If we are enlightened with the full knowledge of the Son of God , we can be brought into oneness under the shining of this light
Death has damaged the oneness of all things, causing all things to be separated from the Head, the Creator, who is the center
The way of God's salvation is for Him, the center, the Head, and the source to enter into created man to be man's life
Even though God's life is in us, if the light of life cannot be diffused out from us, we can never arrive at the oneness
If the light were restored, however, everyone would immediately be quiet, and the situation would become orderly again
When the life of the Head passes through the church, His Body, and reaches all things, all things become headed up in Christ
The heading up in Ephesians 1:10 refers to all things, and arriving at the oneness in 4:13 refers to the church
Romans 8 shows that the church has not yet arrived at the oneness, because the sons of God have not yet entered into glory
When the New Jerusalem is expressed, the life within her will shine forth, and the nations will walk by her light
Verse 22 says that God subjected all things under Christ's feet and gave Christ 'to be Head over all things to the church'
It is through the church by means of the church, and because of the church that Christ can be Head over all things
God's life operates in the church and shines forth from the church to be light to the nations; this is how He heads up all things
If the church was merely the means for God to head up all things, the church would simply be a vessel used by God
The church would be just like a bottle in the kitchen; when we use the bottle, we do not need to take care of its feeling
Christ subjected all things under the feet of the church so that the church might rule over the universe with Christ
Psalm 45:13 says, 'The king's daughter is all glorious within the royal abode; her garment is a woven work inwrought with gold'
Being the king's daughter implies that she belongs to the king and that she is of the royal family, having a royal status
The sons of God have not yet entered into the freedom of glory; thus, the light of God still is unable to shine forth to all things
All things are still groaning and travailing in pain, are not in harmony, and are not subjected to the authority of the Head
Although we are sons of the Lord of hosts and are of a royal family, our daily living, walk, and behavior do not match the glory of God
Brother Lawrence is an example of a person who was weighty and noble when people contacted him, despite the fact that he was a cook
Later when the king of Babylon stood before Daniel, he felt inferior to Daniel, because Daniel possessed something that he did not have
When the children of Israel returned from captivity, God's authority prospered among His desolated people through Nehemiah and to Nehemiah
At that time Jacob caused all things to be subject to the authority of the Head, and he enjoyed the glory with the Head
In principle, this is our condition today; we can cause all things to be subject to Him and can enjoy with Him the heading up of all things
Presently we are not able see all things subject to Him, because the sons of God have not yet entered into glory
The types of the church as revealed in the Old Testament make it easier for us to know the various aspects of the church
The many types in the Old Testament depict various aspects of the church that are not explicitly spoken of in the New Testament
When we read passages related to the types, we must not be too fast, because a single line in the picture may convey much meaning
In the entire Bible God likens Himself to a man, and He likens the totality of His created and redeemed people to a woman as His counterpart
The purpose of God's work throughout the ages, whether in creation or redemption, is to produce a corporate woman
When the Lord Jesus was working for God on the earth, John the Baptist introduced Him with two titles: the Lamb of God and the bridegroom
The Lord Jesus came to the earth not only to take away the sin of the world but also to gain a group of people to be His counterpart
The phrase marriage of the Lamb connects both titles that John the Baptist used for the Lord Jesus revealing that the Lamb is the Bridegroom
Before God created Eve for Adam, He said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone' , meaning that it was not good for Adam to be alone
When Christ died on the cross, His side was opened, and water flowed out; that is, the Spirit of life flowed out from Him
The water that flowed out from Christ's side and the rib that was taken from Adam's side both refer to the same matter
When Christ died on the cross, not only water flowed out from His side, but blood also flowed out from His side
John 12:24 says, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
Everything in the universe, both plants and animals, must pass through death in order to enter into us to be our life
When God took a rib from Adam's side, the rib must have passed through resurrection in order to become a living woman
On the day of the Lord's resurrection, His disciples became His brothers, and all those who believed into Him received His life
In his person, Abraham typifies God the Father, and in reference to doctrine, Abraham typifies justification by faith
In reference to Sarah as a type of grace, Galatians 4:26 says, 'The Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother'
In regard to person, Isaac typifies God the Son , and in regard to doctrine, Isaac typifies the inheritance in Christ
The focus of this type is not on our living or on sins but on our having being under the authority of the demons
Eve as a type of the church reveals how the church was produced, whereas Rebekah typifies how the church was called
God chose the church in eternity before the creation of the world, but God called the church out of the world in time
The place of God the Father's choosing was in the heavens, but the calling of the Holy Spirit was carried out on the earth
In typology, Abraham's sending of his servant to Paddan-aram was God the Father's sending of the Holy Spirit to the earth
The type of Rebekah shows that the church was chosen out of the world, or we may say that the church was called out of the world
One day Abraham said to his servant, 'You shall go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac'
Hebrews 2:14 says, 'Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same'
If we consider the history of our being called, we must bow our heads and confess, saying, 'The circumstances were just right'!
When the servant met Rebekah according to the circumstances arranged by God, she received the sealing of the Holy Spirit in type
Through the arrangement of the environment, the servant met Rebekah and put a mark on Rebekah as a sign of separation
The mark or signature separates the piece of furniture from all the other furniture in the store, indicating that it belongs to us
There may have been many girls who came out to draw water, but the servant chose Rebekah; she alone was called
When the servant sensed that Rebekah was the object of his calling he immediately put a nosering upon her nose and bracelets upon her hands
The breathing of our nose is related to our existence, and the movement of our hands is related to our actions
After the servant put the golden ring upon Rebekah's nose and the golden bracelets upon her hands, she went home
The mark that the Holy Spirit places upon us is not something apart from the Holy Spirit it is the Holy Spirit Himself that is God Himself
It is good to have God's life in us, but at the same time, His life often bothers us in regard to our living and actions
A pledge is similar to something that has been pawned; thus, the thing that is pawned may also be called a pledge
Similarly, the gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing that the old servant gave to Rebekah were samples of the wealth of Isaac's house
The servant took a portion of Isaac's riches and gave it to Rebekah in order to show her the wealth of the one she was to marry
Previously, Abraham had given everything to Isaac; thus, if Rebekah married Isaac, all that he had would become hers
In typology gold signifies the life of God silver signifies the Lords redemption and clothing signifies the righteousnesses of the saints
The salvation that the Lord gives us is pledged by the Holy Spirit who works the Lord's redemption on the cross into us
It is in the Holy Spirit that God accepts and justifies us, and it is also because of the Holy Spirit that our behavior is changed
All that we receive in the Holy Spirit works out the completion of God's salvation in us, causing us to be fully saved
After the servant finished the sealing, testifying, and pledging, Rebekah should have immediately followed him
Her mother and brother, however, were reluctant to let her go and requested that she stay for at least ten days
Some parents hinder their children some children hinder their parents some wives hinder their husbands and some husbands hinder their wives
On the one hand, there is the willingness of the church, but on the other hand, there is the willingness of the individual saints
When the Holy Spirit works in us, no matter how difficult the future may seem, we called ones spontaneously say, 'I will go'
From the experience of our salvation, we can testify that when we said, 'I will go,' our inner being was strong and buoyant
Although we thought of the difficulty of our future, there was a power within us, strengthening and supporting us to say, 'I will go'
Rebekah as a type of the church speaks of the church being chosen from the world and of the journey of the church
Rather, she traveled a long distance from Paddan-aram, until one day toward evening, Isaac came to welcome her
Some people spend all of their time speaking of how the church will be raptured and of the timing of the reaping of the harvest
We should not consider the matter of rapture merely in terms of a prophecy; rather, we must consider it in terms of a journey
In regard to direction, Rebekah traveled upward over a long distance, and Isaac came downward for only a short way
At the end of this age, Christ will come back to the earth to meet the counterpart whom He has called throughout the ages-the church
There are oxen and lambs in God's tabernacle but never camels; however, on the path through the wilderness there are camels
The path taken by the church on the earth throughout the past two thousand years has been long, hard, and rugged
The reason the churches in China are in their present condition is due to the persecution of Christians in the Boxer Rebellion
The 'all things' spoken of in Romans 8:28 and 32 are the means that God uses to take His church onward in her journey on the earth
Rebekah's head covering indicates not only that she came under an authority but also that she hid and covered herself and ceased to exist
In the type of Eve, there is a union and two becoming one flesh, but we do not see the result of two becoming one flesh
The issue of the union of Christ and the church is that the church is with Christ, enjoys Christ's love, and Christ is satisfied
Adam and Eve in Genesis are the first couple in which the husband typifies Christ and the wife typifies the church
Joseph was conspired against by his brothers , just as our Lord Jesus was killed by the Jews, His brothers in the flesh
According to the type of Rebekah, Isaac remained in the land of Canaan and did not go down to Paddan-aram to search for Rebekah
Even though Asenath continued to live in Egypt, she no longer belonged to Egypt because of her marriage to Joseph
In the same way, even though the church is in the world, she does not belong to the world because of her union with Christ
He typifies Christ as the Apostle sent by God to save the children of God from their degradation, that is, from Satan's usurpation
Zipporah typifies the aspect of the church in the wilderness, being gained by Christ when He was forsaken and wandering in the wilderness
Rebekah portrays the church as the called one, Zipporah portrays the church in the wilderness, and Ruth portrays the church in redemption
After God called Abraham, He gave Abraham every blessing: heavenly and earthly, material and spiritual, and even God Himself
Abraham received all the blessings that God prepared for man in His eternal plan, the blessings in both His creation and redemption
At the time of Boaz, the inheritance of land was not an important issue, and the priesthood had become desolate
At that time the kingship was the most important of the blessings related to the birthright, and Boaz was the lawful heir of this blessing
Genesis 19:30 through 33 and 36 through 37 show that Moab was born through incest between Lot and his eldest daughter
As a result, after the death of her Chinese husband, she would have the legal right to inherit her husband's possessions
If an Israelite took a wife and died without a son, his brother should take her as his wife and raise up a seed to him
Ruth's background speaks of the corrupted and fallen aspect of our being; God will not save this aspect of our being
The principle of redemption is not to save the sinful aspect of man but to save the aspect of man that was created and later fell into sin
Some believe that the husband spoken of in Romans 7 refers to the law, while others consider him to be the flesh
According to the viewpoint of the entire Scripture, the husband in Romans 7 refers to the created yet fallen old man
Hebrews 2 says that it is not to angels that Christ gives help; instead, He gives help to the seed of Abraham , to men with blood and flesh
In the fall the created aspect of Adam became the fallen aspect of Moab thus there is still a need for Christ to redeem the created aspect
Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same'
Christ does not have any obligation to save the angels, and the angels do not have the right to enjoy Christ's redemption
Just as Rebekah had to be of the same family as Isaac, Ruth had to be of the same family as Boaz in order to be redeemed by him
Once Christ became a man, He had the obligation to redeem man so that man could have the right to receive and enjoy His redemption
Because our husband, as part of the old creation and Adam, has died, Christ can become our Redeemer and our Husband
Ruth and Boaz, inheriting their lawful blessing together, typify Christ and we becoming one to inherit our lawful blessing together
They were delivered from their fallen position and the element of Moab when their old husband, their created part, died
David typifies the warring Christ in the midst of sufferings; thus, his wife Abigail typifies the warring church in the midst of sufferings
Solomon typifies the resurrected and glorified Christ; hence, the Shulammite typifies the church in resurrection and glorification
David typifies the Christ who passed through all kinds of sufferings and Davids wife Abigail typifies the church in the midst of sufferings
The Christ in Song of Songs is the resurrected Christ who passed through death, came out of death, and entered into resurrection
The Christ whom we experience every day is the One who passed through all kinds of sufferings, death, and resurrection
What we believe is not dead and empty doctrine; instead, in our spirit we have touched the Spirit, the Lord who is in resurrection and glory
When we testify for the Lord and work for the Lord in our outward living we can be likened to Abigail wandering with David in the wilderness
On the one hand, we are within the veil as the Shulammite, living in the Holy of Holies and enjoying the resurrected and glorified Christ
Inwardly we have the enjoyment of the Shulammite in the secret place, and outwardly we have the public living of Abigail
Philippians 3:10 says, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
No one can take the way of the cross by himself; neither can he follow the footsteps of Jesus the Nazarene by himself
For the church to be in resurrection means that the church is experiencing and enjoying the resurrected Christ
The Body of Christ is not natural or of the old creation; rather, the Body of Christ is in resurrection and of the new creation
In John 7:38 the Lord said, 'He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water'
After Rebekah was married to Isaac, little is recorded about her, and what is recorded does not typify the church
Whereas the focus in the other Gospels is on His humanity, the focus in the Gospel of John is on His being God
In Luke the Lord Jesus is portrayed as a man, in Mark He is portrayed as a slave, and in Matthew He is portrayed as a King
Jesus replied Your brother will rise again to which Martha responded I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day
Possessing life is not the same as possessing resurrection; resurrection is life plus something that cannot be detained or restricted
The meaning of resurrection is that life breaks through all bondage, oppression, and imprisonment and is not held by them
Resurrection did not come into being three days after the Lord's crucifixion; rather, it existed before the creation of the universe
Resurrection did not come into being when, after having experienced birth, human living, and death, He was raised from the dead
For thirty-three and a half years Satan, who has the might of death, tried his best to hold down resurrection by binding and limiting God
During the Lord's human living, Satan heaped every negative matter and thing upon Him, but He came out of them
The Shulammite typifies the glorified church in the future, and she also typifies the church in resurrection today
The type of the Shulammite is not merely objective in the future; she is subjective and for our experience today
During the Boxer Rebellion a brother was saved because he saw and was touched by the manifestation of resurrection
At the peak of the Boxers's rioting, when they were brutally killing the Christians, many stores in the city closed
He received the Lord because of what he saw, and later he gave up everything, saying, 'I also want to go out to preach the Lord Jesus'
The Shulammite's living with Solomon in the palaces of ivory typifies the church fellowshipping with Christ in the Holy of Holies
God never intended for us to take the way of the cross by our own strong perseverance and reliance on ourselves
Outwardly speaking, the way of the cross is harsh, but those who take this way realize that there is a power within them
These are not two separate experiences; rather, the two exist simultaneously, one being inward and the other being outward
Inwardly, Christ, as typified by Solomon, enables us to take the way of Jesus the Nazarene, as typified by David
There is a complete union and full satisfaction between the Shulammite and Solomon, and in this satisfaction there is rest
As seen in the type of Eve, the church comes out of Christ and is born of Christ, having Christ's nature and being one with Christ
When Christ was forsaken by men, He became the Savior of men; when He was in the world ministering life, He obtained a wife, the church
As seen in the type of Abigail, the church is composed of a group of people who by nature were those who forsook and opposed Christ
If we put these seven aspects together, we can see a complete picture of the church and have a thorough understanding of the church
The children of Israel connect two categories because God considers the children of Israel as a corporate woman as well as His habitation
The children of Israel also typify God's habitation because they were corporately God's dwelling place on earth
Ephesians clearly says that the church is Christ's counterpart and that the church is also God's dwelling place
In Old Testament typology, the children of Israel connect the two types concerning the church by being both a woman and a dwelling place
Verse 7 says Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump even as you are unleavened for our Passover Christ also has been sacrificed
Their exodus from Egypt and their journey in the wilderness typify the church coming out of the world and journeying in the wilderness
The church not only fell into the world and was under the authority of Satan, but she also fell into sin and was under God's condemnation
The crossing of the Red Sea typifies the baptism of the church, signifying that the church died with Christ and has been buried with Him
According to the sequence of the fall, man fell first under the authority of Satan and then under God's condemnation
According to the sequence of God's salvation, we are first redeemed from condemnation and then saved from bondage
During this period of immaturity and wandering, the church has yet to attain to God's purpose or come up to God's standard
There is a twofold significance in the type of the children of Israel crossing the Red Sea and journeying through the wilderness
Egypt is the place where God's chosen people were usurped, and the wilderness is the place where God's elect journeyed
Before our salvation, we were under the usurpation of the world; after our salvation, we are sojourning in the world
It took them a total of thirty-eight years to travel from their crossing of the Red Sea to their crossing of the Jordan River
The failure of the older Israelites indicates that only when the nature of the old creation dies can the church achieve God's purpose
The new generation of the children of Israel did not enter Canaan until the old generation, which had come out of Egypt, died
In order to cross over the Jordan and enter into the land of Canaan, the nature of their old creation needed to be terminated
In the same way, although the world was buried through baptism, our baptism was only the beginning of our following God
We still need to journey through the wilderness and cross over the Jordan, burying our old man, to enter into Canaan
The Egyptian army was buried in the Red Sea, but the Israelites themselves were buried in the waters of the Jordan River
The children of Israel left twelve stones in the Jordan River, signifying that their old man was buried in the water
They took twelve stones from the river and brought them to the other side of the river into the land of Canaan
When the church truly crosses the Jordan, the old creation will pass away, and everything will be of the new creation
Once the children of Israel crossed through the Jordan, their life of wandering in the wilderness came to an end
Whereas the water of the Red Sea buried the Egyptian army, the water of the Jordan River buried the children of Israel
When we were baptized, although we died with the Lord and were buried with Him, according to our experience the world was buried
The crossing of the Jordan signifies that the life of wandering has ended and that our self has been terminated in Christ's death
The failures of the children of Israel in the wilderness were not related to Egypt but were the result of the flesh and the self
Once the flesh self and old creation were dead and buried in the Jordan River the new man rose up and entered into Canaan as the destination
In regard to Canaan, there is the matter of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ and the matter of spiritual warfare
When the church fulfills God's purpose, it immediately enjoys the riches of Christ and engages in spiritual warfare
In the Old Testament three items are often mentioned to describe the riches of the land of Canaan: milk, honey, and grapes
It was not until the children of Israel entered Canaan, a place flowing with milk and honey, that they enjoyed the riches of Christ
All the riches of the land of Canaan are related to life and the riches of life, typifying the riches in Christ
The entrance of God's people into the land of Canaan signifies their entrance into the unsearchable riches of Christ
On one hand, the church enjoys all the riches of Canaan, but on the other hand, she engages in warfare to deal with God's enemy
Both Joshua in the Old Testament and Ephesians in the New Testament speak of the enjoyment of the riches and spiritual warfare
Revelation 12 shows that the overcomers will war with Satan, the result of which will be the coming of the kingdom of God
In the Old Testament, after the kingdom of Israel was established, Solomon, the king of peace, sat upon the throne
Not long after that the children of Israel were defeated in warfare, became desolate, and were finally carried away in captivity to Babylon
On the day of Pentecost the apostle Peter said, 'The God of our fathers has raised Jesus, whom you slew by hanging Him on a tree
The main reason that the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon was due to the sins of Jezebel and Ahab
The case of Jezebel depicts the desolation of the children of Israel and typifies the desolation of the church
Jezebel's causing the children of Israel to be carried away to Babylon parallels the church's being taken captive to Rome
We should never think that the books of 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles are only speaking of the history of the Israelites
We will also see that the church is desolate just as the children of Israel became desolate shortly after building the temple
We will see that the church has been taken into captivity just as the children of Israel were carried away to Babylon
If we take the history in the Old Testament as a picture of the church, we will see a detailed type of the church
Later the kingdom of Israel became desolate, the temple and the city were lost, and the books of law were taken away
According to the history of the church, the church also became desolate, losing the presence, authority, and revelation of God
When the church degraded into Roman Catholicism, God's presence and authority were lost, and all that remained was human rule
The revelation of God was also lost, and the church became filled with the teachings of the deep things of Satan and human opinions
When God began His work of recovery, He carried it out according to three lines: the temple of God, the city of God, and the word of God
People such as Ezra, Zerubbabel, and Nehemiah came out of Babylon and returned to the original ground to rebuild the temple and the city
His expounding of the law in the Scriptures was even more enlightening than the Scriptural exposition at the time of Moses
Ezra, as a scribe, recovered the priesthood, and Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, as heads of the province, represented the kingship
Since Martin Luther, there have been some Zerubbabels, Ezras, and Nehemiahs in the process of the recovery of the church
When we read the books that these ones have written, we sense that a certain one was an Ezra and that another was a Zerubbabel or a Nehemiah
The recovery of the children of Israel in the Old Testament is a precise type of the recovery of the church in the New Testament
Ezra brought in the recovery of Gods word Zerubbabel brought in the recovery of the temple and Nehemiah brought in the recovery of the city
The history of the recovery of the church is the history of the recovery of the word of God, the temple, and the city
After the children of Israel were recovered even though they still had weaknesses and failures they had a glorious hope the coming of Christ
In the church the matters of the word of God, the temple, and the city have been recovered to a certain degree
In the same way, in the church today the Bible is much more transparent to us than it was fifteen hundred years ago
The tabernacle was the center of children of Israel, and the twelve tribes of Israel encamped around the tabernacle
When the people of Israel gathered together they met at the entrance of the tabernacle hence the tabernacle was called the Tent of Meeting
Just as the tabernacle was God's dwelling place for man to enter and meet God, so Christ is the dwelling place of God for man to contact God
In other words, the incarnation of the Lord Jesus provided God with a tabernacle, a place for Him to dwell on earth
The Lord's coming to the earth in the flesh was His becoming a tabernacle, in which God could dwell on the earth among men
The tabernacle as God's dwelling place on earth is an exact portrait of the church as God's dwelling place on earth
Revelation 21:3 clearly says that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God with men; God will tabernacle with men there
In terms of the members of the church, every believer is a tabernacle of God, a temple of God, a habitation of God
In the future the totality of all God's redeemed throughout the ages will be a great tabernacle, the New Jerusalem
The base of the tabernacle was composed of sockets made of the expiation silver spoken of in Exodus 301116 thus silver denotes redemption
The tabernacle was a portable structure that could be taken apart, freely moved, and then assembled together again
His thoughts were clear, his judgment was accurate, his will was strong, and his emotions were rich and proper
When God created man, He used the dust of the ground, but when He remakes us, He uses the divine nature, typified by gold
In our daily life we are neither accurate in our speech nor precise in our timing; moreover, we are neither genuine nor strict
Even though we are saved, we do not realize that the purpose of God's salvation is to remake us and to change our character
We have urged the saints to train their character, but few brothers and sisters have experienced much of a change in their character
In this way, his character will be changed from decayed wood to acacia wood, and the church will be strengthened
Throughout the past two thousand years of church history, the church has been able to stand because of her strong human element
Consequently, God gave Muller a particular commission for the age in which he lived because he was solid, exact, and strict
It is true that the boards of the tabernacle were overlaid with gold, but the firmness of boards was due to the firmness of the acacia wood
The reason that many local churches are weak is that the brothers and sisters are weak in their humanity; that is, they lack the acacia wood
God is seeking spiritual men in whom there is no lack in their human element and in whom their humanity matches divinity
They were acacia wood, strong and firm, and thus were able to stand and bear a glorious testimony for the Lord
The tabernacle was able to stand because of the stable base of the silver sockets, but it still needed the firm acacia wood as support
The boards of the tabernacle show that the divinity, gold, was on the outside, and that humanity, acacia wood, was on the inside
No action in the church should be individualistic but should require two sockets; it should be testified to by another person
The brothers and sisters start out as individuals, but by the Holy Spirit operating as the bars within them, they become one
The ability of the boards to stand depended upon the acacia wood, whereas their being connected together depended upon the golden rings
In the tabernacle the golden rings, not the wood of the boards, were used to join the boards together to form a wall
If we live only in our humanity, we will be separated and scattered, but if we live in the divine life, we will be one
At that time the Spirit of God existed, but 'the Spirit' was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified in His resurrection
The title the Holy Spirit was not used before the incarnation, because divinity had not yet been brought into humanity
Similarly, the title the Spirit was not used before the glorification of Jesus, because humanity had not yet been brought into divinity
Exodus 26:1-14 describes the four layers of the covering of the tabernacle, beginning from the inner to the outer layer
Our two hands each have five fingers, and all five fingers are needed in order to work and bear responsibility
The ten curtains divided into two groups of five curtains indicate that man bears responsibility before God on the ground of testimony
Cherubim were embroidered upon the curtains, and in the curtains of fine twined linen there were blue and purple and scarlet strands
Fine flour signifies the fineness of the Lord Jesus' humanity , and fine linen denotes the purity of the Lord's humanity
The seraphim in Isaiah 6 plus the cherubim in Ezekiel 10 compose the four living creatures in Revelation 4:6-8
One aspect of the significance of the cherubim is related to God's glory, and the other is related to the four living creatures
The cherubim embroidered on the curtains signify that the glory of God was manifested in the created humanity of the Lord
Fine linen mainly denotes the fineness and beauty of humanity, whereas acacia wood mainly denotes the solidness and strength of humanity
The covering of the tabernacle was for the expression of glory, and as such, it needed to be fine and beautiful
The strength and beauty of humanity are typified by the fine linen, and the glory of divinity is typified by the cherubim
The cherubim, representing God's glory, were upheld by the fine linen, because the cherubim were embroidered upon it
When a priest entered into the tabernacle, he saw acacia wood overlaid with gold and fine linen embroidered with cherubim
When people come to the church, they should see divinity upheld by humanity, that is, gold and cherubim upheld by acacia wood and fine linen
The second layer of the covering was composed of five curtains plus six curtains , signifying the excessive condition of man before God
Whether a person looks from the inside or from the outside, he will not be able to see the church's curtains of goats' hair
The outward appearance of the church should not have anything that attracts people; rather, the beauty of the church is God within
Even though the church does not outwardly have any attractive appearance she is strong and able to withstand any attack storm and difficulty
In the tabernacle, everything elevated is detailed and intricate, but everything positioned close to the earth is simple and plain
Similarly, the covering of the tabernacle was splendid, being made of fine linen and embroidered with cherubim
The beauty of the church is seen only by looking upward; when looking downward, all that is seen is a desert land
The floor of the tabernacle indicates that the church is journeying on the earth as a sojourner, a pilgrim, walking through the wilderness
If a person looked up in the tabernacle, he would see blue, purple, scarlet, and white as well as embroidered cherubim
The outermost part of a person is the body, the inner part is the soul, and the innermost part is the human spirit
Finally, the condition of those who have made further spiritual progress can be associated with the Holy of Holies
Under the grace of the new testament, our Lord is the High Priest in the heavens, and we are priests serving God
Although the position and status of all the believers are equal before God, our inward spiritual condition may differ and vary greatly
The various kinds of people who served God in the tabernacle typify the spiritual condition of the individual believers in the church
On the other hand, we do acknowledge that there are indeed different levels in the spiritual growth of the saints
According to position, there is no rank among the saints; there is no first class, second class, or third class
As far as spiritual experience is concerned some are living in the outer court some are in the Holy Place and some are in the Holy of Holies
The altar was where offerings were offered to make expiation for the offerer , and the laver was for washing the hands and feet
Before a person is saved, in type he is outside the curtains of fine linen and has nothing to do with the tabernacle
In the Holy Place there are three main items: the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar
In studying the type of the tabernacle, it is difficult to determine whether the outer court or the Holy Place signifies the outer man
From one perspective, the Holy Place is located inside the outer court, but from another perspective, the Holy Place is outside the veil
The book of Hebrews does not exhort us to enter the Holy Place but to enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, within the veil
The Holy of Holies is the place where God dwelt, because only the Ark in the Holy of Holies typifies Christ Himself
Christ is able to have an effect on our soul, causing us to be filled and joyful, and enabling us to sense God's acceptance
Another saint may testify that he was the topmost sinner but that the Lord Jesus died for him and released him from the burden of his sins
Now that Christ has delivered and released him from bondage, he feels that he must abandon all sinful matters and serve the Lord
From his testimony we know that he is in the outer court at the altar and the laver offering oxen and lambs and washing his hands and feet
If he is faithful to the Lord, the Holy Spirit will show him that he is still in the process and has not yet reached the destination
A person who lives in the Holy Place prays much, and the sound of his prayer is like the fragrance of the incense altar in the Holy Place
At that time, many brothers and sisters seemed to touch the presence of Christ and Christ as life, and as a result, they were excited
In the Lord's Day meeting we often see people coming with lambs and oxen, hustling and bustling to offer sacrifices
Even though the number of people is smaller, the prayer meeting is deeper than the Lord's Day morning message meeting
At the time of prayer, sometimes we are even able to touch Christ directly, touching something deeper in certain saints
The real value of the tabernacle altogether depended upon its content, just as the nobility of a house depends upon those who live in it
According to our human perspective, the three sections begin from the outer court and proceed to the Holy of Holies
From the human perspective, the altar was the place for expiation, yet from God's perspective, expiation is not the only emphasis
According to Leviticus 1, the burnt offering was the first offering among five kinds of offerings and denotes man offering himself to God
We may consider only that God desires to be our food and satisfaction, but the Bible also tells us that man is God's food and satisfaction
In the burnt offering, man as a creature puts himself into the hands of the Creator to become the Creator's food and satisfaction
The altar, as a type of the cross, is related both to the sin offering for redemption and the burnt offering for consecration
Experientially, a person's self cannot be dealt with unless he willingly offers himself to God to be put to death
Religion teaches that people give themselves to God in order to accomplish a great enterprise, a great work, for God
The burnt offering means that man gives himself to God to be terminated by God for God's enjoyment and satisfaction
In regard to the blood the cross is for redemption from sins however in regard to death the cross is for the burnt offering for consecration
When a person becomes ashes before God, he becomes a fragrance to God, something for God to eat, enjoy, and possess
In the Old Testament, when David sought to build a temple for God, God sent Nathan to David to tell David not to build it
Some people have once said that all the furniture and utensils in the tabernacle, according to their sizes, could fit in the altar
In other words, the capacity of the altar was sufficient to contain all the furniture and utensils in the tabernacle
When a priest entered the tabernacle and handled the furniture or utensils, he had to first pass through the altar
No one could handle the furniture and utensils or enter the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies without passing through the altar
On one hand the cross is for redemption and consecration, on the other hand, it is the basis for all spiritual experience
Those who served in the tabernacle were required to wash their hands and feet in the laver in order to be cleansed
The blood cleanses us from condemnation, and the water cleanses us from contamination, from uncleanness, in our being
If the child then goes out to play and is careless, his clothes will become dirty, and he will be condemned by his mother
If he confesses to his mother and asks for forgiveness the problem of his offense can be solved however there still is dirt on his clothes
Even though there is no barrier of offense between the mother and the child, his clothes still need to be washed
Before a certain brother was saved, he worked for the government and embezzled public funds to buy a bed, a desk, and a chair
After he entered within the boundary of righteousness and purity, he immediately sensed that his stealing was a sin
Although the blood cleanses us from the record of sin before God, it cannot wash away the defilement related to these sins
Defilement is only washed away through the laver, that is, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit
When the brother knelt down to pray, the Holy Spirit bothered him and spoke to him with power, saying, 'Go and return these things
We still have filthy thoughts and improper concepts in our mind, and our actions are contaminated by earthly defilements
The cleansing of the precious blood cleanses us of our sin before God; the washing of the Holy Spirit rids us of our inward filthiness
In other words, the problem of sin is dealt with at the altar, and the problem of filthiness is dealt with at the laver
In Matthew 5:24 the Lord says, 'Leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother'
The bronze used for the laver came from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting
At the altar, judgment cleanses men from condemnation, and at the laver, shining rids men of their uncleanness
At most, they are able to testify that they liked playing mah-jongg and going to movies, but now they sense that these things offend God
He will even be able to testify that Christ is in him as the power of life, enabling him not to be defiled by earthly things
The power of life within him is displayed especially when he gives a testimony that is full of the power of life
The display of the bread of the Presence signifies the power of life, and the shining forth of the lampstand signifies the light of life
The bread signifies that Christ's life satisfies and strengthens us, and the light shows that Christ's life shines on us as our light
The fragrance of the incense ascended upward, the bread of the Presence was displayed, and the light shone forth
Through Christ we have the power to live the Christian life, the light to proceed on our way, and the means of being accepted before God
Although the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar were found in the Holy Place, they still were manifest
All the offerings offered on the altar, as well as the bronze laver, were located in the outer court and were altogether visible
The three items in the Holy Placethe displayed bread the shining light and the ascending incensespeak of outward aspects of inward matters
The Bible and our experience indicate that even though man's soul is something inward, it belongs to the outer man
A person who has not been saved for a long period of time has normally experienced Christ as life, light, and acceptance
It can be said that the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar refer to aspects of Christ
The three items that are displayed openly in the Holy Place are related to items hidden within the Ark in the Holy of Holies
Both the incense altar and the budding rod are items in resurrection, and both are related to acceptance and recognition
If we live in ourselves, we will be as those of the company of Korah and will provoke God's hatred and rejection
The three items in the Holy Place have been encapsulated within the Ark, that is, within Christ, in the Holy of Holies
Some experience Christ's life as the bread of the Presence, whereas others experience Christ's life as the hidden manna
Some are led by Christ through enjoying the shining of the lampstand, whereas others are led by Christ through experiencing the hidden law
These experiences indicate that the cross, the washing of the Holy Spirit, the manifest Christ, and the hidden Christ are all in the church
There is also a small number of saints who are deeper in their experience, knowledge, and gaining of Christ than those in the Holy Place
They have a deeper knowledge of God, and they have the authority, the resurrection life, and God's acceptance in them
The types related to the furniture in the tabernacle show that there are saints in the church who have these different experiences
Everything that enables us to live before God, walk before God, and reign for God is hidden in Christ as the center
The function of the fellowship in our spirit depends upon the supply of life and is thus related to the will in our soul
The budding rod is related to the conscience in our spirit, because the conscience enables us to obtain peace before God
From our perspective, our experience begins at the altar, but as far as God is concerned, it begins from the Ark
Regardless of the starting point, the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle forms the shape of the cross
The experience of the cross is not for the sake of experiencing the cross; rather, the cross enables man to experience Christ
Beneath the tabernacle, silver sockets supported the standing boards, which were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold
The outer court of the tabernacle was framed with hangings of fine linen supported by bronze sockets, bronze pillars, and silver rods
When the Lord appeared to John in Revelation 1:15, it says, 'His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace'
Fine white linen denotes the righteous acts of man before God, the righteousness that enables man to be acceptable to God
In Luke 15 the first thing that the father did for the prodigal son when he returned home was to change his robe
When we received the Lord Jesus, God gave the Lord Jesus to us as our righteousness, and thus we were justified by God in the Lord
When we are in the Lord, He becomes our garment, the best robe, which enables us to meet God's requirement and glory
Everything outside the hangings was unrelated to the tabernacle; however, everything inside the hangings was related to the tabernacle
If we read about the types in the Old Testament carefully, we will see that the tabernacle contained fine white linen within and without
Among our colleagues, family, friends, and relatives, there should be an expression in us that we are justified by God
The hangings, the white linen, signify the justification that we express, which is the separating boundary between the church and the world
White linen was hung on the silver rods, and the silver rods were on the pillars standing in the bronze sockets
Anything that is within this boundary is fine, clean, white, and beautiful, without any filthiness or coarseness
We must realize that justification is not merely a doctrine, that is, something objective; it is also something very subjective to us
Anyone who has received the Lord's work of the cross and is truly justified by God must display the condition of the fine white linen
If a person truly has received the justification in Romans and Galatians, he will have the works of justification in James
After meeting the Lord, he not only dealt with his unrighteous possessions but also tried his best to give away everything that he owned
Those who are within the boundary of the church should be like fine white linen, expressing a significant change in their living
He must be dealt with in another place and wait until his leprosy is cleansed before coming back within the boundary
The separating line between us and them is not a Christian symbol that we wear, but the fine white linen within us
While others are able to eat, drink, and talk casually, we cannot, because there is a distinction between us and them
We are a group of people who have received the Lord's work of the cross, the Lord's redemption, and God's justification
The boundary was not related to the bronze sockets and the silver rods but only to the clean, fine, and white linen hangings
These linen hangings were hung on silver rods, and the silver rods were on pillars that had their base in the bronze sockets
The church is a realm that is only for those who have been regenerated and have experienced changes in their life and behavior
Sadly, after some people change their garments in baptism,they do not have much of a change in their life and living
One who is baptized into the church and is received by the church must change his garment, that is, his living
Even though the tabernacle was divided into three sections, there was only one separating line within the tabernacle
If a person in the church wants to progress from being an outward Christian to being an inward Christian, he must pass through the veil
He has passed the separating boundary between the world and the church, but he has not passed through the separating line of the veil
He has entered into the outer court and even into the Holy Place, but he has not entered into the Holy of Holies
The serpent that was lifted up on the pole was exactly the same in appearance as the serpents that bit the people
The main emphasis in regard to the veil is whether it has been rent and whether the man of the flesh has been cleft
We may have been saved and bear an expression that is clean and fine; nevertheless, the veil of our flesh may still be whole and not rent
The veil is not a matter of being good or evil or of being sinful and worldly; rather, it is something that must be rent
The cross has already abolished the base of the law which is the flesh therefore the wall which is the law has spontaneously been eliminated
The separating line between the church and the worldly people indicates that the latter is filthy, but the church is clean and white
The linen hangings are a matter of being righteous or unrighteous; the veil is a matter of being holy or unholy
We may not watch movies, go dancing, or enjoy leisure like worldly people, and we may not have worldly hobbies, much less blatant sins
We cannot deny that this is the result of the work of the Spirit of God within us; nevertheless, we remain whole
The creature that needs to be broken is not the sinful creature who loses his temper but rather the creature who expresses God
Romans 1 can be compared to a person clothed in a garment that was taken from a garbage dump, a person covered with filthiness
If we look at the ratio of the size of the sections in the tabernacle, we will realize that the outer court was quite large
The Old Testament shows that all the actions in the Holy Place and all the activities in the outer court were governed by the Holy of Holies
When the condition of the Holy of Holies was proper, the actions in the Holy Place and the activities in the outer court were also proper
Whenever the condition of the Holy of Holies was even slightly off, the condition of the Holy Place and the outer court were also affected
If there is hardly anyone in the church living in the Holy of Holies, the outward activities of the church will have problems
If there are some in this condition, the outward activities will be proper; otherwise, the outward activities will be improper
If no one lives within the Holy of Holies in the church, the life of the church and the outward activities of the church will have problems
It is only when we enter into the Holy of Holies that all the items become hidden and invisible; this is something deep and inward
Those who enter through the fine white linen hangings are in the tabernacle and have been separated from those outside of the tabernacle
Everyone in the church should bear an expression of fine white linen and be inside the white hangings made of fine twined linen
The veil was made of fine white linen with a heavenly color and the condition of being redeemed, royal, and noble
After God accomplished this, Job was able to say, 'I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You'
We must see that the number of people among us who enter the Holy of Holies is the number of those who have been rent
The temple and the tabernacle reveal two aspects of the church, each appearing in two different periods of Israel's history
During the time of Israels sojourning in the wilderness there was the tabernacle after Israel settled down in Canaan there was the temple
These items require the supplement of the temple; likewise, some items of the church require the supplement of the tabernacle
When the aspects of the tabernacle and the temple are considered together, the church can be completely and clearly explained
At that time the Jews did not understand what this word meant, but later the disciples understood that the Lord was referring to His body
The Jews used the hands of the Gentiles to destroy the body of the Lord Jesus, but after three days He was raised from the dead
In a strict sense, Solomon built the temple, but David cannot be excluded because he had much to do with its building
In principle, this shows that Christ in His suffering prepared all that was needed for the building of the church
David typifies Christ in His death; thus, everything prepared by David typifies what Christ obtained in His death
Solomon typifies Christ in His resurrection; everything Solomon prepared typifies what Christ obtained in His resurrection
In ancient China, people planted cypress trees at gravesites because an evergreen cypress symbolizes everlasting life
The principle of the mingling of God and man is also seen in the building of the temple, where the aspect of wood is quite important
In this regard, we do not need to speak doctrinally; instead, we must know this matter according to experience
If a brother cleans the windows in the meeting hall nicely and thinks that he has done the best job, he has a problem
Everything that passes through death and resurrection is able to endure and withstand opposition, criticism, and setbacks
Some brothers and sisters require people's gratitude, exaltation, and appreciation for their service in the church; this is to seek a reward
In response, the sheep asked, 'Lord, when have we seen You hungry and have fed You, or thirsty and have given You a drink?
If a brother is full of feeling when he offers material things for the Lord's work, his offering certainly contains a natural element
Whatever passes through death and resurrection comes out of life, and what comes out of life is spontaneous, without any special feeling
If we inwardly have a sense of accomplishment after doing a certain thing or fulfilling a task, we are still in our natural man
When Peter was preaching concerning the Lord in Acts 2:24, he said that it was not possible for Him to be held by death
Whatever issues from resurrection does not need a reward, and what comes out of life is not affected by criticism
Such a person never thinks of other people's assessment of him and does not expect any appreciation or reward from man
A person who has passed through death and resurrection cannot be touched by people's appreciation or indifference
The type of the building of the temple shows that there should be only cypress and cedar in the church, not any other kind of wood
Formerly Peter's name was Simon, but after the Lord revealed that He would build His church, He changed Simon's name to Peter
In the church some brothers and sisters can be compared to 'wild' stones, freshly cut from the quarry and full of sharp edges
Wood denotes death and resurrection, and stones denote man's need to be regenerated inwardly and dealt with outwardly
People in the church must not only pass through death and resurrection but must also have God's life and be dealt with by Him
When we consider the condition of some brothers and sisters, we cannot deny that they are stones; however, they are freshly cut stones
They have been regenerated, and they love the Lord, but they are not willing to be dealt with; consequently, they are full of sharp edges
They may be capable and quick-witted, but they cannot bear the testimony because they have never been dealt with
When this kind of person comes into the church to coordinate and serve, their round shape needs to be made square
Only those who have passed through death and resurrection and who have been dealt with can be materials for the building up of the church
The materials are men who have passed through death and resurrection, who have been dealt with, and who also contain divinity
In the outer court of the temple there was a molten sea with twelve oxen upholding the sea, all of which were made of bronze
The materials for the building of the templebronze silver gold timber and stonetypify the materials used for the building of the church
When Moses built the tabernacle, he built it according to the pattern that was shown to him in the mountain by God
Chronicles 28:11-19 indicates that the Spirit of God inspired David with the design for the construction of the temple
God revealed to Moses the blueprint for building the tabernacle, and He revealed to David the blueprint for building the temple
Even though Solomon was the one who built the temple, he did not receive revelation directly from God; rather, he received it indirectly
Throughout two thousand years of church history the Roman Catholic Church has been involved in great controversies with regard to Matthew 16
Even before the papacy was introduced into Catholicism, there were sharp contentions concerning the design of the church
Having received mercy from God, we need to realize that the building of the church is not merely a matter of doctrine but also of life
If men had been willing to judge their flesh and themselves, the pope and archbishops would not have come into being
On the evening of the day of Christ's resurrection, His Spirit entered into them, enabling them to pray in one accord for ten days
On the day of Pentecost, God was able to produce the church through them and thus fulfill the word spoken in Matthew 16
According to the light of the truth, they are the authority in the church, and the brothers and sisters should submit to them
Sometimes the brothers and sisters submit themselves to the elders as if they were students submitting to a school principal
In the presence of the older brothers, we should live before God, and when they are absent, we should live before God in the same way
The revelation of the church unveiled in the Scriptures can be carried out only by the resurrected Christ as the Spirit of resurrection
We cannot take a doctrine merely as written instructions, nor can we merely take the basis of the Scripture as a safeguard
From the types revealed in the Bible, we can see that the design revealed to David must be executed by Solomon
We may contend for a correct doctrine, but if our person is wrong, we are still wrong even though our doctrine is correct
We would see that we still speak in ourselves and act in our flesh and that we have not been broken and do not act in our spirit
These words should become a lamp shining within us, causing our outward contentions for doctrine to completely collapse
Gold for the things of gold and the silver for the things of silver and for all the work by the hands of the craftsmen
The deeper meaning of consecration is that in the building of the church there is a need for the consecration of the person
As a result, they discuss the matter and ask a brother to go and serve in the locality in order to meet the need
A group of people first establishes a 'church'; then they go to a seminary to find an outstanding student from among the graduates
The building of the church depends upon consecration and not upon looking for people to attract and add to the church
If our service is the result of human exhortation, human contact, and human relationships, we are finished before the Lord
If our motive in contacting people is to attract and win them, we will offend the Lord and be condemned by Him
Every piece of stone used for the building of the temple was, in principle, already cut and dealt with in the mountains
At the time of the building, there was only the need for the pre-cut and shaped stones to be placed one on top of the other
If everyone remains silent after the contentious brother has spoken, his voice will surely disappear within a short time
If he notices that the other party only seeks to argue, oppose, and criticize, he will swallow his words and remain silent
In any meeting, if a brother stretches out his hand and another brother also stretches out his hand can they clap
In the Lord's table meetings we have sometimes heard people fighting against one another by praying to nullify another one's prayer
In order to build the temple, to build the church, we must live in resurrection, live a consecrated life, and receive God's dealing
We must all constantly live in resurrection, reject all that we are, live a consecrated life, and receive God's dealings
He gave all that he had for the temple and continually submitted himself under God's hand to receive God's dealing
After the time of Babel, the goal of God's work was with the descendants of Abraham; it was no longer with the descendents of Adam
The Old Testament shows that there are two obvious steps through which God gained man: the priesthood and the kingship
They were God's dwelling place among his people in their wandering and in their settling down; one was movable, and the other was set
Gods gaining of a man not only enabled God to have a dwelling place on earth but it allowed Him to establish His throne in the midst of man
Reading from Adam all the way to Abraham, we discover that there were men on earth whom God was able to truly gain
When created man failed to accomplish God's purpose, the chosen and called ones replaced them and filled the lack
The principle of the Nazarite was that a man would cooperate with God and allow God to possess all that he had
On the day that he stood before the Ark, David possessed a threefold status: he represented man, fellowship, and authority
God is able to produce a solid dwelling place among man when there are men on earth fellowshipping with God and allowing God to rule
The church could not exist on the earth if no one was gained by God, fellowshipped with God, and allowed God to rule
In this way, God is able to establish His throne among man and thus establish a dwelling place on earth in which His glory is expressed
We need to ask ourselves: When God touches us, are we willing to submit to Him, allow Him to rule in us, and allow Him to gain us?
The outpouring of the Holy Spirit that occurred at Pentecost does not come through crying, praying, and fasting for several days
The building of the temple depends upon man being gained by God, fellowshipping with God, and being ruled by God
The temple itself, as a symbol, did not have problems; rather, the children of Israel, as the reality of the temple, had problems before God
Initially, God gained them and set them apart from Egypt; nevertheless, they forsook God and returned to their former place of captivity
Since there was no one whom God had gained, who fellowshipped with God, or who was ruled by God, there was no need for the temple to exist
The church is a group of people on the earth whom God gains so that they might fellowship with Him and let Him reign
Since the three factors related to the origin of the temple were absent, there was no need for the temple to exist on the earth
In order to obtain His dwelling, God called the father of the Israelites to come out of Babel, that is, Babylon
The children of Israel were eventually taken captive and returned to the original place from which they had been called
Even before they physically returned to Babylon, their inward condition indicated that they had already returned to Babylon
Babylon represents the world associated with idolatry, and Egypt represents the world associated with earning a livelihood
The Israelites' going down to Egypt and their returning to Babylon typify that God allows the church to return to the world
The recovery of the temple depends upon man being gained by God, fellowshipping with God, and being ruled by God
The principle behind both the destruction of the temple and the recovery of the temple is based upon the origin of the temple
At the time of the Reformation God gained Martin Luther just as He had gained Daniel and his three friends ones who clearly lived before God
At that time, however, although the temple was restored, the city was not yet recovered, because there was not much of God's ruling
The things that they have recovered will not be secured until there are some who see God's authority and let God reign
The church, God's dwelling place, comes into being when man is gained by God, fellowships with God, and allows God to reign
Ephesians 5:31-32 indicates that the church is God's counterpart, and 2:21-22 says that the church is the dwelling place of God
Being a woman is a matter of life and position, and being a house, or a dwelling place, is a matter of function
Both aspects are for the purpose that God would obtain a dwelling place on earth, express Himself and His glory, and exercise His authority
Her life issues from God, and her position is that of being joined to God as one and being part of God under His authority as the Head
The church is joined to God and allows God to dwell within it and be expressed through it so that God's will can be carried out
The children of Israel were a woman on one hand and a city on the other; they were both a counterpart and a dwelling place
The children of Israel as a type connect the two categories of Old Testament types concerning the church: a woman and a dwelling place
The consummation of the church will be the New Jerusalem as a woman to be God's counterpart and as a city to be God's dwelling place
