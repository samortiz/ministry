   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FOUR THE BELIEVERS THEIR STATUS 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover the three remaining aspects of the believers' status after being saved: co-kings of Christ, partakers of the Holy Spirit, and heavenly citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Co-kings of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that the believers are priests of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we need to see that they are also co-kings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those believers who live in the reality of the kingdom in this age will be co-kings with Christ in the millennium. a. In Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is in resurrection that the believers are co-kings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Speaking of the overcoming believers, Revelation 20:4c says, "They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here the word "lived" means that they were resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation 20:6 says, "Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no authority; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first resurrection here is the best resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Greek word translated "first" is the same word rendered "best" in Luke 15:22, where the father commanded that the best robe be put on the returned prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the first resurrection in Revelation 20:6 may actually be translated "the best resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who are co-kings of Christ will enjoy this resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first resurrection is also the out-resurrection, for which Paul sought Phil 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a resurrection that is set apart from the common resurrection; it is a resurrection with honor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the first resurrection is also the resurrection of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 20:6a says, "Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This must be the highest blessing to inherit the kingdom manifested on earth and even to be co-kings of Christ in it. b.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Consummation of Their Maturity in the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Being co-kings of Christ is in the consummation of the believers' maturity in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Until we reach maturity in the divine life we are like young princes, those who are too young to be kings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A king must be a matured person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before a prince can be a king, he needs to grow and mature in the kingly life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then he will be qualified to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, we need to grow in the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, this growth will reach the consummation of maturity in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once we have reached this maturity we shall be qualified to be co-kings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second Timothy 2:12a says, "If we endure, we shall also reign with Him."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This verse implies being a co-king of Christ in the consummation of maturity in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we endure in this age, we shall reign with Christ in the coming age. c.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Reigning Over the Nations and Shepherding Them on Earth</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who are co-kings of Christ will reign over the nations and shepherd them on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 2:26 and 27 say, "He who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations, and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Reigning with Christ over the nations is a prize to the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As they reign over the nations, they will shepherd them, for in the millennial kingdom the ruler is the shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Psalm 2:9 God gave Christ authority to rule over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here in Revelation 2:26 and 27 Christ gives the same authority to the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Two other verses that speak of the believers reigning over the nations on earth are Revelation 12:5 and 5:10.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Revelation 12:5 says that the man-child will "shepherd all the nations with an iron rod."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This man-child signifies the stronger part of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The fact that the man-child will shepherd the nations with an iron rod indicates that the man-child consists of the overcoming believers, as mentioned in Revelation 2:26 and 27.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, Revelation 5:10 says that the believers will reign on the earth.</S>
