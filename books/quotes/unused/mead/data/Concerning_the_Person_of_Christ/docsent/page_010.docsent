   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Following that, He says that He is the First and the Last, the beginning and the end Rev 22:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our Lord is the God who is self-existing and ever-existing, without beginning and without end, yet who is the beginning and the end. May we offer up to Him the worship which He as God is worthy to receive! May we forever praise Him as God, the true God, the perfect and complete God! Amen! Hallelujah!</S>
