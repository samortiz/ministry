   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From then on the creed had been revised and expanded again and again until A.D.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>553, when a creed that was richer and more exhaustive than the previous ones was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This creed was called "The Athanasian Creed," and its contents are as follows: Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But this is the catholic faith: That we worship one God in trinity, and trinity in unity; Neither confounding the persons: nor dividing the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For there is one person of the Father: another of the Son: and another of the Holy Ghost.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Godhead of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is all one: the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father is uncreated: the Son is uncreated: and the Holy Ghost is uncreated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Father is immeasurable: the Son is immeasurable: the Holy Ghost is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Father eternal: the Son eternal: and the Holy Ghost eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And yet there are not three eternals; but one eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As also there are not three uncreated: nor three immeasurable, but one uncreated: and one immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So likewise the Father is almighty: the Son almighty: and the Holy Ghost almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And yet there are not three Almighties: but one Almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So the Father is God: the Son is God: and the Holy Ghost is God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And yet there are not three Gods; but one God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So the Father is Lord: the Son Lord: and the Holy Ghost Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And yet not three Lords; but one Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord: So are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say, there are three Gods, or three Lords.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Father is made of none; neither created; nor begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Son is of the Father alone: not made; nor created; but begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Holy Ghost is of the Father and the Son: neither made; neither created; nor begotten; but proceeding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus there is one Father, not three Fathers: one Son, not three Sons: one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And in this Trinity none is before or after another: none is greater or less than another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the whole three Persons are co-eternal, and co-equal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He therefore that will be saved, must thus think of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation, that we believe also rightly in the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now the right faith is, that we believe and confess, that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds: and Man, of the substance of his mother, born in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perfect God: and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead: inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who although He be God and Man; yet He is not two, but one Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh; but by assumption of the Manhood into God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One altogether, not by confusion of substance; but by unity of person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man; so God and Man is one Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Who suffered for our salvation: descended into hades: rose again the third day from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He ascended into heaven: He sitteth on the right hand of the Father God, the Father almighty: From whence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At whose coming all men must rise again with their bodies; And shall give account for their own works.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; but they that have done evil, into everlasting fire.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the catholic faith; which except a man believe truly and firmly, he cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Glory to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So it was, and is, and ever shall be, without end forever.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Amen.</S>
