<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Not Covering His Transgressions<br>and Hiding His Iniquity<br>because of the Fear of the Great Multitude</H2><P>Job continued by saying that he did not cover his transgressions as Adam did nor hide his iniquity in his bosom because of the fear of the great multitude and because the contempt of the families frightened him (vv. 33-34). He realized that it would have been sinful to cover his transgressions because he was afraid of others. Then he said, "Oh that there were someone to hear me!/Here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me./And let my accuser write up the charge./Surely I would carry it [the scroll containing the charge] on my shoulder;/I would bind it onto me like a crown; /I would declare to Him the number of my steps;/Like a prince I would approach Him!" (vv. 35-37).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Not Securing Land without Money<br>or Causing Its Owners to Lose Their Life</H2><P>Finally, Job boasted that he did not rob others of their real estate. He did not secure land without money or cause its owners to lose their life (vv. 38-40).</P><P>Job's boasting here indicates that he was in the realm of human ethics, not in the realm of the divine economy. Regarding human ethics, Job was quite good; however, regarding the divine economy he missed the mark. In the Lord's recovery today, we need to care for God's New Testament economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. JOB'S THREE FRIENDS CEASING<br>TO ANSWER HIM</H2><P>Job 32:1 says, "Then these three men ceased answering Job, for he was righteous in his own eyes." They could not handle Job, and they did not know what to do with him, so they stopped talking. No one forced them to cease answering Job. Having become tired of talking to Job, they decided to cease speaking to him.</P>
