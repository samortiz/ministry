<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(11)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST<br>AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH,<br>BRINGING IN THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL<br>AND OF ALL THINGS, WHICH CONSUMMATES IN<br>THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 64&#151;66; 61:6</H1><P>In this message we will cover chapters sixty-four through sixty-six. These chapters reveal the second coming of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah, bringing in the restoration of Israel and of all things, which consummates in the new heaven and new earth. The most striking thing in these chapters is the new heaven and new earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST<br>AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH</H2><P>Isaiah 64:1-5a and 66:15-16 reveal the second coming of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah (cf. 31:4-5). Isaiah 64:1 says, "Oh that You would rend the heavens, that You would come down." This refers to the consummation of Christ's coming from heaven to earth, from God to man.</P><P>The Bible shows us that Christ does not intend to remain in the heavens forever. Rather, He intends to come down to earth and remain on earth for eternity. However, before He can do this, He needs to accomplish His work of renewing the earth. He wants to stay not on the old earth but on the new earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE PROPHET'S PRAYER</H2><P>In 64:5b through 12 we have the prophet's prayer. Isaiah knew God's heart and prayed according to it. First, he confessed the sins, failures, iniquities, degradation, and corruption of Israel. Then he asked Jehovah to look at them as His people.</P>
