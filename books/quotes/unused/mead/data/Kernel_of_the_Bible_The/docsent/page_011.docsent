   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOOD FOR THE BUILDING OF GOD S HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the children of Israel were crossing the Red Sea, the armies of Egypt pursued them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the Angel of the Lord miraculously buried the armies of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This refers to our baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After we received Christ as our Redeemer, our life, and our nourishment, we crossed the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that we were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we crossed the Red Sea in baptism, all the worldly forces, the Egyptian armies, were buried in the baptistry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After we were baptized, we found ourselves in the wilderness on the other side of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have been redeemed, we have been delivered, and now we are able to be for God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Egypt, we were not good for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But once we cross the Red Sea, we are good for God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are no longer under God s judgment, in Egyptian bondage, or in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s judgment, the bondage in Egypt, and sin are all over.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are free, purified, and absolutely good for the building of God s house on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>CHRIST BEING SMALL,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>FULL OF LIFE, ETERNAL, AND PURE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the children of Israel had eaten the lamb and the unleavened bread, they still needed to take the heavenly element into them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they were to be God s dwelling place, they had to be heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, in the wilderness Christ came to them as the heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the Angel of the Lord, Christ is great.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But as the manna, Christ is small, like coriander seed, and tiny, like frost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our Christ is both great and small.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In delivering us, He is great, but in nourishing us and making us heavenly, He is small.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hallelujah for the great Christ and for the small Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one is greater than Christ, and nothing is smaller than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is great to deliver us, and He is small to nourish us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we want to eat something large, it must be cut into pieces and made small enough to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Praise the Lord that Christ is as small as a coriander seed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although He is so small, He is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is a small seed, not a small grain of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Exodus 16:14 says that manna is a round thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Roundness in the Bible signifies eternity, that which is without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the Christ we eat is small, He is full of life and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Exodus 16:31 also tells us that the manna was white, which indicates purity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>EATING CHRIST AND EXPRESSING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the children of Israel ate this wonderful manna day by day, they gradually lost the smell of garlic.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, they had the aroma of heavenly honey, for the taste of manna was like wafers made with honey Exo 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many years ago, in Taiwan, our family doctor told me that his daughter s skin had become yellow in color from eating carrots.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She ate so many carrots that she expressed carrots.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Likewise, if you eat a great deal of manna, you will become white, the color of manna, and you will express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My maternal grandparents ate a great deal of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They ate fish two or three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever my mother took me to visit them, I was bothered by the fact that everything in their home smelled of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My mother explained that, because my grandparents always ate fish, they naturally smelled like fish.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise the Lord that we have a heavenly fragrance because we are eating the heavenly food, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is being wrought, constituted, into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the children of Israel were redeemed from God s judgment and delivered from Egyptian bondage, they were transformed by eating the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They were changed from having the odor of garlic to having the fragrance of the heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, with the children of Israel in the wilderness, God eventually gained a dwelling place among His chosen, redeemed, delivered, and transformed people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We also have been freed from God s judgment, from Egyptian bondage, and from the smell of garlic, and now we are good for the building of God s tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All this is a picture of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ is the delivering Angel, the speaking Moses, the redeeming and nourishing Lamb, the sanctifying unleavened bread, and the transforming manna.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Oh, Christ is so much to us!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually, we are redeemed, delivered, enlivened, and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are no longer good for anything of Egypt; we are only good for God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s glory filled the tabernacle in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For God s glory to come down means that God Himself comes down to earth to dwell in His habitation for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church today must be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Out of the enjoyment of Christ, the church comes into being to fulfill God s purpose, that is, to express God and fully satisfy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now we have the tabernacle as God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
