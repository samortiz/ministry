   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-SIX A COMPANION OF GOD 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 32:30 33:23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the record of a very particular matter, a record that reveals that Moses was a companion of God 32:30 33:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE NEED OF A MEDIATOR</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The making of the golden calf was a severe blow to both God and Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before the calf was made, everything was going smoothly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moses was on the mountaintop with the Lord, and the Lord was revealing to him the design of the tabernacle and its furniture and utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No doubt, God and Moses were very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But at the end of the forty days Moses spent on the mountain with God, the children of Israel did evil in making a golden calf and worshipping it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By doing that, they broke the first four of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The worship of the golden calf caused a serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What should God do?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Should He give up the children of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Should He forsake His purpose in bringing them out of Egypt?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Surely God could not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you had brought more than two million people out of Egypt, not according to your mood, but according to your promise, would you have been able to give them up?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God delivered the children of Israel in order to fulfill His promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God brought the people out of Egypt, led them through the wilderness, and brought them to Mount Sinai, where He gave them training.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suddenly, as a great surprise, the children of Israel did evil by worshipping the golden calf What the children of Israel did caused God a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What should He do?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In principle, we may have the assurance that God would not give up His people or abandon His project with them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the contrary, He would still go on with them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But how could He go on with the children of Israel in such a situation?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The problem God faced with His people can be compared to certain problems between husband and wife or between parents and children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although a wife may cause her husband a serious problem, and although the children may cause their parents serious problems, the husband cannot give up the wife, and the parents cannot give up their children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There must be a way for the husband and wife and the parents and children to go on together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, it was necessary for God to find a way to go on with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He needed a way out of the problem that had arisen regarding them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s way out was through Moses as the middleman, the mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to be a middleman, a mediator, between God and the children of Israel, it was necessary for Moses to be intimately involved with both parties.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moses was uniquely qualified to be the mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He had had nothing to do with the worship of the golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He had been kept from that evil thing and was preserved in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, he was the only one among God s people who was clean.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, Moses was very close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we shall see, the way Moses expressed his petition to God indicates that his relationship with God was an intimate one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I believe that, deep in His heart, God expected Moses to come in as the mediator between Him and the people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was God s desire that Moses would give Him a way out of the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without a middleman who could speak to God intimately, God would not have had a solution to His problem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No doubt, God wanted to be appeased.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 32:30 Moses indicated that propitiation was necessary: And it came about on the next day that Moses said to the people, You have sinned a great sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And now I will go up to Jehovah; perhaps I can make propitiation for your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The offense caused by the children of Israel was extremely serious.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What they did was inexcusable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They did not merely do something wrong; they made an idol and worshipped it as if it were God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They used the name of the Lord in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In so doing, they offended God to the uttermost, and it was as if they left no ground for Him to forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It seemed that there was no possibility for God to come in to forgive this offense or to say anything to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Apparently, the only thing He could do was destroy the children of Israel there in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, there was the need of a middleman, a mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How good that Moses was there to be the mediator between God and the children of Israel!</S>
