<p>After we are saved, God draws and constrains us with His love so that we would love Him and willingly consecrate ourselves to Him. When we are constrained by His love, He can work in us as He pleases. We can consecrate ourselves only if we have been drawn and constrained by His love. If we have been drawn and constrained by God&rsquo;s love, our only response will be to love Him and to consecrate ourselves to Him. If we have been drawn and constrained by God&rsquo;s love, we will love God, and if we have been touched and captured by God&rsquo;s love, we will consecrate ourselves to God. Once we consecrate ourselves to God, He has an opportunity to work in us. God reveals His love to us so that we would sense His love and be drawn and constrained by His love.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John shows that the Lord wants us to believe in Him and then love Him. Believing in Him causes us to receive Him as life (3:15, 36; 6:40, 47); loving Him causes us to live out His life through His working in us (14:21, 23; 15:10). If we believe in Him but do not love Him, the life that we have received from Him will not grow in us or work in us so that we would be conformed to His image and express Him. Hence, we must love Him as well as believe in Him. Chapter 21 records the story of the Lord leading Peter to love Him. Although Peter believed in the Lord, he was short in loving the Lord; thus, after the Lord resurrected and ascended, He came back to lead Peter to love Him more so that Peter would allow the Lord&rsquo;s life to work in him according to the Lord&rsquo;s desire (vv. 15-17).</p>
<p>The maiden in Song of Songs represents every believer, and her pursuit illustrates a loving pursuit that gives the Lord an opportunity to do an inward work in her. Her pursuit comes from receiving a revelation of the Lord&rsquo;s love and from being drawn by the Lord&rsquo;s love. The maiden&rsquo;s pursuit of her beloved, who represents the Lord, and her interactions with the beloved are the result of being drawn by his love. Our loving the Lord gives Him an opportunity to work Himself into us until we are full of His stature. If we want the Lord to work in us, we must be like the maiden and receive a revelation of His love and be drawn by His love to pursue Him. No one can pursue the Lord without being drawn by His love. Only those who pursue the Lord in love will give Him an opportunity to work in them so that they may grow in life unto maturity. We must be drawn by the Lord&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us... that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:14-15). This word shows that Paul had been constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love; thus, he could count all things as loss and fully pursue the Lord (Phil. 3:8, 12). The Lord caused Paul not only to have faith but also to love Him (1 Tim. 1:14). Paul&rsquo;s faith toward the Lord enabled him to receive the Lord and the Lord&rsquo;s life; his love toward the Lord enabled him to consecrate himself to the Lord, to let the Lord work in him so that the Lord&rsquo;s life would grow in him unto maturity. Paul was filled with the Lord, and he wanted the Lord to be formed in him so that his living might be Christ (Phil. 1:21). He was full of the Lord&rsquo;s stature because the Lord&rsquo;s love motivated him to love the Lord and to consecrate himself so that the Lord could gain him and work in him as He pleased. His love toward the Lord was the result of being constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love. The Lord constrained Paul with love so that he could be gained by the Lord and let the Lord be worked fully into him.</p>
<p>Receiving by believing enables us to gain the Lord; consecrating because of love enables the Lord to gain us. The Lord must gain us in order to work in us. Only a consecration out of love will enable the Lord to gain us. Hence, the Lord constrains us with His love in order to produce a response in us to love Him, to consecrate ourselves to Him, and to let Him work in us. The Gospels show that the Lord led His disciples to believe in Him before His death and to love Him after His resurrection. The Acts and the Epistles show that the Lord led the disciples to believe and love Him so that He would have an opportunity to work in them and make all that He is available to them as the Spirit. Because the disciples were drawn by the Lord&rsquo;s love, they loved and followed the Lord and let Him work in them as He pleased. The disciples&rsquo; experience applies to all who have followed the Lord throughout the ages. Hence, we must be drawn and touched by the Lord&rsquo;s love in order to willingly consecrate ourselves to Him. We must be touched and constrained by His love to such an extent that we could only consecrate ourselves to Him and never flee from Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Redemption in God's Plan &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
