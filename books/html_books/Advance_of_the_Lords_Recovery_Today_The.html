<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for this moment. Thank You for gathering us all into Your dear name. Lord, we have no trust in ourselves. We trust in You, and we trust in Your cleansing blood. How we thank You for the cleansing blood that cleanses us all the time. Lord, we thank You for Your presence, and we thank You for Your speaking. We thank You for Your heavenly oracle, and we thank You that You can be and would be one with us in the spirit. Lord, display the fact that we are one spirit with You in our speaking. Lord, defeat the enemy. We ask You by touching Your throne of authority to deal with the evil one. We accuse him before You in Your mighty name. Lord, in Your mighty name we even bind the strong man, the evil one. Lord, put him aside. Be with us, glorify Your name, and fill this hall with Your presence. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ADVANCE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY TODAY</h2>
<p>In the past few years, I have spent much time to reconsider the teaching of the Bible. After much reconsideration I have the burden to share with the saints the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been going on progressively throughout the centuries of the history of the church, and it is still going on because it has not reached its peak yet. Throughout the centuries of church history, the recovery has always been advancing and will continue to advance until it will reach its consummation. Even among us in the past sixty years there have been a number of advances. In these years, the Lord has shown us something more in His going on. This is why we have entitled this book <em>The Advance of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery Today</em>. In this book I have the burden to present what the Lord has shown us in the past few years. The four major items that the Lord has shown us are the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament, the organic building up of the Body of Christ, the perfecting of the saints by the gifts, and the prophesying for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ. These four major items are the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today.</p>
<p>These four items are big &ldquo;missings&rdquo; in today&rsquo;s Christianity. They all have been missed. I am burdened to the uttermost with these items. In these days, I am consumed with these four items. I am here on this earth to labor with the Lord and in the Lord so that He can recover the gospelizing by the New Testament priests of the gospel of God, the organic building up of His organic Body, the perfecting of all the common saints by the gifted persons, and all prophesying, speaking Christ into others for the building up of the church. These four items are on my shoulders. I am burdened. The Lord desires to recover these four big, crucial, major things missed among His people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD</h2>
<p>The first item that the Lord desires to recover is the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament. The New Testament reveals that we are priests of the gospel of God. The terms <em>priests</em> and <em>priesthood</em> may be familiar to us, but I do not believe that many of us are familiar with the term <em>a priest of the gospel of God</em>. This term is only mentioned in Romans 15:16. Let us look first at the present translation of this verse in our Recovery Version: &ldquo;That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; We have reconsidered the Greek text of this verse, especially the portion translated &ldquo;ministering as a priest the gospel of God.&rdquo; We feel that a better translation of this phrase is &ldquo;a ministering priest of the gospel of God&rdquo; or &ldquo;a working priest of the gospel of God.&rdquo; Here is a priest who is ministering and working. We may even say that such a priest is &ldquo;an energizing priest of the gospel of God.&rdquo; From our study of the Greek text, we feel that this phrase can be in apposition to the previous phrase, &ldquo;a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations.&rdquo; Thus, a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations is a ministering priest of the gospel of God, a working priest of the gospel of God, an energizing priest of the gospel of God. A minister of Christ Jesus must be a priest of the gospel of God. I have studied and expounded the book of Romans in the past, but I did not see until recently that we are priests of the gospel of God. In the Old Testament, the priests were working and ministering to offer animal sacrifices to God, but Paul as a New Testament priest was busy in the gospel of God.</p>
<p>The truth concerning the priesthood began to be recovered from 1828 when the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in England. They saw the universality of the priesthood. Before that time, Bible teachers thought that the priests were a particular body of special people. This was the reason that the clergy-laity system was built up. The so-called common believers became the laity. According to this concept, someone who is not of the clergy is a layman, and if someone preaches the gospel who is not of the clergy, he is a lay preacher. Thus, two classes of believers came into being, and this brought the Lord&rsquo;s children back to the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, the majority of the children of Israel could be considered as the &ldquo;laity.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s original intention was for the entire nation of Israel to be a &ldquo;kingdom of priests&rdquo; (Exo. 19:6). However, because of their worship of the golden calf (Exo. 32:1-6), most of the Israelites lost the priesthood. Later, only Aaron and his sons were the priests, and the Levites served the priesthood in practical matters (Num. 3:6-10). The British Brethren, however, saw that in the New Testament, according to Revelation 1:5b-6 and 1 Peter 2:5 and 9, every believer is a priest.</p>
<p>The New Testament teaches us clearly that all the believers are priests. We are not individualistic priests, but we are priests in a corporation to become a priesthood. This is the teaching of the New Testament that the Brethren saw. From the very beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us, we also saw this truth concerning the priesthood, but neither we nor the Brethren pointed out that the priesthood in the New Testament is the priesthood of the gospel. Yes, we all are priests, but what kind of priests are we? Today we see that according to Romans 15:16 we are priests of the gospel of God. We all need to declare, &ldquo;I am a priest of the gospel of God!&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING A BOOK OF THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>In the New Testament, two different Greek words are translated into the word <em>priesthood.</em> In Hebrews 7:12 the priesthood refers to the priestly office or the priestly service. In 1 Peter 2:5 and 9 the priesthood refers to the assembly of priests, the corporate body of priests that form a &ldquo;hood.&rdquo; The New Testament priests should not be individualistic, but they should be a corporate body of priests. They do not serve individualistically but corporately. We need to look at the type in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, the priests of Aaron&rsquo;s house served as a corporate body. There was no individualistic priestly service. The priestly body carries out the priestly service. In other words, we may say that the priesthood carries out the priesthood. This priesthood occupies a great place in the entire Bible. It is a great topic in both the Old and New Testaments. We may consider that the entire Bible of sixty-six books is a book of the priesthood. The Bible is absolutely a record of the priesthood from the time that the children of Israel were brought to Mount Sinai and began to build up and set up the tabernacle through the entire New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Being a Priest</h2>
<p>To say that a priest is a person who serves God is right, but this understanding is too shallow. We need to understand the meaning of being a priest in a deeper way. In God&rsquo;s creation of man, we can see the qualifications of a priest. The Bible, which is a book on the priesthood, reveals that God created man with the view that He could have a priesthood, a priestly body, to serve Him. God created man with four particular characteristics. First, He created man in His image that man might bear His likeness, expressing Him. Second, He gave man His authority for His dominion, which indicates that man is His representative (Gen. 1:26). Man expresses and represents God. Third, He created man with a spirit, and this spirit in Genesis 2:7 is called &ldquo;the breath of life.&rdquo; The Hebrew word for &ldquo;breath&rdquo; is the same word for &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; in Proverbs 20:27, which says, &ldquo;The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord.&rdquo; Our God-created human spirit is an organ to contact God and to receive God. Fourth, God put man in front of the tree of life, indicating that God desired to have a man to receive Him as the tree of life so that man might live God. God created man to make man His expression and His representative, creating within man an organ so that man could contact Him and receive Him as life that man might live God. These are the four particular characteristics that show God&rsquo;s desire in His creation of man. A priest is a person who bears these four particular characteristics.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Priesthood after Man&rsquo;s Fall</h2>
<p>We know that man fell, but God did not give man up. Man was created to bear the image of God, to have the dominion of God, to contact and receive God, and to have God as his life to live God, but after the fall, man needs something more. Although man has a human spirit as an organ to contact God, he cannot contact God because there is a great obstacle between him and God. This obstacle is sin. Sin has to be dealt with, and sin has to be taken away. Then a fallen person can contact God, can receive God, and can have God as life. In addition to the four particular characteristics in God&rsquo;s creation of man, God added something after man&rsquo;s fall. After the fall of man, there is the need of offering sacrifices to solve the problem of man&rsquo;s sin. All of the animal sacrifices offered by man in the Old Testament were types of the coming Christ, pointing to the coming of Christ as our Redeemer.</p>
<p>The biblical record does not tell us whether Adam did this or not, but the Bible does tell us that Adam&rsquo;s son Abel, the second generation of mankind, offered sacrifices to God for his acceptance by God (Gen. 4:4). Abel was an individual priest. Although there was not the term <em>priest</em> at that time, Abel acted as a priest. A priest is a person who offers the sacrifices typifying Christ to God. Later, the Bible tells us that God judged the earth with a great flood, which issued in a new world. After the judgment of the flood, Noah built an altar and offered sacrifices to God, which became a sweet smelling savor to God (Gen. 8:20-21). Noah was also an individual priest. Through man&rsquo;s offering of these sacrifices, God could accept fallen man, and man could contact God.</p>
<p>Later in the history of mankind, the Bible tells us that God called Abraham out of the world of idols to a new land, the land of Canaan. In this land, Abraham built an altar and offered sacrifices to God (Gen. 12:7-8). Genesis 22 tells us that God eventually asked Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a burnt offering (v. 2). When Abraham was about to offer his son, God stopped him and provided a ram as a replacement for Isaac (v. 13). That ram was a type of Christ as our burnt offering for our acceptance by God. From this fellowship, we can see that Abel, Noah, and Abraham were individual priests because they offered something to God. Before God ordained the formal, official priesthood at Mount Sinai, there were individuals offering sacrifices to God already.</p>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s descendants eventually became the nation of Israel, and God delivered them out of the tyranny of Egypt and brought them to Mount Sinai. There God revealed His intention for the children of Israel to be a kingdom of priests to Him (Exo. 19:6). God intended for the entire nation of Israel to be a priesthood, but because of the worship of the golden calf (Exo. 32:1-6), they lost the priesthood, and only the tribe of Levi was chosen to replace the whole nation of Israel as priests to God (Exo. 32:25-29; Deut. 33:8-10). Out of the tribe of Levi, God set apart the house of Aaron to be the priesthood. The other Levites helped by serving the priesthood in practical affairs. The entire Old Testament is a record of the priesthood.</p>
<p>The Old Testament reveals that a priest should be a person bearing the image of God, expressing God, having the dominion of God, representing God, and exercising his spirit to contact God, to receive God as his life, so that he might live God. A priest also offers the sacrifices which typify Christ to God for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. A priest is a person ministering God, bringing God to man and bringing man to God. Therefore, he must be a person very close to God, that is, one with God. He knows the heart of God, and he speaks God&rsquo;s will, God&rsquo;s way, and God&rsquo;s plan. Such a person is a priest doing the priestly service in the Old Testament priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Priesthood in the New Testament</h2>
<p>The New Testament begins with John the Baptist. He was born in a miraculous way to Zachariah and Elizabeth. His father Zachariah was a priest, and John the Baptist was born a priest. Thus, the New Testament begins with a priest. We may think that the New Testament begins with Jesus Christ, but actually the record of the New Testament begins with a person who was born a priest.</p>
<p>Now we need to consider how the New Testament ends. The book of Revelation, a book of twenty-two chapters, is the concluding book of the New Testament. Revelation 1:5b-6 says, &ldquo;To Him who loves us and has loosed us from our sins by His blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.&rdquo; According to the grammar of these verses, &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; and &ldquo;priests&rdquo; are in apposition to each other. Therefore, the priests are the kingdom. Revelation 5:9-10 says that we were purchased to God by the blood of Christ out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and we were made priests to our God. Revelation 20 tells us that in the millennium all the overcomers will be co-kings with Christ, and these co-kings of Christ will be the priests of God and of Christ who will reign with Him a thousand years (v. 6). Eventually, all the believers will participate in the priesthood for eternity in the New Jerusalem, in which we will serve Him as priests (22:3). In the New Jerusalem, we shall also reign with Christ in the kingship (22:5). The priests who compose the New Jerusalem will undoubtedly have the four characteristics of man in God&rsquo;s creation of man. They will be people bringing God to man and bringing man to God, and they will be absolutely one with God. Day and night they will be living a life in Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection, and ascension. From this brief fellowship, I hope we can see that the entire Bible talks about the priesthood.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TURN OF THE PRIESTHOOD<br />
FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT TO THE NEW TESTAMENT IN JOHN THE BAPTIST</h2>
<p>Now we need to see the turn of the priesthood from the Old Testament to the New Testament in John the Baptist. John&rsquo;s father was a priest named Zachariah, who was serving in the priesthood according to the Old Testament. He and his wife Elizabeth were both advanced in age (Luke 1:5-7). Elizabeth could not have a child, so Zachariah prayed for his wife to bear him a son, and the Lord heard him (v. 13). God performed a miracle by giving them a son whose name was John. He answered their prayer not only according to their will but also according to His economy.</p>
<p>John was born a priest. Zachariah surely was happy that he had a son who could become his successor in the priesthood. According to God&rsquo;s regulation in the Old Testament, a priest began an apprenticeship at the age of twenty-five (Num. 8:24), and he learned how to practice the priesthood for five years. Then at the age of thirty, he became a formal priest (Num. 4:3). Zachariah and Elizabeth surely expected to see their son enter into an apprenticeship at the age of twenty-five to learn how to be a priest and eventually become a priest at the age of thirty.</p>
<p>The ordinances of the Old Testament priesthood had already been formed and established, but John the Baptist did not live or work according to this religious and cultured way (Matt. 3:1-6). Since John the Baptist was born a priest, he should have remained in the temple, which would have been a joy to his father Zachariah. This is what Samuel did in the Old Testament when he was a child (1 Sam. 2:18). Instead, John the Baptist stayed in the wilderness, a &ldquo;wild&rdquo; place where there was no culture or religion. John the Baptist should have worn the priestly robe, but instead he wore a garment of camel&rsquo;s hair (Matt. 3:4). The camel was considered to be unclean under the Levitical regulations. This garment of camel&rsquo;s hair would have offended all the priests. Furthermore, John the Baptist did not eat the priestly food, which was composed mainly of fine flour and the meat of the sacrifices offered to God by His people (Lev. 2:1-3; 6:16-18, 25-26; 7:31-34). Instead, his food was locusts and wild honey, not cultivated honey (Matt. 3:4). Even the honey that he ate was wild.</p>
<p>John should have performed the priestly service, to offer bulls and goats as sacrifices, to arrange the showbread in the Holy Place, to trim the lamps for the light, and to burn the incense to God. Instead, he worked wildly, baptizing people into water. What John did as a work was rough and wild. People went to John from Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the districts of the Jordan. He told them to repent for the kingdom of the heavens. After they repented, he &ldquo;threw&rdquo; them into the water. This was a wild activity. No one in history had ever baptized people into water until John came. Zachariah and Elizabeth could have thought that their son John was &ldquo;naughty.&rdquo; Instead of serving with Zachariah in the temple, he stayed in a wild place, wore wild clothing, ate wild food, and did a wild work. This surely offended the Old Testament priesthood.</p>
<p>In John the Baptist, we see the turn of the priesthood from the Old Testament to the New Testament. The Old Testament was officially and formally ordained by God, and it had been practiced for many, many years. With John the Baptist, however, everything was uncivilized, uncultured, and not according to the religious regulations of the Old Testament priesthood. In the eyes of God, the Old Testament priesthood lasted until John the Baptist. John&rsquo;s work indicated that he did not want anything to do with the holy temple, the holy clothing, the holy diet, and the holy sacrifices of the Old Testament. The Old Testament priests handled the offerings, washed at the laver, and entered the Holy Place to arrange the showbread, tend the lampstand, and burn the incense before God at the incense altar. This service was very cultured and religious, but John the Baptist gave this up. With him there was no culture or religion. Everything was new with him. Where he lived, what he wore, what he ate, and how he worked ended the Old Testament priesthood.</p>
<p>John the Baptist denied the entire Old Testament priesthood, but his work was the beginning of the priesthood in the New Testament (Mark 1:1-4). He preached the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins as the gospel of Jesus Christ. His ministry was &ldquo;the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God&rdquo; (Mark 1:1). He did not offer bulls and goats as sacrifices (Heb. 10:1-4), but he offered sinners saved through his preaching as sacrifices (Mark 1:5). John the Baptist brought people to Christ as the One stronger than he was and as the One baptizing the repentant people in the Holy Spirit for imparting life (Mark 1:7-8). The first New Testament priest of the gospel of God was John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Lord Jesus. He was the ending of the Old Testament priesthood and the beginning of the New Testament priesthood. From the time of John the Baptist, the priesthood is no longer busy with animal sacrifices. From that time on, the New Testament priesthood is busy with the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the gospel of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Qualifications of the Priesthood</h2>
<p>According to our realization, to preach the gospel is an easy thing, but we need to see that the gospel preachers are New Testament priests who should bear the four particular characteristics in God&rsquo;s creation of man. As priests, we must also be persons very close to God. We must be persons who are one with God, who know God&rsquo;s will, God&rsquo;s heart, and who receive God&rsquo;s oracle to speak for God. Then we must be those who bring God to man to impart God into man and who bring man back to God to make man one with God. All these items are our qualifications for the priesthood.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, more items were added to the priesthood. A New Testament priest should be a person who lives Christ in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension. In the Old Testament, there were items typifying Christ, but they were not Christ in actuality in His death, resurrection, and ascension. Paul was a pattern of the New Testament priests of the gospel of God. He was a person bearing God&rsquo;s image, expressing God, and having God&rsquo;s authority, representing God. He was a person who always exercised his spirit. In the New Testament, he taught much concerning our human spirit, and he used his spirit to contact God, to receive God. He enjoyed Christ as the life-giving Spirit in his spirit, and he enjoyed Christ as his life. In Philippians 3 he expressed his desire to know Christ and the power of His resurrection that he might be conformed to the death of Christ. This shows us that a New Testament priest should be a person in the experience of Christ&rsquo;s death and in the enjoyment of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection power. If we do not have all these items, we are not qualified to preach the gospel because every gospel preacher must be a priest. We all have to see this revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Offering Up Spiritual Sacrifices</h2>
<p>We are the New Testament priests, and this priesthood is not composed of a minority of the saints as a clergy that becomes a hierarchy. The very priesthood the New Testament reveals to us is a universal priesthood. This means that every saint, every believer, is a priest. We may know that we are priests, yet do we know what we should offer to God? A priest of God, a serving one of God, serves God with something that touches God&rsquo;s heart. In the Old Testament, all the priests offered bulls and goats typifying Christ. They offered these as a sweet smelling savor to God. This was what God&rsquo;s heart desired in the Old Testament. Nothing pleased God&rsquo;s heart as much as the types of Christ, pointing to the coming Christ. Today in the New Testament, as the New Testament priests, what shall we do that can please God&rsquo;s heart?</p>
<p>I have told the saints that we need to come to the meetings with Christ, with the surplus of Christ, with the riches of Christ, to offer Christ to God. In this way, we can exhibit Christ. I even wrote a hymn that says, &ldquo;Let us exhibit Christ&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #864). First Peter 2:5 tells us that we are being built up &ldquo;into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In the past, we pointed out that the sacrifices we offer to God are Christ as the reality of all the sacrifices of the Old Testament types, our praises, and the things we do for God (Heb. 13:15-16; Phil. 4:18). This is according to a note on &ldquo;spiritual sacrifices&rdquo; in 1 Peter 2:5 in the Recovery Version of the New Testament. My note on this verse, however, is not complete. We need to add something further to the note on this verse. We need to see something further in the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Today the Lord has given us further light concerning the spiritual sacrifices we should offer to God. This further light is in Romans 15:16. Paul told us in Romans 15:16 that he was a priest of the gospel who offered the Gentiles saved through his preaching as sacrifices to God. These are not the material sacrifices but the spiritual sacrifices.</p>
<p>In order to see what the spiritual sacrifices are in 1 Peter 2:5, we also need to read verse 9: &ldquo;But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.&rdquo; The priesthood mentioned here is the priestly body, the group of priests. To be called out of darkness into His marvelous light is God&rsquo;s salvation. God&rsquo;s mercy, God&rsquo;s grace, God&rsquo;s love, God&rsquo;s patience, God&rsquo;s forgiveness, God&rsquo;s kindness, etc. are God&rsquo;s virtues. In His many virtues, God called us out of darkness and brought us into His marvelous light. To tell out God&rsquo;s virtues is the preaching of the gospel of God&rsquo;s salvation in His virtues according to our experiences. The spiritual sacrifices mentioned in 1 Peter 2:5 are the results of our telling out, the results of our preaching. The results of our preaching are the saved sinners. Verse 9 tells us that we, the priesthood, should tell out the very salvation we have experienced. That means we have to tell people how God has saved us. Then this telling out will result in sinners being saved. By this telling out, we make sinners sacrifices and offer them to God as spiritual sacrifices for His acceptance. There are spiritual sacrifices to offer to God because there is the telling out, the preaching, of God&rsquo;s wonderful salvation in all His virtues. Now we can see that the spiritual sacrifices are the persons saved by God&rsquo;s wonderful salvation through His virtues.</p>
<p>The main sacrifices of the Old Testament priesthood were bulls and goats as types of Christ. Now in the New Testament, the main sacrifices are not only Christ but also Christ with the saved sinners. The main offerings of the Old Testament priests were types of Christ, but the main offering of the New Testament priests is Christ experienced by the sinners. The sinners are offered to God in Christ, with Christ, and one with Christ as the very enlargement of Christ. In the New Testament, Christ is still offered to God, not in typology but in experience. Today we do not have a Christ in typology. The Christ that we have is in our experience. We are saved not only in Christ but also into Christ, so we all have been made good sacrifices. The New Testament priesthood offers sinners saved into Christ as the main sacrifices.</p>
<p>The New Testament priesthood is not merely a few individual saints but a universal priesthood, a priestly body, telling out the virtues of Him who called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. This telling out is the preaching of the gospel of God&rsquo;s salvation in all His virtues, to make the saved sinners spiritual sacrifices offered to God for His acceptance. We have to offer these sacrifices every day. This means that the preaching of the gospel of God is the daily life of a priest of the gospel in the New Testament.</p>
<p>As believers in Christ, we are priests of the gospel of God. According to Romans 15:16, such a priest is a ministering priest, a working priest, an energizing priest. We can also say that such a priest is a priest of the preaching of the gospel. We may admit that we are priests of the gospel, but do we preach the gospel? The work of the priesthood is a daily work. The Old Testament priests offered the offerings every day, morning and evening. They also offered many offerings during special times such as the festivals. This shows us that we need to offer spiritual sacrifices to God at all times and on all occasions. We need to be priests of the gospel of God in our daily life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Entire Book of Romans</h2>
<p>In order to function as priests of the gospel of God, we need to see what the gospel of God is. In Romans 1:1, Paul said that he was &ldquo;separated to the gospel of God.&rdquo; Then in 15:16 he said that he was a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, an energizing priest of the gospel of God. A minister of Christ Jesus is one who serves people with Christ. He ministers Christ to people like a waiter in a restaurant serves people with food. The Apostle Paul was such a minister, serving people with Christ. Such a minister is an energizing priest of the gospel of God.</p>
<p>The gospel of God is the entire book of Romans, comprising sixteen chapters. When I was young, I considered that only the first three chapters of Romans were concerning the gospel. From verse 18 of chapter one through verse 20 of chapter three we see God&rsquo;s condemnation on ungodly and unrighteous mankind. Because all of us are sinners, we need the Lord Jesus&rsquo; redemption. Therefore, the end of chapter three reveals that we are justified by faith and redeemed in Christ. In the past I considered that chapters four through sixteen of Romans were not the preaching of the gospel but were words of edification. I do not think many consider that Romans 12 is the preaching of the gospel. In our consideration Romans 12 is for our edification. Chapter sixteen is a chapter that reveals the local churches (vv. 1, 4, 5, 16, 23). We may not consider that this chapter is the gospel, but Paul indicates that the entire book of Romans is the gospel of God.</p>
<p>The book of Romans begins with the person of Christ, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh and was designated the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead (1:3-4). Thus, the gospel of God begins from the person of Christ, who is both God and man. Romans also speaks concerning Christ&rsquo;s redemption and our faith to receive Christ. Then it continues to tell us how we are sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified. Finally, Romans reveals that we, the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed ones, become the members of Christ constituting His Body, which is expressed on this earth in many localities. Thus, the gospel of God comprises Christ, His redemption, our faith, our being redeemed, our being transformed, our becoming the members of Christ, how Christ&rsquo;s Body is constituted, and how His Body is expressed on this earth in many localities.</p>
<p>In chapter one of Romans, we see Christ as a wonderful person with two natures&mdash;divine and human. In the last chapter, we see all the local churches. In my youth, I thought that there was not much need for Romans 16, but later I realized the great importance of this chapter. Without chapter sixteen, we would not have the result of God&rsquo;s gospel. The gospel of God eventually issues in the local churches. The beginning of the gospel of God is Christ, and the consummation of the gospel of God is the local churches. Thus, the gospel of God comprises everything from Christ&rsquo;s person with two natures to the local churches. These local churches are the issue of the dispensing of Christ&rsquo;s person with His divine and human nature. This One is dispensed into God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people to make them members of the Body of Christ as the church of God, which is expressed around the globe as the local churches. All sixteen chapters of the book of Romans talk about one thing&mdash;Christ and the church.</p>
<p>The span of the gospel of God is so broad. It comprises Christ from eternity and all the local churches on the six continents. Today we should preach such a gospel. Our preaching must be a work that issues in and includes all the local churches. Our preaching work includes setting up local churches and also taking care of all the troubles in the local churches. Many of the troubles in the local churches have to be dealt with by the co-workers and the elders. Our preaching of the gospel includes taking care of all these troubles. We all need to be participants in the preaching of the gospel of God.</p>
<p>The book of Romans shows us that the preaching of the gospel is not merely the winning of souls. When we preach the gospel we make sinners the sons of God and the members of Christ, and we help them to grow so that they can be the active members in the practice of the Body life. Whatever Paul did was his service in the gospel. This is why Paul told us in Romans 1:9, &ldquo;For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son.&rdquo; The preaching of the gospel of God is the very service we should render to God in our spirit. To serve God is to handle the gospel, and to handle the gospel is to preach the gospel in order that Christ might be imparted to others, dispensed to others, that others might become the members of Christ, that Christ&rsquo;s Body might be constituted, and that many local churches could be raised up for His Body to be expressed in many localities. This is the preaching of the gospel, and this is the New Testament service, which is called the New Testament priesthood.</p>
<p>From this fellowship we can see that the preaching of the gospel of God is a profound and deep matter. We have been short in our understanding concerning the preaching of the all-inclusive gospel of God. We must be enlightened, and we must be adjusted in our thinking and in our consideration concerning our service. Our service should be the biblical gospelizing, beginning from Christ&rsquo;s person and consummating in the local churches.</p>

<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>Surely the gospel of God comprises the entire book of Romans, but we need a further enlargement of our definition of the gospel of God. It is not only the entire book of Romans but also the entire twenty-seven books of the New Testament, from Matthew to Revelation. The gospel of God is the good news. It is something told to us to make us happy. The entire New Testament is the &ldquo;happy telling&rdquo; that comes to us from God. The good news of God is the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. This is God&rsquo;s gospel, the good news, the glad tidings, the happy telling of God to us. The twenty-seven books of the New Testament are a testament. A testament is a will. Before someone dies, he writes a will to bequeath certain things to his loved ones. Our will is quite long; it is from Matthew to Revelation. God&rsquo;s good news is a testament, a will, and this testament is the gospel of God. The gospel of God is God&rsquo;s entire New Testament economy.</p>
<p>The term <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy</em> is new among today&rsquo;s Christians, so we need to be clear about the definition of this term. The English word <em>economy</em> is anglicized from the Greek word <em>oikonomia. Oikonomia</em> is composed of two words&mdash;<em>oikos</em> meaning house, and <em>nomos</em> meaning law or administration. Thus, <em>economy</em> means a household administration, and it also bears the meaning of a plan or of an arrangement. With any kind of administration, there is the need of a plan to accomplish something. According to the biblical usage, <em>economy</em> means a household administration with a certain plan for the distribution of the riches to the household for their daily need. In ancient times a great and rich family was in need of an administration with a certain plan to distribute all the riches of the family to all the family members. A good example of this is Joseph in the Old Testament. The entire kingdom of Egypt was considered as Pharaoh&rsquo;s house. For this house Joseph was a dispenser. Joseph was the one who carried out a household administration with a certain plan for the distribution of the rich food. This describes the biblical usage of the word <em>economy</em>.</p>
<p>Even in the Old Testament, God&rsquo;s economy was for dispensing, or distribution, to dispense the riches of God to His chosen people. God has only one economy. The first stage of this economy is in the Old Testament. God carried out His economy in the Old Testament in typology. In the Old Testament, the shadow of God&rsquo;s economy was there. This shadow eventually became the reality, which is the New Testament economy.</p>
<p>In His New Testament economy, the Triune God was incarnated in the Son to become a man. This Man&rsquo;s name was Jesus. He was both God and man, and He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. Much of the time He stayed in Nazareth in a carpenter&rsquo;s home. He was even called a carpenter (Mark 6:3), which indicates that He did carpentry work. Later, He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death to solve all the problems between man and God and to take away all the negative things from the universe. Then He entered into resurrection, and in resurrection He did two marvelous things. First, He resurrected all His believers together with Him (Eph. 2:6). Second, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) to enter into our spirit to be our life. By doing this He made us, the sinners, on the one hand, the sons of the living God (Gal. 3:26), and on the other hand, the members of the organic Body of Christ (Rom. 12:4-5), which is the fullness of Christ as the very expression of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22-23). This Body is built up organically and expressed on this earth in many localities. These expressions are the local churches.</p>
<p>This church will be purged, purified, for one thousand years in the coming millennium. The thousand-year kingdom will be used by God to purify the church, or the churches. The Epistles of the New Testament and the epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 reveal the miserable condition of the churches. Thus, there is the need of some purging. We cannot say that we are so pure. We need a great amount of purifying. In the God-ordained purification, a good amount of purging is included. To purge implies punishment and discipline. The thousand-year kingdom will be used by the Lord to purge His present church, or churches. Eventually, after the purging, the purged and purified church will consummate in the New Jerusalem. In that consummation the Triune God in His processed Trinity will be one with His redeemed people in their transformed, tripartite being. Then the processed Triune God and the transformed, tripartite man will be a universal and eternal couple (Rev. 21:2; 22:17). God and man will not only live together but also be mingled together as the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>The first item of the New Testament is Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, and the final item is the New Jerusalem. The incarnation of Christ is a wonderful item. The very God entered into the womb of a young virgin and remained there for nine months to be born as a God-man. The last item of the New Testament, the New Jerusalem, tells us that the Triune God, after passing through all the processes, is now in myriads of His believers. The New Jerusalem is the highest consummation of the divine incarnation. Incarnation is the mingling of God with man, and the New Jerusalem is the mingling of God with man. God&rsquo;s glad tidings, His all-inclusive gospel, is that God enters into us to be mingled with us and to be one with us for eternity. Every part, every aspect, and every item of the all-inclusive gospel of God is God coming into man, God mingling Himself with man, and God being one with man to be man&rsquo;s life for man to become His living. All twenty-seven books of the New Testament are the glad tidings. Everything covered from Christ&rsquo;s incarnation to the New Jerusalem are the glad tidings, the gospel, that God gave to us.</p>
<p>By this fellowship we can see what God desires to do in His New Testament economy. The Triune God desired to be incarnated in the Son to be a man, to die on the cross to solve all the problems, and to enter into resurrection to produce the sons of God as the members of Christ who constitute the Body of Christ, which is the church to be expressed around the globe as the local churches. All these churches will be purged in the thousand years and will consummate in the New Jerusalem, which is the consummation of the processed Triune God in His economy. This is a summary of what our Triune God wants to carry out in His New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Now we have made two things clear&mdash;God&rsquo;s gospel and God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is God&rsquo;s gospel. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and the gospel of God are synonyms. The gospel is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and to preach such a gospel is the New Testament ministry. To preach Christ until His Body is constituted and expressed in different localities that many local churches will be raised up is to preach the gospel of God, which equals God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. To carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is the preaching of the gospel, and this preaching, evangelizing, or gospelizing, is the New Testament ministry.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 3:1-4; Mark 1:1-4; Heb. 10:1-4; Mark 1:5, 7-8; Rom. 15:16; Rev. 1:5b-6; 5:9-10; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; 1 Tim. 1:16; Rom. 12:1; Col. 1:28-29</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see three crucial matters concerning the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament. First, we need to see what it means to carry out the priesthood in the reality of the New Testament. Second, we need to see how the Apostle Paul functioned as the unique pattern of the priests of the gospel in the New Testament. Third, we want to see the defects of the big gospel preaching meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARRYING OUT THE PRIESTHOOD<br />
IN THE REALITY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The Old Testament priesthood is a shadow of the New Testament priesthood, and the New Testament priesthood is the reality of the Old Testament priesthood. Just as a photograph of a person is a picture of that person, so the Old Testament priesthood is a picture of the New Testament priesthood.</p>
<p>According to the picture of the Old Testament priesthood, the priests&rsquo; work is mainly to offer the sacrifices. Day by day, morning and evening, the priests were always offering sacrifices of bulls and goats. We have seen that our priestly duty in the New Testament is to offer saved sinners to God as spiritual sacrifices for His acceptance (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5). The sacrifices in the Old Testament were offered outside of the tabernacle in the outer court, but the priests&rsquo; work did not stop with the offering of these sacrifices. The priests had another category of work in the Holy Place. They had to enter into the Holy Place to arrange the showbread, to tend the lampstand so that it could shine continually, and to burn the incense. These duties were the work within the tabernacle, not in the open air of the outer court.</p>
<p>In the New Testament priesthood, we take care of these duties in the Holy Place in their reality. The showbread in typology typifies Christ as the food of God&rsquo;s people. He is our life supply. In the Gospel of John, Jesus the Son of God told us in chapter six that He is the bread of life (v. 35). As the bread of life, He said, &ldquo;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me&rdquo; (John 6:57b). Christ is our food, and He is eatable. We can eat Him and live by Him. To arrange the showbread is to show forth Christ as the life supply to God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>We can see the arranging of the showbread in every book of the New Testament. We can use the book of Romans to illustrate this. In Romans 5&mdash;8 Paul was showing forth Christ. In chapter five Paul shows us that Christ is the sphere and the element in which we can have the divine life and escape death. We were born in Adam, who was the sphere and element of death, but through regeneration we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ. In Romans 5 we are told that we are now in Christ, and in this Christ, who is our sphere and element, we have life. In chapter six Paul shows us that Christ is the One who was crucified and resurrected and that He included us in His crucifixion and resurrection. He is the very Christ in death and in resurrection to be our share, our portion, that we may partake of Him, enjoy Him, and experience Him. This is surely Christ as the showbread. In chapter eight Paul shows us Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwelling us and interceding for us. He shows us a wonderful Christ who is in the heavens and at the same time within us. Even in Romans, Paul was arranging the showbread.</p>
<p>Peter also arranged the showbread in his Epistles. First Peter 2:2 says, &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation.&rdquo; This verse shows us Christ as the milk of the word which we can drink in order to be nourished and grow in life. In 2:5 and 9, Peter shows us that we are a holy priesthood and a royal priesthood. He also shows us that Christ is the living stone and that by coming to Him, He makes us living stones. When we contact Him, He imparts His life into us to make us living as He is living. He is the living stone, and we are the living stones. Is not Peter&rsquo;s fellowship here the showing of Christ to us? By these illustrations from the writings of Paul and Peter, we can see that nearly every chapter of the New Testament is the arranging of the showbread.</p>
<p>The lampstand in the tabernacle and the temple typifies Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, as the light of the world. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; Our enjoyment of Christ as life at the showbread table issues in our enjoying Him as the light of the lampstand. The life and the light are one. Furthermore, in Revelation 1 the seven local churches are the seven golden lampstands, and the Lord Jesus as the High Priest is trimming all the local churches to make them shine better. Nearly every chapter of the New Testament is the trimming of the lampstand. When I am ministering the word, I am trimming the lampstand. When the saints are giving testimonies, I have the consciousness many times that they are trimming me. By listening to the saints&rsquo; experiences of Christ, I am enlightened. These testimonies are like a sharp two-edged sword to divide my soul from my spirit (Heb. 4:12). Because I experience this trimming in the meetings, I shine better.</p>
<p>The New Testament also shows us the reality of the priestly burning of the incense. In many of his Epistles, Paul told the saints that he prayed for them, and he asked them to pray for him. This is the reality of burning the incense to God.</p>
<p>Displaying the showbread, trimming the lamp, and burning the incense are all done in the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God. In the New Testament, Christ is the dwelling place of God (John 1:14; Col. 2:9), the church is the dwelling place of God (Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Cor. 3:16), and our spirit is the dwelling place of God (Eph. 2:22; 2 Tim. 4:22). Our God as the Spirit dwells in our spirit. We display Christ as the showbread to feed people, we trim the lampstand, and we burn the incense in Christ, in the church, and in our spirit. Paul wrote all of his Epistles in his spirit. He was performing his priestly service in the tabernacle.</p>
<p>To carry out the New Testament priesthood is to preach the gospel. We have seen that the New Testament ministry to carry out God&rsquo;s economy is the preaching of the all-inclusive gospel of God. Included in this gospel are the three small, practical points of arranging Christ as the showbread, trimming the saints in the churches to make Christ shine through them with the sevenfold Spirit of God, and burning the incense in prayer to God. To preach the gospel is to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is His all-inclusive gospel, and to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to fulfill the New Testament priesthood, the priestly service.</p><h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE PATTERN OF THE PRIESTS<br />
OF THE GOSPEL IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The unique pattern of the priests of the gospel in the New Testament is the Apostle Paul (1 Tim. 1:16). We need to see how Paul did his work as a priest of the gospel. According to the New Testament record, he did it in three steps of offering. First, Paul saved sinners to offer them up to God as acceptable sacrifices (Rom. 15:16). Second, he brought the believers up to lead them to present themselves to God as living sacrifices (Rom. 12:1). Third, he warned and taught every saint in all wisdom to present each one full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28-29). He did this by laboring and struggling according to God&rsquo;s operation which operated in him in power. Paul&rsquo;s announcing of Christ in Colossians 1:28 is to tell out Christ. To present every man full-grown in Christ is to offer every man full-grown in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Saving Sinners to Offer Them to God<br />
as Acceptable Sacrifices</h2>
<p>According to Romans 15:16, Paul offered the saved sinners to God as acceptable sacrifices. All of the unbelieving sinners are in Adam. When we preach the gospel to them and they receive the Lord, they are transferred out of Adam into Christ. When someone believes into Christ, he becomes a part of Christ. The unbelievers who are transferred into Christ are the increase of Christ. When I am preaching the gospel to offer saved persons to God, I am offering Christ&mdash;not the individual Christ but the corporate Christ. In the Old Testament, the priests offered bulls and goats as sacrifices. God was pleased with that because they were types of the coming Christ. Our work today in the New Testament age is to preach the gospel to save sinners, to make them parts of Christ. When we offer these ones to God, God considers them as parts of Christ. Thus, we are offering the increase of Christ to God. Because we are members of Christ, we can say that we are Christ. Paul said in Philippians 1:21, &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ.&rdquo; When we were offered to God, we were offered to God as Christ.</p>
 <p>The bulls and goats that the Old Testament priests offered to God were types. They were not the reality. The reality of these offerings is Christ. God was happy with the offerings in the Old Testament because they pointed to the coming Christ, but today we are priests who do not offer the types. We offer the reality, and the reality is not just the individual Christ Himself without any enlargement or increase. We are offering the increase of Christ, the parts of Christ. I am very happy because through my ministry over many years I have offered a number of thousands of people to the Lord as acceptable sacrifices. When I see the Lord, I can give Him an account that I have offered a number of thousands of parts of Himself to Him. We need to consider how many parts of Christ we have offered to the Lord. We all have to answer this question. One day we will see the Lord, and we will have to give Him an account concerning our living and labor on this earth. How many parts of Christ we have offered to Him indicates how much we have labored.</p>
<p>In talking about his labor in the gospel, Paul said in Colossians 1:29, &ldquo;For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.&rdquo; To offer parts of Christ to God requires our labor, but not labor by our own strength or our own ability. We need to struggle according to His operation which operates in us in power. We are the New Testament priests of the gospel of God, so we have to labor on the sinners by imparting God, dispensing God, into them to bring them into Christ, making them parts of Christ which we offer to God as acceptable sacrifices. All of us as the New Testament priests are obligated to do this. One day we will all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and we will have to give the Lord an account.</p>
<p>When we talk about knocking on people&rsquo;s doors for the preaching of the gospel, what we mean is to visit people. We visit people to impart Christ into them. Visiting people to impart Christ into them must be a part of our Christian daily life. In our daily life, we must impart God and dispense Christ into others to make them, the sinners, parts of Christ that we may present these parts as sacrifices offered to God for His good pleasure. This will produce the members of Christ to constitute His Body and eventually issue in this Body being expressed on earth in many localities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bringing the Believers Up to Lead Them<br />
to Present Themselves to God<br />
as Living Sacrifices</h2>
<p>After the saving of sinners, Paul continued to nourish the new ones, to bring them up in the same way that we would raise up our children. When we bring up our children, we first teach them what to do, and after a period of time, we charge them to do it themselves. At the time of their salvation, Paul presented the saved sinners as sacrifices. Then Paul brought them up and led them to present themselves as living sacrifices.</p>
<p>When I preach the gospel to a sinner and he gets saved, he is now in Christ. I present this one to God in Christ, with Christ, and as a part of Christ, as a spiritual sacrifice. Now that he is saved, he is a babe in Christ. I should not leave him alone, but I have to feed him as a nursing mother. After revealing in Romans 1 and 2 that the believers were sinners, Paul did this feeding work in chapters three through eleven. Then in Romans 12, Paul, the feeder, begged the saints to present themselves to God as living sacrifices. Paul did not beg the saints to offer themselves to God in Romans 1. It was after his fellowship through eleven chapters that he could ask the saints in Romans 12 to offer themselves to God as living sacrifices and be His serving members. We have to offer ourselves directly to God, but we do this by being helped, by being perfected, by the preaching apostle. This is the pattern we have to follow.</p>
<p>When people receive the Lord as their life, they are babes. After a period of time of feeding on Christ, they grow and grow in life until, spiritually speaking, they enter into their teens. In a family, the parents cannot give the little children much responsibility, but later the parents can charge them to do things according to their stage of growth. When a child becomes thirteen years old, he comes out of elementary school and enters into junior high school. Paul&rsquo;s charge in Romans 12:1 is something just out of &ldquo;elementary school.&rdquo; The elementary teaching is in Romans 1&mdash;11. Romans 12:1 may be considered as a charge to those who are now &ldquo;thirteen years old.&rdquo; After the long teaching in Romans 1&mdash;11, the children have entered into &ldquo;junior high.&rdquo; Paul offered them as sacrifices to God at their conversion. Now that they are in their &ldquo;teens,&rdquo; he begs them to present themselves to God, to present their bodies as a living sacrifice to God.</p>
<p>After this offering in Romans 12, the practice of the Body life begins. After the saints&rsquo; presentation of themselves to God, they can be the active members of the Body of Christ. Thus, in the following verses of chapter twelve, we see that the ones who present themselves as living sacrifices become functioning members of the organic Body of Christ. These living members function according to their gifts, such as prophecy or teaching (vv. 6-7).</p>
<p>Before Romans 12, there was no practice of the Body life. Beginning in chapter twelve the saints are beginning to be perfected to practice the Body life. After being perfected, the saints will do the same work as the gifted ones&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (Eph. 4:11-12). Even though the saints are not these particular gifts, they will do the same work that these gifts do. This work is the work of the New Testament ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is built directly by the perfected saints, not by the perfecting gifts. This Body is built up and expressed in many localities on this earth as the local churches.</p><h2 class="head2">Warning and Teaching Every Saint in All Wisdom to Present Each One Full-grown in Christ</h2>
<p>Because the believers are still not fully matured, there is the third step of Paul&rsquo;s gospel work in the New Testament priesthood. This third step can be seen in Colossians 1:27-29: &ldquo;To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.&rdquo; What kind of Christ did Paul announce? The Christ whom he announced is not that simple. He announced the indwelling Christ as the hope of glory. Paul announced a wonderful person. Christ as the hope of glory cannot work in us fully without a worker like Paul.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;warning&rdquo; implies that there are troubles, problems, hardships, and mistakes that we can make. Therefore, we need to be warned. Warning also implies admonishing and rebuking. Paul warned and taught every man in all wisdom. &ldquo;In all wisdom&rdquo; means that Paul warned and taught one person in one way and another person in another way. He warned and taught every man face to face. Paul did this so that he could present, or offer, every man full-grown in Christ. Paul did not want to miss anyone, desiring to present every man full-grown.</p>
<p>In Acts 20 Paul said that he taught the saints publicly and from house to house (v. 20). He also said that he admonished each one of the saints for three years night and day with tears (v. 31). Paul went to the homes of the saints to teach them and admonish them one by one. I lived in Anaheim for many years, but I went to very few homes of the saints to visit them. I feel very sorry about this. We have been off in our service due to the traditional concept. Paul said that he taught publicly and that he also taught from house to house. &ldquo;From house to house&rdquo; in Greek means &ldquo;according to houses.&rdquo; Paul taught, admonished, and warned the saints face to face. By this teaching from house to house to admonish each one of the saints, Paul ministered Christ to the saints to cause them to grow in life.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, a full-grown priest had to be thirty years old. A person who was twenty-five years old could only be an apprentice, a learner, in the priesthood. The Lord Jesus began His ministry when He was about thirty years old (Luke 3:23), the full age for God&rsquo;s service (Num. 4:3, 35, 39, 43, 47). We need to labor on others by warning them and teaching them in all wisdom until they are full-grown in Christ. We warn each one and teach each one in many, many ways, that is, in all wisdom. The full-grown, matured saints become the active members of the organic Body of Christ, the parts of Christ. In other words, they all become the corporate Christ. To offer the saints full-grown in Christ is to offer the corporate Christ. In such a condition, they have become parts of Christ in full, the constituents of the corporate Christ.</p>
<p>Because we are not full-grown in Christ, we still need to be warned and taught in all wisdom. We may say that we are parts of the corporate Christ, but are we His parts practically, in our daily life? Do you believe that the parts of the corporate Christ would participate in anything sinful or worldly? Some of us may have grown to the stage of Romans 12:1, the stage of presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice. Romans 12:1, however, is not at the stage of full growth. We have to be helped by the priests who handle us to grow up into the full growth in Colossians 1:28. The apostles who handle us, who serve us with Christ, desire to present us in Christ to God as parts of the corporate Christ.</p>
<p>Paul said that he labored for this by struggling. The Greek word for struggling means fighting, battling, or wrestling. It is not an easy thing to present every man full-grown in Christ. Paul did not labor according to his own ability or strength, but according to Christ&rsquo;s operation which operated in him in power. Christ&rsquo;s indwelling is so that He can operate and move in us in power. The power here is a dynamic power. Christ is working in us, but do we realize and sense that daily, day and night, Christ the living One is indwelling us and operating within us?</p>
<p>Some of the ones who are closest to me remind me to take care of myself in my old age. The ones close to me are concerned for me because they love me, but another One also loves me. This inner One is also operating within me all the time. Every time I go along with His operation, I am energized. The more I speak for the Lord, the stronger I am. We need to labor by struggling according to the One who operates in us, not according to our natural strength. We need to cooperate with the operation of the indwelling Christ. For the carrying out of His New Testament economy, God has done His part. He surely has consummated the works on His side to do everything for us. Now He is operating in us to make us the energizing priests. We have to take care of our part, to fulfill our duty. We may feel that we are weak, that we are nothing, and that we can do nothing, but as long as we are willing to operate, He will be our energizing power. As long as we are willing to do business, He will be our capital. The problem to Him is that we would not be willing to cooperate with Him.</p>
<p>The Lord told us in the New Testament that all of His chosen people, who are today&rsquo;s believers, are His priests (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6; 5:10). No priest can be lazy because every priest has to offer something day by day. Every priest has to be very, very diligent, even aggressive, in offering sacrifices to God. God does not want the sweet smell of the offerings on the altar to stop. He likes this sweet savor to ascend to Him all the time for His acceptance. In Romans 15:16 Paul said that he was a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, an energizing priest of the gospel of God, to offer the nations to God. The main offering of the New Testament priests should be the saved sinners as parts of the enlarged and corporate Christ, offered to God as the New Testament sacrifices of the gospel. In the Old Testament, the main offerings were bulls and goats, which were types of Christ. Today we are offering Christ, but not the individual Christ. We are offering the corporate Christ.</p>
<p>This kind of offering should continue all the time. As the New Testament priests, we have to make the preaching of the gospel a part of our daily life, our daily walk. A priest&rsquo;s daily life and daily work is to offer sacrifices to God. In the Old Testament, the priests offered bulls and goats all day long, morning and evening. This is a type of what we should do. As the New Testament priests, we should offer sinners, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and even conformed to the image of Christ. We should offer these persons as parts of the corporate Christ to God. We should not forget that as believers we are priests and that a priest is always offering something to God. Paul was offering the sinners he saved as sacrifices to God all the time.</p>
<p>We may have experienced Romans 12:1, but we have not reached the state of being full-grown in Colossians 1:28. To be presented to God full-grown in Christ is the last step to finish the sacrifice of the New Testament priesthood. This sacrifice needs three steps: salvation in Romans 15:16, growth in life in Romans 12:1, and the maturity in life in Colossians 1:28. All these steps are the work of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. According to the divine revelation, to save sinners, to teach the Bible, to edify the saints, and to set up churches are all the work of the gospel. The preaching of the gospel of God is the New Testament ministry to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We must bear this responsibility for God&rsquo;s good pleasure.</p>
<p>I have been with many of the saints for years, and I know that they love the Lord. They come to the meetings regularly, year after year. They give a lot for the Lord. In this book I have a real burden to tell all the saints that what I am teaching and preaching here is absolutely new. What most Christians practice, including us, is according to an accumulation of centuries of tradition. What we have practiced is partially according to the Bible and partially not according to the Bible. We all have been drugged by the traditional and unscriptural way of practicing the church life and of Christian service. We need to be sober and reconsider what the Bible says. We should only take the holy Word as our base.</p>
<p>Our gospel preaching today must be the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament. The gospel of God is according to the teaching of the apostles in the New Testament and includes all of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. When the priests in the Old Testament offered bulls and goats, they did not realize that these sacrifices typified Christ in His incarnation, in His human living, in His all-inclusive death, in His resurrection as life, in His coming to us as the life-giving Spirit to indwell us, in His ascension, and in His descension to be one with His saved ones and to make them one Body. Although the Old Testament priests did not realize this, we should realize it because we are in this present New Testament age.</p>
<p>If we do not know these things, we are deficient. Because the Lord has shown me all these things, I am burdened. I do not care for any other work. I am burdened to present to all the saints these new seeings, these new visions, these new lights. The truth concerning the priests of the gospel of God is altogether new to me. I have been teaching the Bible for over sixty years, but this point cannot be found in any of my writings in the past. Thank the Lord that I have seen this matter and that I can present it to all the saints.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEFECTS OF THE BIG<br />
GOSPEL PREACHING MEETING</h2>
<p>The big gospel preaching meeting has defects. I do admit that the big preaching meeting did fulfill and still fulfills the purpose of saving sinners. It fulfills the purpose of soul-winning, but it does not fulfill the purpose of God&rsquo;s economy. Many souls may be saved in a big gospel preaching meeting, but where are they after their salvation? They make little progress in God&rsquo;s economy, and they know very little concerning God&rsquo;s economy. Because of this they cannot fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose in His New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Many real Christians were gained through big gospel preaching meetings. The big gospel preaching meeting fulfills the purpose of saving sinners, but it fosters the building up of the evangelists as a hierarchy of clergy. If we only practice having big gospel preaching meetings for ten years, most of the saints will not know how to preach the gospel. Only the evangelists among us will know how. The more big gospel preaching meetings we have, the more these gifted evangelists get fostered to be the clergy. The big gospel preaching meetings do not develop the believers&rsquo; function of preaching the gospel, but they annul it, making the majority of the believers laity. We may hate any kind of hierarchy and the clergy-laity system, but innocently and unconsciously we are fostering and building them up when we practice having only big gospel preaching meetings.</p>
<p>The evangelists should perfect the saints to preach the gospel as they do. We need the perfecting of the saints by the gifts. Ephesians 4 tells us that the Lord gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints. This means that these gifted persons equip the saints to do the same work that they do. There have been some big evangelists preaching the gospel for many years, but they did not perfect others to preach the gospel. There are millions of Christians in Christianity who do not and who have not been enabled and equipped to preach the gospel. All the believers need to practice the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the big gospel preaching meeting saves sinners, but on the other hand, it annuls the function of the believers in preaching the gospel. This is the subtlety of the enemy. We have been saved by the Lord, and we have the divine life. This divine life has organic functions, and the preaching of the gospel is one of these functions, but we have to ask where this function of preaching the gospel is among us today. This function in many of us has been annulled by the improper practice of preaching the gospel. This improper practice has cheated us.</p>
<p>In the past, the church would announce that there would be a gospel meeting, and the brothers would encourage us to invite people, to bring people, and to prepare a love feast. According to the Old Testament typology, this is not the work of the priests but the work of the Levites. To arrange the chairs, to clean the hall, to sit with the new ones, and to help them find certain things in the Bible are all Levitical services. This is not the priestly preaching of the gospel. Instead of preaching the gospel directly, the saints brought their contacts to the big gospel preaching meeting to hear someone else preach the gospel. Who was preaching the gospel among us? Only a few brothers. That practice fostered the building up of the clergy, and at the same time it killed the organic preaching function of each member. This is why we do not have many real priests of the New Testament gospel among us today. This is the defect of having only big gospel preaching meetings. This is not a deficiency. To be deficient means to be short of something. To practice having only big gospel preaching meetings is defective. To be defective is to be wrong in something.</p>
<p>Most of the members in the major denominations do not preach the gospel and cannot preach the gospel. All of us need to be perfected to preach the gospel, not just a few. I am not against having big meetings for the preaching of the gospel. Sometimes the Lord will use this kind of meeting. The first preaching of the gospel in the New Testament on the day of Pentecost was to a big congregation, but that congregation was not brought together by advertisement, propaganda, or brochures. That congregation was sovereignly prepared by God. Peter took this opportunity to speak the gospel to these people. According to the record of the book of Acts, however, that is not the regular and ordinary preaching of the gospel. The regular and ordinary preaching is in the homes of the believers (Acts 5:42) and is by each of the believers. The common practice of the preaching of the gospel today is not like this. Most conduct big preaching meetings on a regular basis. As a result, the saints do not preach the gospel themselves daily and weekly. Such a practice of having only big gospel preaching meetings regularly annuls the preaching function within all the saints.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, all the believers should preach the gospel because every believer is a priest. The New Testament priests are the priests of the gospel of God. Because we are the priests of the gospel we have the capacity and the obligation to speak the gospel. According to Paul&rsquo;s thought, he owed people the gospel (Rom. 1:14-15). We owe our relatives, our classmates, our neighbors, and our friends the gospel. We owe the gospel to the people in the town where we live. Every dear saint should be stirred up to preach the gospel. We have the capacity to speak the gospel. The more that we speak, the more we will be able to speak.</p>
<p>I learned the English language when I was very young in China, but the environment did not permit me to practice speaking English. I basically learned the English language by reading and writing, not by speaking. I came to the United States when I was about sixty years old, and then I began to speak English. That was very awkward for me, but after twenty-five years of practicing, I can speak much better. I learned that the more I spoke English, the more I was able to speak.</p>
<p>Many dear saints among us have been in the church life for over ten years, but they have never been stirred up to preach the gospel. After ten years of not practicing to preach the gospel, they have become dumb in speaking the gospel. They can only invite people to come to a big gospel meeting. They can prepare a love feast, arrange the chairs, sit by their guests in the meeting, and help them to find the right passage of the Bible and the right hymn in the hymnal. They can take down the names and addresses of the new ones for contacting them in the future, but they do not feel that they can talk to them directly concerning the gospel. Instead of preaching the gospel, they feel that they can only bring their contacts to certain brothers who can explain the gospel in a proper way.</p>
<p>In the past, we thought that preaching the gospel was a church activity in which the whole church was engaged. Actually, however, most of the saints did the Levitical service, not the priestly service. To arrange the chairs for the gospel meeting, to invite people to come, and to give them a ride to the meeting are all part of the Levitical service. That is not the priestly service. A priest of the gospel gets the sinners saved and baptizes them to offer them as sacrifices to God. Our preaching of the gospel has not been prevailing because we have been cheated by the enemy. Our practice has annulled the preaching ability, the preaching capacity, the preaching function, of the saints. We are responsible for this before the Lord. One day we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. The Lord may check with us concerning the fellowship that we have received in this book. The capacity to speak Christ is in the divine life, so we need to enjoy this divine life. This capacity is developed by the growth of life, and this development will be unto an ability. Then the capacity will have become an ability. All of us need to be developed to preach the gospel, to speak the gospel into people&rsquo;s spirits.</p>
<p>Because the Lord has given us the divine life with such a capacity, we are obligated to speak Christ. We are obliged to preach the gospel to our relatives and to our neighbors. We are obliged to preach the gospel to all the people that we know. The more people we know, the more we are obligated. All of us will be checked by the Lord Jesus at the judgment seat. We will not be able to make excuses at the judgment seat of Christ. The Lord will hold us accountable for what we have heard and seen in the New Testament.</p>
<p>It may be all right to practice preaching the gospel with big gospel meetings, but this depends upon whether our practice of preaching in this way annuls or develops the saints&rsquo; ability in preaching the gospel. We have to bear the responsibility for the annulling or for the developing of the saints&rsquo; functions. If we do practice preaching the gospel by big gospel meetings, this should not replace the saints&rsquo; preaching. Instead it should set up a pattern to develop the saints&rsquo; capacity of preaching the gospel. To tell the saints that we do not need to go out to preach the gospel and that all we need to do is bring all our new contacts together for a big gospel meeting is wrong because it annuls the saints&rsquo; function in preaching the gospel. What we do and what we say will be checked at the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p>The obligation to speak Christ is the fulfillment of our spiritual service in which we are indebted to God&rsquo;s salvation. God might check with us in this way: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I give My divine life to you? Have you not been enjoying My life for years? Is not My salvation with My divine life dynamic? Then why would you not fulfill your obligation? You owe Me and My dynamic salvation.&rdquo; How many people we bring to the Lord depends upon how many people God has allowed us to meet. If we have more cousins, we are more obligated. The Lord will check with us concerning how many people we brought to salvation. We cannot tell the Lord that we did not know anyone. The Lord has given us relatives, neighbors, friends, colleagues, and classmates.</p>
<p>It would be good if all of us could take thirty minutes to write down everyone that we know, beginning from our nearest relatives. In Acts 1:8 the Lord told the disciples that they would receive power when the Holy Spirit had come upon them and that they would be His witnesses in Jerusalem, in Judea, in Samaria, and to the remotest part of the earth. In preaching the gospel, our &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; is our parents, our brothers and sisters, and our relatives. I believe that if we write down the names of those we know, beginning from our &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; we will have at least one hundred names. Then we need to check which ones among these one hundred have been saved. We owe the gospel to the ones who have not been saved.</p>
<p>I am concerned about our understanding of the fellowship in this book concerning the New Testament priests of the gospel of God. We should not understand this fellowship in a common way or think that we have heard this before. We may think that we know already that we all have to preach the gospel. I hope that we would not understand the fellowship concerning the priesthood of the gospel in this way. The way that I have presented is particular and unique. It is not the common preaching of the gospel but the preaching of the priests. When we preach the gospel, we are preaching the gospel as the New Testament priests. Our preaching is our priestly service, and we have to make it our daily work and our daily life. We have to make it a part of our being.</p>
<p>To be priests of God without offering sacrifices to God daily is uncomely. We should not preach the gospel merely as Christians. The New Testament tells us that we should preach the gospel as priests doing our priestly service. In Romans 1:9 Paul said that he served God in his spirit in the gospel. Whatever Paul did as service to God was a part of his preaching of the gospel. Paul set up many local churches. His setting up of the churches was a part of his gospelizing as a priest. Because we did not have this enlightenment in the past, we preached the gospel ignorantly.</p>
<p>In presenting this fellowship to you, I appeal to your love of the Lord, to your enlightened conscience, and to your love of the truth. Please reconsider the fellowship in this chapter and the previous chapter. Consider before the Lord all the verses that I have presented regarding the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament. I believe that as you consider before the Lord, the Lord will show you the same vision that I have seen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:1-5; Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:16; John 3:3, 5; 1 Cor. 4:15; 1 Pet. 2:2; Heb. 6:5; 5:13-14; Eph. 4:11-14</h1>
<p>The first crucial item of the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament. We have seen that we all need to be priests of the gospel of God. In this chapter we want to see the second crucial item of the present advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery&mdash;the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We may think that it is easy to understand the organic building up of the Body of Christ, but actually this matter is difficult to define. We may have the terminology of the organic building, but we may not have the proper understanding of what this organic building actually is. Since I began to share on the organic building up of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God beginning in August of 1988 (see <em>The Body of Christ</em> published by Living Stream Ministry), I have listened to the testimonies and fellowship of the saints regarding this matter. Many of the saints have the following concept of what the organic building up of the Body of Christ is. Formerly in our meetings, a certain brother was appointed to share a message, and another brother led us in the reading of the Scriptures. This practice was something formal and something arranged. Many of the saints think that to be organic is to be automatic and spontaneous. This means that we come together without any arrangement, without any schedule, and without any program. When we come together, a sister may suddenly call a hymn, and another sister may read to us a portion of the Word that she enjoyed in morning watch that day. Many of the saints feel that this spontaneous and automatic meeting is organic. If this is organic, however, all the shouting and excitement at sporting events, which are very spontaneous and automatic, are also organic. To be merely automatic and spontaneous is not to be organic. We need to drop this concept.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate the organic building up of the Body of Christ, let us consider the difference between a house and a tree. The house comes into existence by being built up, and the tree comes into being by growing, which is also a building up. Thirteen years ago the trees in my yard were small, but today they are big trees. Organic things are built up by growing. When a tree grows, the tree is being built up, and when a child grows, the child is being built up. For a man or a tree to be built up is organic. To build up a house, however, is not related to life, so that kind of building up is not organic.</p>
<p>A house is built by the adding of more materials. If we want a one-story house to become two stories, we do not put some fertilizer on it and water it. The house does not grow from one story to two stories. The house becomes higher by addition, but a tree becomes higher by growing. By watering and fertilizing a tree, the tree will grow. The organic elements of the water and the fertilizer nourish the tree to cause it to grow in life. A tree also needs to be trimmed in order to grow properly. The proper trimming of the tree results in more growth in life. This growth is the organic building up.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ, like the tree, is organic. It is an organism. Anything that is organic is built up by growing. Just as a tree grows in life, we also need to grow in the divine life to be built up. The organic building up is actually the growing up. The building up of the church is by the believers&rsquo; growing in life.</p>
<p>How much organic building up we have experienced depends upon how much growth in life we have had. The Lord does not want an organization. What the Lord wants is something organic, full of life. Our physical body is altogether a matter of life. The circulation of blood in our body gives life to our body. The Bible tells us that our physical life is in the blood (Lev. 17:11, 14). If the blood supply does not reach a certain part of our body, that part will die. Just as our physical body needs the circulation of the blood, the Body of Christ also needs the circulation of the divine life. Our body is organic, so its building up is organic according to the circulation of life by the growth in life. When Christians talk about the building up of the church, not many think of this building in an organic way. They do not think about the building up of the church in the organic sense, but in the organizational sense. The Lord desires to build up the church organically because the church is the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST, AS THE CHURCH OF GOD,<br />
BEING THE ORGANISM OF THE TRIUNE GOD,<br />
NOT AN ORGANIZATION OF HUMAN BEINGS</h2>
<p>The Body of Christ, as the church of God, is an organism of the Triune God, not an organization of human beings (John 15:1-5). This is strongly proven by the vine tree in John 15. The Lord Jesus said that He is the vine tree and that His Father is the husbandman (v. 1). A tree is not an organization but an organism. The vine tree is the organism of the Triune God. The vine tree is not something organized but something of life that grows up as an organism. Nothing inorganic can be added to an organism like a tree.</p>
<p>A branch can be grafted into a tree if it is of the same family as the tree into which it is grafted. Grafting is altogether an organic matter. According to Genesis 1 all the different kinds of life are after their kind. The human life, however, is after God&rsquo;s kind. Man was made in the image and likeness of God, so man is in the category of God. Because we were made in God&rsquo;s image and likeness, we can be grafted into God (Rom. 11:24; 6:4-5). This grafting brings us into an organic union with God (1 Cor. 6:17). The organism of the Triune God is in this organic union. The church as the Body of Christ is an organism, and the building up of the church as an organism is its organic growth.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is an organism composed of people who have the very God as the Spirit indwelling their spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16). This indwelling of God as the Spirit in our spirit is the mingling of God with us. The very source of life in the entire universe, which is God, is right now in our spirit. Due to this, we are the organism of the Triune God.</p>
<p>According to our human concept, the church is an organization of a group of people, but our mind needs to be renewed to see that the church as the Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God. Our physical body is a living organism of our person for us to live, exist, and express ourselves. Likewise, the church as the Body of Christ is an organism of the divine person, the Triune God, to express the Triune God.</p>
<p>This organism is entirely an entity of life, in the issuing (dispensing) of the processed Triune God. This truth is fully developed and explained in Ephesians 1. Many readers of Ephesians 1 say that they cannot understand it because it is too deep and complicated. However, we have discovered after many years of studying Ephesians 1 that the structure of this chapter is actually very simple. The first section of Ephesians 1 tells us that the Father is dispensing Himself into us through His selection and predestination (vv. 3-6). The second section shows us that the Son is dispensing Himself into us through His redemption to make us God&rsquo;s inheritance (vv. 7-12). The third section shows us that the Spirit is dispensing Himself into us as a seal and as a pledge (vv. 13-14). The final section reveals that the dispensing of the divine Trinity to produce the church as the organism of the Triune God is accomplished by the transmission of the great power of God (vv. 19-23). The Son as the embodiment of the dispensing Triune God entered into resurrection and ascension to become the Head of all things. Verse 22 tells us that in His ascension, Christ is Head over all things to the church. &ldquo;To the church&rdquo; implies a kind of transmission. Whatever Christ, the Head, attained and obtained is transmitted, dispensed, to the church, His Body. The church is the issue of the dispensing Triune God, and this church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all to express the Triune God.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1 reveals that the church is the issue of the Triune God, starting from the Father, passing through the Son, and consummating in the Spirit. The issue, the result, or the coming out, of the Triune God is the church which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. This issue is the Body of the very embodiment of the Triune God. The Triune God has an embodiment, who is Christ, and the issue of the Triune God is the Body of His embodiment. This Christ is universally immense because He fills all in all, and His Body is His fullness. A person&rsquo;s body is his fullness, and this fullness is his expression. Likewise, the church as the fullness of Christ is the expression of Christ. It is altogether something organic that issues out of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The church is the Body of the embodiment of the Triune God, and this Body is the fullness of the unlimited Christ.</p>
<p>The church is an organism not an organization. Anything of life is organic. The work in today&rsquo;s Christianity is not organic. It is a work for organization. We need to work organically for the organic building up of the Body of Christ. An organization is merely a matter of work in the labor of man&rsquo;s doing. We may labor in the gospel according to our doing to &ldquo;win souls&rdquo; and to build up a congregation. There may be many members of this congregation, but they may not know anything about life. The New Testament shows us that the pattern of the priests of the gospel of God is the Apostle Paul. He did his gospel work in the way of life. He told the Corinthians, &ldquo;For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:15). Paul was a father to the Corinthians because he had begotten them in Christ Jesus through the gospel. This kind of gospel work is organic. The gospel is not merely a matter of &ldquo;winning souls,&rdquo; but it is a matter of begetting people. The first step of the organic building is to beget people, to impart the divine life into sinners to make them the sons of the living God and the organic members of the Body of Christ. I may preach the gospel to win souls, and what I preach may be correct doctrinally, but it may be correct with much deficiency. We need to preach the gospel in the way of life. Life is God in Christ as the Spirit. This life enters into us to become our life (Col. 3:4).</p><h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
BEING THE INCREASE OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
IN THE BELIEVERS<br />
FOR THEIR GROWTH IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is the increase of the Triune God in the believers for their growth in Christ. Colossians 2:19 says, &ldquo;Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, by means of the joints and bands being supplied and knit together, grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Grows with the growth of God&rdquo; may also be translated &ldquo;grows with the increase of God.&rdquo; God is increasing in us in essence essentially. It is by this essential increase of God in us that the church as the Body of Christ grows. The church as the Body of Christ grows with some element, with some essence. A person grows with the essence of the food that he takes in. Some may have pointed out that God grows in us in knowledge, but we need to see that God Himself essentially grows in us.</p>
<p>A cup may have water inside of it, but what is the quantity of water within the cup? As the water increases within the cup, the water eventually overflows from the cup. This overflow is the fullness of the water. When the water is overflowing from the cup, the water can be seen. God is within us, but is He overflowing from within us? How much of God is in us? Do we have &ldquo;two gallons&rdquo; of God within us, or is God only within us in a small amount? God needs to increase in us. When I was saved sixty-four years ago, I did not know that God was in me. Eventually, I realized that God was in me, but the very God in me was very small in quantity. I have the assurance that I have much more of God within me than I did sixty-four years ago. This is the increase of God. The organic building up of the church is the increase of God in all the believers.</p>
<p>The Spirit of God is God&rsquo;s divine essence, His divine element. When we receive the Spirit of God, we receive God Himself in His essence. We have received God Himself essentially, but how much of God is within us? God Himself essentially needs to increase in us. This is why we have to be filled with the Spirit. To be filled with the Spirit is to receive God essentially, to let God fill us essentially in full. This is to let God increase within us, to let God grow in us. This essential increase of God in all of us is the growth of the Body of Christ, which is the building up organically of the Body of Christ. The building up of the Body of Christ is the increase of our processed Triune God within us in full essentially.</p>
<p>If we have some maturity in life, we can see that new believers are short of God. They have God within them, but they are short of God in their conversation, in their expression, and in their attitude. They may be good brothers and sisters, but when you listen to them speak, you can sense that they are short of God. They do not have that much of God&rsquo;s element within them, so they need to grow. To grow in life is to have more of God in us.</p>
<p>We need to remember that life is God in Christ as the Spirit. God is life to us in Christ and as the Spirit. When I first met a certain brother, I realized that he was short of God, but today I have the full realization that he has more of God in Christ as the Spirit. Still, this brother needs to grow in life. The growth in life is the increase of God in Christ as the Spirit in us.</p>
<p>We should not have the concept that growth, increase, and building up are three different things. With organic matters such as a tree or a person, growth, increase, and building up are synonyms. They are also synonyms in relation to the organic Body of Christ. They are different terms referring to the same thing. The organic building up of the Body of Christ is the increase of the Triune God in the believers, and this increase is the believers&rsquo; growth in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Organic Building Up of the Body<br />
Being the Growth of the Body</h2>
<p>On the one hand, we are members of the organic Body of Christ, and on the other hand, we are the builders of this Body (Eph. 4:16). We, the members of the Body, are the builders of the Body. The growth of all the members of a man is the building up of this man. If the members of a child&rsquo;s physical body do not grow, he is not being built up. The growing members are the building members. The members of a person&rsquo;s physical body are the builders of his body by their growth. Ephesians 4:16 says that all the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself. The Body grows to build up the Body. A little boy builds himself up by growing. The feeding of the mother helps the growth of this boy, and his growth builds him up. Thus, the boy builds himself up by his growth. When his growth stops, there is no more building. This is an illustration of the organic building up of the church, which is a great lack among today&rsquo;s Christians. If there is no growth in life, there is no building up.</p><h2 class="head2">Through the Members of the Body<br />
Growing into Christ, the Head,<br />
in All Things</h2>
<p>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is the growth of the Body through the members of the Body growing into Christ, the Head, in all things (Eph. 4:15-16). The growth in life is the organic building, and the growth in life is our getting into Christ more and more. Many of the young people love the Lord, but in many things they are still outside of the Lord. A person may not be in Christ in the way that he cuts his hair. A brother who has long hair and a beard like a &ldquo;hippie&rdquo; may love the Lord, but in the way that he keeps his hair and his beard, he is not in Christ. Thus, he needs to grow, and to grow is to have Christ increase in him. When Christ increases in him, he will keep his hair short (1 Cor. 11:14).</p>
<p>Many sisters may have grown into Christ in many things, but in the matter of the way that they comb their hair, they have not grown into Christ. Some sisters may say that they have very little time to read the Bible, but they may spend much time in front of a mirror combing their hair. We may tell the Lord that we love Him, but when we comb our hair we forget about Him. Why would we not spend more time to pray in the morning and less time to comb and style our hair?</p>
<p>We also need to grow up into Christ in the way that we dress. Once when I was in Texas, I met a very good, seeking brother who loved the Lord, but I noticed that he was wearing cowboy boots. Deep within I realized that at least in the matter of wearing shoes, he was not in Christ. I still remember a period of time when the ties that men wore became wider and wider. While the style of ties was becoming wider, I still wore a narrow tie. I realized that if my tie increased, Christ would be reduced. At one time I saw a brother wearing wide ties in an outward display. Eventually, I noticed that the ties he wore became narrower. The ties that he wore became narrower by Christ increasing within him. In everything a brother may be in Christ, but when he wears a wide tie, he is not in Christ in that matter. He may only wear ties according to the course of this present age. This means that he does not give room to Christ in his wearing of ties. After a time, he may become clear within that Christ is not pleased with the ties that he wears. In his prayer he repents to the Lord, asking the Lord for forgiveness. He confesses that he did not give the Lord any room within him in the matter of wearing ties. He opens to the Lord to give Him all the room in this practical matter. As a result, this brother receives more of Christ. He is filled up with the Spirit of Christ, the very essence of Christ, and he grows up into Christ.</p>
<p>We need to grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things. Christ is the Head. He is the authority, the &ldquo;Boss.&rdquo; Whatever He says&mdash;that&rsquo;s it. We should not live according to our way and our opinion. We must take Him as our Head. The organic building up of the Body of Christ is the increase of God in Christ as the Spirit within us. This increase is our getting into Christ gradually in all things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Out from Christ, the Head,<br />
All the Body Causing<br />
the Growth of the Body<br />
unto the Building Up of Itself</h2>
<p>Out from Christ, the Head, all the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of the Body itself (Eph. 4:16). The growth of the Body depends upon every member growing. In other words, the growth of the Body depends upon all the members having the increase of God to get themselves more and more into Christ in all things. The growth of the Body is the totality of the growth of every member. This growth of the Body is unto the building up of the Body itself. The organic building is the increase of the Triune God in each one of us. In this organic building, there is absolutely no element of organization.</p>
<p>We have spent a great amount of time studying Ephesians 4:16, and we feel that the following translation of this verse is the best: &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, joined closely together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; This verse shows us the two categories of members of the Body of Christ: the joints of the rich supply and each one part. This matches the thought in verses 11 and 12 which tell us that Christ as the Head gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints. The two categories of members in these verses are the gifted persons (the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers) and the saints. The gifted persons are the joints of the rich supply, and the saints are the parts, the members, of the Body of Christ. The Body causes itself to grow through every joint of the rich supply. The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are the joints of the rich supply in the Body. Each one part refers to all the saints who are perfected by these gifts. Thus, in verse 11 are the joints of the rich supply, and in verse 12 is each one part.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:16 tells us that out from Christ, the Head, all the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of the Body itself. The subject is &ldquo;all the Body&rdquo; and the predicate is &ldquo;causes.&rdquo; In between the subject and the predicate is a long insertion. This insertion tells us that the Body is joined closely together through every joint of the rich supply and knit together through the operation in measure of each one part. Because of this, the Body causes itself to grow. The members of the Body are joined closely together by the joints and knit together by each one part. In a physical building of stones, there is also the joining and the knitting. The frames of the building need to be joined closely together, and the stones of the building are put together by being interwoven. This interweaving is the knitting together of the stones. Thus, two categories of materials are used in a physical building. One is the frames, and the other is the parts or materials to fill up the openings between the frames. In the Body of Christ, the joints are like the frames of a physical building. These joints should be joined closely together.</p>
<p>The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are the joints of the Body of Christ with the rich supply. When the joints of our physical body are exercised, the blood circulates throughout our entire body to supply our body. To make our body strong, we need to exercise our joints. Exercise makes us healthy because it brings in more of the blood supply. Our physical body illustrates, or portrays, the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:4-5). We have a circulation in our physical body, and Christ&rsquo;s Body also has a circulation. This circulation is the very fellowship of the Spirit. In the Body of Christ, the joints of the rich supply have to be exercised to promote the circulation, the fellowship, of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Body also needs to be knit together through the operation in measure of each one part. Some among us are joints of the rich supply, and some are parts operating in their own measure. When the joints and the parts are functioning, the Body is being built up organically.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:1-5; Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:16; John 3:3, 5; 1 Cor. 4:15; 1 Pet. 2:2; Heb. 6:5; 5:13-14; Eph. 4:11-14</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we saw that the Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God, not an organization of human beings. We also saw that the organic building up of the Body of Christ is the increase of the Triune God in the believers for their growth in Christ. In this chapter we want to see more concerning this organic building up. For the organic building up of the Body of Christ, we need to serve in an organic way by ministering Christ to others. Furthermore, the Body of Christ is built up organically through the members of the Body feeding on the milk and food of the holy Word and through the saints being perfected by the gifts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MINISTERING CHRIST TO OTHERS FOR<br />
THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>To build up the Body of Christ, the church of God, is to minister Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, essentially to people for their growth into Christ. Christ in His essence is Spirit, and we must be filled up with this Spirit, the very essence of Christ. When we are filled up with this essence, we are full of Christ. We have to exercise our spirit where this essential Christ is. This essential Christ is in our spirit. Exercising our spirit is like the exercise of our joints in our physical body. When we exercise our joints, this promotes the circulation of the blood in our body. When we exercise our spirit, Christ as the very spiritual, divine essence circulates within us. When we speak with the exercise of our spirit, we minister Christ into people. When people listen to us by exercising their spirit, they receive the essence of Christ into their being. Our ministering of Christ into others causes the increase of the essence of Christ within them for their growth in Christ. The increase of the essence of Christ within the saints of a local church is the growth of this local church, and this is also the organic building up of this local church.</p>
<p>I would like to illustrate the difference between the inorganic and the organic way of serving. Let us say that there is a brother who has a problem with an elder. The inorganic way to talk to this brother is to act as a middleman to negotiate with him and advise him. We might say, &ldquo;The church should have elders. Without the elders, the church would be a mess. Furthermore, every one of us is human and no human is perfect. If we put a demand on a brother that he should be perfect, this demand is impossible to fulfill. Even the Apostle Paul was not perfect. The only perfect human being is the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; This fellowship sounds very good, but it is inorganic. Seemingly, I may do a marvelous job at bringing the two parties together in peace, but I may do this apart from life.</p>
<p>If I know the organic way of service, I would talk to this brother differently. I would say, &ldquo;Brother, we all have Christ living within us. We should not live by ourselves. Even more, we should not live by our flesh. We should live by Christ as our life, and He is in our spirit. We have to walk according to Him.&rdquo; In my talk with this brother, I may not even touch the problem that he has with the elder. My speaking to him will minister life to him. When he receives my word and brings this word to God, the Lord will have the room in him, the place in him, to move and to operate. This will change his entire being, including his attitude and his relationship with the elder. Thus, his problem with this elder will be solved organically. Both the brother and the elder will grow in Christ. This growth is the increase of God in them and the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We need to consider this fellowship and pray over it. I hope that in the church life we will only have the organic way to help the saints to grow. We should not use any inorganic way, even if it is the best way. The inorganic way is to arrange and to organize, but that does not issue in the growth of the Body of Christ. We always have to learn how to exercise our spirit to follow the indwelling Christ. Then God will increase in us more and more, and we will grow in God&rsquo;s increase. Then the church will be built up organically.</p>
<p>If we go out to teach others in a doctrinal way, they will only get a lot of biblical knowledge. They will grow in the knowledge of the Bible but not in the essence of Christ. Their objective knowledge concerning Christ may be increased, but the essence of Christ Himself within them will not increase. To merely teach ethics and not to minister Christ is the sickness and the deficiency of today&rsquo;s Christian work.</p>
<p>The ethical teachers of Confucius in China taught the Chinese to grow in their knowledge of morality. When I was young, I heard Christians say that the Bible teaches the same ethics as Confucius&rsquo; teaching. Confucius teaches that wives should submit themselves to their husbands and that the children should honor their parents, and the Bible teaches the same thing. The Chinese were taught to honor their parents for thousands of years. According to my thinking, there was no need for the missionaries to come to China to teach us what we already knew. Both the people in the West and in the East have been governed by this kind of ethical teaching. Actually, this ethical teaching is not the proper Christian teaching. The proper Christian teaching ministers Christ not only in knowledge but also as people&rsquo;s life and life supply. Christian teaching ministers Christ into people essentially to cause people to gain more and more of Christ every day.</p>
<p>For the organic building up of the Body of Christ, the elders need to shepherd all the dear saints who have problems. In my ministry when I was young, many couples came to me with marriage problems. In my fellowship with them, I frequently gave them principles that govern the proper marriage life. When they tried to put these principles into practice, however, they did not work. Later, I became very ill with tuberculosis. In my sickness, the Lord showed me that the work that I had been doing was in vain because the teaching that I gave the saints was in the sphere of ethical teaching. I opened up to the Lord for Him to show me what was wrong with my service. According to my concept, the Word merely told us that the husband should love the wife and the wife should submit herself to the husband. I tried to teach the married saints principles in this realm. The Lord showed me instead that I needed to help all the saints by nourishing them with Christ. I had to learn how to minister Christ to them.</p>
<p>After the Lord showed me this, I dealt with the saints in a different way when they came to me with their problems. I helped them to realize that Christ is our life and our life supply and that we have to feed on Him, enjoy Him, and be nourished with Him. Then I asked the saints to pray with me. In this way I helped them to receive the life supply. This was similar to adding fertilizer and water to a tree. This life supply helps the saints to grow. In their growth they build themselves up in their Christian life, and this building up overcomes all their problems.</p>
<p>Much of the Christian work today is ethical. Some Christian workers are deep in philosophy and logic, so their teaching is philosophical. Too many Christian teachers are teaching people ethically. They may not know much about Confucius, but actually they are doing work in the principle of Confucius. Very little of Christ is ministered. Paul said in Romans 15:16 that he was a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations. A minister of Christ Jesus is one who serves people with Christ. He ministers Christ into others. The ministry is not a matter of ethical and philosophical teachings.</p>
<p>I have shared much concerning the home meetings and the group meetings, but according to my observation, it is difficult for me to see the saints practicing these meetings according to the nature of my teaching. We mostly take care of the home meetings and the group meetings in a natural way, not in the way of ministering Christ to serve the saints with Christ Himself as the life supply. A Christian worker should minister Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit into the saints to be their life supply. He must help the saints learn to enjoy the Lord and be nourished by the Lord so that they can grow. This is the way to build up the believers, and this will build up the church. If we minister Christ to the saints, the saints in our locality will grow to build themselves up, and the totality of their being built up will be the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>This realization of ministering Christ to others revolutionizes our work. It changes the very nature and essence of our work. After I received this realization of ministering Christ to others according to the principle of the tree of life, I learned to deal with the saints&rsquo; problems in an organic way. When they came to me with their marriage problems, I would fellowship with them in this way: &ldquo;We all realize we have Christ in us. We also know that our old man, whether good or bad, was crucified with Christ. When we are living with our spouse, are we living by ourselves, or are we living by Christ? Do we deal with our spouse under the cross?&rdquo; In this kind of fellowship, I brought them into the living of Christ&rsquo;s life under His cross. This fellowship is organic because it helps people to get themselves more into Christ, especially in the matter of living together with one another. Before I learned this lesson, I may have helped certain couples, but I did not help them get themselves into Christ in their living with one another. They may have changed their behavior, but they were still in themselves. They were not in Christ in living with one another. Once I fully learned the lesson of ministering according to the tree of life, my fellowship with them would bring them into Christ in the matter of dealing with one another.</p>
<p>We must grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things so that the Body of Christ can be built up organically. There is only one unique way that can build us up to face any kind of situation. This way is to get ourselves, in all things, into Christ under the cross. This is the organic way. To build up the church organically is to live Christ under the cross. In many things we have to learn one thing&mdash;to live Christ under the cross. Then in all things we are crossed out, and it is not us but Christ who lives in us. As long as we live Christ under the cross with anyone and in anything, we are getting ourselves gradually in everything into Christ. By this way, we take Christ as the Head, and we annul ourselves in our headship. A brother who is quarreling with his wife may say, &ldquo;Please tell me&mdash;who is the head? You or me?&rdquo; If the husband is growing up into Christ, the Head, in all things, he would not remind his wife that he is the head and that she should be under him. When we live a life of getting ourselves more and more into Christ, the Head, we would say, &ldquo;Lord, I am not the head. You are the Head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The organic building is to live Christ under the cross. To live according to Galatians 2:20&mdash;&ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me&rdquo;&mdash;is organic. The building up of the Body of Christ is in such an organic condition and situation. Today it is difficult to see saints living in such a way. There are many Christians who have never heard messages concerning living Christ under the cross. We should not blame them, but we have heard many messages on living Christ. Where is the living of Christ under the cross in our daily life? In the real situations of our daily life, do we live Christ? Where is the fact of the living of Christ among us? It may be that we mostly have only the doctrine of living Christ, not the reality. The organic building up of the Body of Christ takes place when some take the lead to live Christ under the cross. When we have the reality of living Christ under the cross in our living as our spiritual fact, the saints will receive the help from us when we teach them. When we all live Christ under the cross, spontaneously the increase of God is among us. This increase of God is the growth of the Body, and this growth is the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We need to be people filled with the essence of Christ Himself. It is not enough for us merely to have the knowledge concerning Christ. We need more of the person of Christ essentially. The increase of the Triune God within the believers is the growth of the Body of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. This growth, this increase, is the organic building up of the Body of Christ. In the past we did not experience very much of the organic building up of the Body of Christ. We need to have Christ growing in us day by day. We should not exercise ourselves in ethics. Day by day we need to exercise our spirit consciously, purposely, and intentionally to receive Christ essentially more and more. We need to have Christ added to us and increasing in us day by day.</p>
 <p>The last verse of <em>Hymns,</em> #203 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">We&rsquo;re Thy total reproduction,<br />
Thy dear Body and Thy Bride,<br />
Thine expression and Thy fullness,<br />
For Thee ever to abide.<br />
We are Thy continuation,<br />
Thy life-increase and Thy spread,<br />
Thy full growth and Thy rich surplus,<br />
One with Thee, our glorious Head.</p>
<p>I wrote this hymn soon after I came to the United States over twenty-five years ago. This indicates that the light concerning the growth of the Body came to us years ago. We may have many books of the ministry on our bookshelves, but I wonder how much of Christ we actually have in the practical church life. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, ethics may be more prevailing among us than Christ. Unconsciously, we may be living ethics and not living Christ. The organic building up of the Body of Christ is a crucial &ldquo;missing&rdquo; among us. This is why there is the need of the Lord&rsquo;s advance in His recovery today. I hope that after reading this fellowship, we will purposely abandon ethics and take Christ. We should not care for ethics. We should only care for Christ. When we live Christ, we have the highest ethics. Christ Himself is the highest ethics in the entire universe. He is the highest peak of all the mountains of ethics. We should not live by ethics, but live Christ.</p>
<p>We should not exercise our knowledge to consider how to be ethical and moral. Let us forget about that. Every day, beginning in the morning, we need to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord by calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; We need to tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You.&rdquo; I read something many years ago about John Nelson Darby that touched me deeply. He was over eighty years old, and he was staying in a hotel alone. He knelt down beside his bed and said, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I still love You.&rdquo; This story impressed me to the uttermost. After his many years of experiencing Christ, he would say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I still love You.&rdquo; When we rise up in the morning, we should say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You. Lord, especially today, I like to love You more than ever.&rdquo; When we say this, our whole being will rise up, not with ethics but with Christ. When I minister to the saints in this way, I build up the churches organically. Such an organic ministry carries on the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THROUGH THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY<br />
FEEDING ON THE MILK AND FOOD<br />
OF THE HOLY WORD AS THE EMBODIMENT<br />
OF CHRIST AS THE LIVING WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>The organic building up of the Body of Christ, the increase of the Triune God in the believers for their growth in Christ, is through the members of the Body feeding on the milk and food of the holy Word as the embodiment of Christ as the living Word of God. In order for the Body of Christ to be built up organically, we need to feed on the milk and food of the holy Word. We cannot exercise and function physically unless we feed on something. Whenever we eat, we are strengthened. Likewise, whenever we take in the milk and food of the holy Word, we are strengthened to live Christ. The holy Word is the embodiment of Christ, and the embodiment of Christ is the living Word of God. In other words, the living Word is embodied in the written Word.</p>
<p>According to the Word of God, to be saved is to be reborn, which means that this is an organic matter (John 3:3, 5; 1 Cor. 4:15). People being saved organically is the beginning of the building up of the Body of Christ. After I was saved, I loved the Lord, and I tried to preach the gospel. At that time no one had perfected me to preach the gospel. Thus, I preached the gospel inorganically. I did not know what it was to impart the divine life into people. Inorganic preaching is preaching without the dispensing, the imparting, of life.</p>
<p>The Spirit and life are synonyms. Without the Spirit, there is no life. Life is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is life. God, who is the Spirit and life, is in our spirit. Now we must exercise our spirit. When we exercise our spirit, life comes out. When we go to visit sinners, we must pray much so that our spirit is stirred up. When our spirit is stirred up and exercised, we will be able to impart Christ into others. We need to tell the unbelievers that the very Savior, Jesus Christ, is the life-giving Spirit and that they can exercise their spirit to call on Him. We can call on the Lord, and we can ask them to repeat what we say. When they call on the Lord, they will touch the Spirit. This kind of preaching is the imparting of Christ as life into someone. We need to preach the gospel in this life-imparting, organic way to make people children of God and members of Christ.</p>
<p>These reborn people are newborn babes in Christ. As newborn babes, they need to long for the milk of the word (the good word of God&mdash;Heb. 6:5) that they may grow (1 Pet. 2:2). Then as mature ones they need to take the solid food of the word, the word of righteousness (Heb. 5:13-14). The book of Hebrews shows us two categories of God&rsquo;s word: one is the good word of God, and the other is the word of righteousness. The good word of God is not that deep. It is the milk to nourish the babes. The word of righteousness is deep, and it is the solid food for the mature ones so that they may be full-grown.</p>
<p>After a new one gets saved, we need to go back to him continually to feed him. Peter said in 1 Peter 2:2 that the newborn babes should long for the milk of the word. A newborn babe cannot feed himself. There must be a nursing mother to feed him. After we baptize people, we immediately need to feed them with the good word of God in the Bible. We can tell them that God is love. This is a good word. We should not, however, tell them that God is just and that He will punish us if we are not faithful to Him. We should not tell the new ones that God is righteous and that as Christians we may be either rewarded or disciplined and punished for one thousand years. Sharing this with the new ones is like trying to feed the infants with hard German bread. We should not feed the new ones with solid food. We should always feed them with the milk of the word, the good word of God. We can tell them that God loves them and sympathizes with them. We can also tell them that whatever happens to them is under God&rsquo;s control. This is to give the little infants some milk.</p>
<p>To feed the young ones we should use the good word of God until they grow up. Then they will be able to take solid food. To feed the believers either with milk or with solid food is organic. By this organic way we raise up the young ones, and to raise up the young ones is to build them up. When mothers feed their children, they are building up their children. The real building up of the children is their growth. The growth of a child is the increase of its human life. The church is of the divine life, so the building up of the church has to be organic.</p>
<p>To build up the church organically, we have to feed others with the organic Word, with Christ. Christ is surely organic because He is the life-giving Spirit. Christ is God, God is life, and God is organic. We should always feed the believers with organic matters, that is, with God, Christ, the Spirit, life, or the word of life from the Bible. The more we feed others, the more God increases in them. This increase of God within the believers is their growth, and the totality of the growth of the believers is the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>When the believers are being fed, they are growing. This means that God is increasing within them. New ones have God within them, but they do not have much of God. We need to visit them again and again to feed them. After two months of this kind of feeding, these new ones will have much more of God. God will have increased within them, and they will grow in life.</p>
<p>The organic building up is the growth in life, and this growth, in principle, always comes from nourishing. If a person does not eat, how can he grow? The New Testament shows us that we, the growing Christians, have two kinds of groceries, milk and solid food. Paul told the Hebrews that he could only minister the milk to them and not the solid food (5:12). Most Christians today only know something concerning the good word of God, the milk of the word. This is the word of life, the word of grace, and the word of mercy. Another category of the holy Word, the word of righteousness, is the word concerning God&rsquo;s governmental dealings and concerning His dispensational reward and punishment.</p>
<p>We may like to receive the truth of John 3:16, but do we like the truth in Matthew 25? In this chapter we are told that the Lord&rsquo;s slothful and evil slaves will be cast into outer darkness (vv. 26, 30). The word of God in Matthew 25 is the word of righteousness. Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5 that we must fear the Lord because one day we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ to be judged by Him according to our Christian work, life, and behavior (vv. 10-11). We will be judged by the Lord according to what we have been, what we have done, and how we have worked after our salvation. We have to give an account to our dear Lord. He will judge us. He will either reward us or punish us. He could say, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave...enter into the joy of your lord&rdquo; (Matt. 25:21), or He could call us an &ldquo;evil and slothful slave&rdquo; (v. 26) and cast us out into the outer darkness (v. 30).</p>
<p>The book of Hebrews warns us with the type of the children of Israel. Approximately two million Israelites enjoyed the Passover and crossed the Red Sea to come out of Egypt. They were saved out of the Egyptian tyranny. In the wilderness they enjoyed the heavenly manna and the water out of the cleft rock. However, Paul tells us in Hebrews 3 that the Lord was disgusted with them and that their carcasses fell in the wilderness (v. 17). Only two of them, Joshua and Caleb, were exceptions. Paul warned us with this example of the children of Israel (1 Cor. 10:5-13). He said that we need to beware since we could fall down in the wilderness. This means that there is the possibility for us Christians to come short of entering into Christ as our good land. This is the word of righteousness.</p>
<p>The babes who can only take in the milk and not the solid food are inexperienced in the word of righteousness (Heb. 5:13). The word of righteousness is a word concerning God being just. God is not only loving, but He is also exercising His justice all the time. Therefore, we must have some holy fear toward Him. Every day we should come to His throne of grace to receive mercy and grace (Heb. 4:16), but the day will come when this throne of grace will become a throne of judgment (2 Cor. 5:10). We who have been receiving mercy and grace at the throne of grace for years will eventually be judged at the judgment seat of Christ. The Hebrews needed this word of righteousness.</p>
<p>For us to grow we need either the good word of God as milk to nourish us or the word of righteousness as solid food. We need the holy Word in order to grow in Christ. The two greatest items in this universe are the Triune God and the holy Bible. The Triune God, the holy person, is within us, and the holy Word is in our hand. We all have to grow by being nourished by the word of the Holy Bible, either the good word of God or the word of righteousness. By feeding on the milk and food of the holy Word, we grow and this growth is the very organic building up of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THROUGH THE SAINTS BEING PERFECTED (EQUIPPED) BY THE GIFTS (THE GIFTED PERSONS)</h2>
<p>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is also through the saints being perfected, equipped, by the gifts, the gifted persons (Eph. 4:11-12). If we are being perfected by the gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers&mdash;we will grow. Through our growth we will arrive at three things: at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a fullgrown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13). To arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God is to arrive at the oneness of truth and of life.</p>
<p>Apparently we are one, but actually there are many different views, opinions, and ideas among us. When the church life is so peaceful, it seems that everything is okay. But when a storm comes into the churches, all the opinions come out. The saints may even begin to fight for their views, ideas, and opinions. This is strong proof that we are still babyish and that we need the growth in life. All these different views, ideas, and opinions are &ldquo;toys&rdquo; for children. An older person does not need toys, but young children will fight over toys. The younger you are, the more toys you will like. We may be peaceful in the churches, but when a storm comes, one saint will have his toy, and another saint will have another toy. These toys are the different ideas, views, and opinions. Therefore, we all need to grow. When young children are fighting for toys, they make a lot of noise. There is also a lot of &ldquo;noise&rdquo; in the churches when the saints are fighting and disputing over their views, opinions, and ideas. The more we grow, the more toys we will drop. Then we will arrive at the oneness of the faith, which is concerning the truth, and at the full knowledge of the Son of God, which is concerning life. If we are mature in truth and in life, there will be no problems.</p>
<p>We also need to arrive at a full-grown man. We may be mature, but not full-grown. All of us need the growth in the divine life to arrive at a full-grown man. Finally, we need to arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Christ has a fullness, and this fullness is His Body. This Body has a stature, and this stature has a measure. The church as the Body of Christ has a stature, but this stature may be very short, so the measure is not that high. Therefore, the church has to grow. That means the church has to be organically built up, and this organic building up will result in our arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, which is His Body.</p>
<p>Christ is the One who fills all in all. He is the unlimited One, and His measurements are the measurements of the universe. He is the real length, the real breadth, the real height, and the real depth (Eph. 3:18). Can anyone tell how long, how broad, how high, or how deep the universe is? It is immeasurable. Christ&rsquo;s measurements are the measurements of the entire universe. How can we know such a One in full? This is why the Lord said that no one can know the Son unless the Father reveals Him to them (Matt. 16:17). The Son is unlimited and immeasurable.</p>
<p>The fullness of Christ is the expression of Christ. When a cup is only half filled with water, we cannot see the expression of the water. But when the cup is filled with water to such an extent that it overflows with water, this overflow of water is the fullness of the water, the expression of the water. The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is the measure of the stature of the expression of Christ, the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Christ has two kinds of bodies. One is His physical body, the body which was crucified on the cross. His physical body was limited. When the Lord Jesus set up His table, He told the disciples to eat the bread, and He said that this was His body which He gave for us (Luke 22:19). The bread of the Lord&rsquo;s table is a symbol signifying the Lord&rsquo;s body broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it. There is also the mystical Body of Christ. Romans 12:5 says that though we are many, we are one Body in Christ. This is not the Lord&rsquo;s physical body, but the mystical Body of Christ. All the genuine believers are members of the mystical Body of Christ. This mystical, unlimited Body expresses the One who fills all in all.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1 reveals that whatever Christ is and has attained is to the church. This is a kind of transmission or infusion. Then Ephesians 1 tells us that the church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (vv. 22-23). Thus, the mystical Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ. The immeasurable, unlimited fullness is the expression of the One that fills all in all. The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is the measure of the stature of the mystical Body of Christ. We need to arrive at the measure of the stature of the unlimited fullness of Christ, of the mystical Body of Christ, who is the One who fills all in all.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:14 tells us that by arriving at these three things, we will &ldquo;be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; If we are still carried about by the winds of teaching, that is a sign that we are babes. All the winds of teaching are in the sleight of men. There are always lies and dishonest words in the different winds of teaching. These winds of teaching are in craftiness with a view to a system of error. In order to get a deeper explanation of Ephesians 4:14, it will be a help to read the notes in the Recovery Version on this verse. The system of error is the system of Satan.</p>
<p>The winds of teaching are apparently teachings according to the Bible. Actually, these teachings are in the satanic system of error to make divisions and to cause trouble. We have to be cautious concerning the winds of teaching, but only to be cautious is not adequate. As we pointed out, younger children like to play with toys. An older person, on the other hand, does not care for toys regardless of how much you encourage him to play with them. A person who is mature in life will not like any wind of teaching, because he does not care for toys. We need to grow in life so that we will no longer be babes who can be carried about by every wind of teaching. The perfecting of the saints by the gifts issues in their growth in life, and this growth in life is the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS<br />
BY THE GIFTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-12; 2 Tim. 2:2; 1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17; 1 Pet. 5:1-3</h1>
<p>In chapters three and four, we saw that the Lord desires to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ. The building up of the Body must be organic. It is altogether a matter of life. Without life, there is no genuine building up of the church. There is very little of the element of life in today&rsquo;s Christianity. What we see built up among most of today&rsquo;s Christians is mostly inorganic. According to the New Testament, however, the building up of the church should be altogether in life.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is like our physical body. In our physical body, no part is lifeless. If a person has false teeth, these false teeth are artificial and inorganic. We may say that they are parts of a person&rsquo;s body, yet they have nothing to do with the person&rsquo;s life. They have nothing to do with the blood circulation of a person&rsquo;s body. The circulation of blood within our body must reach every member of our body. If the circulation of our blood is cut off from a certain part of our body, that part will begin to die. The circulation of blood is the circulation of life. In order for the Body of Christ to be built up, there is the need for the circulation of life and the growth in life.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4 tells us clearly how the Body of Christ is built up. Paul pointed out in Ephesians 4 that Christ, the ascended Head, in His ascension gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. When we Christians read the Bible, we have a tendency to take everything for granted. We need to get into the depths of the truth revealed in Ephesians 4:11-16. Not many Christians understand these six verses. What does it mean to perfect the saints? What is the work of the ministry, and what is it to build up the Body of Christ? Ephesians 4:11-16 is a portion of the Word that has been missed by most Christians. This portion of the Word has to be recovered, and I believe that today is the right time and that we are the right people for the Lord to carry out such a recovery. We must cooperate with the Lord for the advance of His recovery today.</p>
<p>We need to enter into the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s thought when he talked about the perfecting of the saints. The thought of his word concerning the perfecting of the saints is that God&rsquo;s intention is to have every believer able to do the things that the gifted persons do. Every believer should be able to do the work of the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. The thought in today&rsquo;s Christianity, however, is different from this. A certain group of people is a clerical class. They are the ones who do the holy service; whereas the rest of the believers are the laity. This kind of philosophy and practice annuls the spiritual, organic function of all the believers.</p>
<p>There is a capacity in the divine life which the believers possess and enjoy, and this capacity needs to be developed unto their ability. In the human life there is the capacity of hearing, seeing, smelling, speaking, and walking. All these capacities need a certain amount of development, and for the development to take place there is the need of practice. A little infant has the capacity to see, but if his eyes are always covered, he will become blind because his seeing function has never been practiced or developed. To cover the infant&rsquo;s eyes is to annul the seeing function. For the function to be developed, there is the need for the growth of life and practice. An infant learns to speak by practicing and by the growth of life.</p>
<p>The traditional practice of Christianity annuls the capacity in the divine life that the believers possess and enjoy. The practice of Christianity with one pastor speaking to many believers week after week annuls their spiritual ability and function. Hundreds of Christians may sit in a pew and listen to sermons for many years without learning how to pray. When there is the need of prayer, they will go to their pastor.</p>
<p>The practice of Christianity also robs the believers of the opportunities to function. If a person gets saved and sits in a pew for a year, he will not learn how to function. Mostly he will learn how to sit passively and listen to a choir sing and a pastor preach. Even listening to a choir annuls the singing ability of the saints. The truth concerning the perfecting of the saints is the opposite of the practice of traditional Christianity. The Apostle Paul&rsquo;s way was to perfect the saints in everything. Ephesians 4:11-12 shows us that for the building up of the Body of Christ, the saints need to be perfected by the gifted persons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRODUCING OF THE GIFTS</h2>
<p>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is carried out by the living, organic perfecting of the saints by the gifts. In order to accomplish His desire to build up the church, Christ went through a marvelous process. He passed through incarnation, human living, an all-inclusive death on the cross, and resurrection. After His resurrection, Christ ascended to the height, the highest place in the universe, the third heaven (Eph. 4:8). The distance from the earth to the moon is very small compared with the universal system that Christ passed through to ascend to the height. In His ascension, Christ became the One above all, and He received the headship over all things.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:8 tells us that in Christ&rsquo;s ascension, &ldquo;He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.&rdquo; The redeemed saints were taken captive by Satan before they were saved by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. In His ascension, Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan&rsquo;s captivity and took them to Himself. After conquering and rescuing them from Satan and death through His death and resurrection, Christ in His ascension made the rescued sinners gifts with His resurrection life. These gifts were constituted and formed through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, all-inclusive death, resurrection, and ascension. In His ascension, the formation and the constitution of the gifts was completed.</p>
<p>These believers as completed gifts are the possessions of God the Father. Ephesians 1 says that Christ&rsquo;s redeeming blood made us the inheritance of God (v. 11). When Christ ascended to the heavens, He completed His constituting work to make us all God&rsquo;s inheritance. In His ascension, after He completed such a constitution of all the believers as God the Father&rsquo;s inheritance, God the Father gave all of us as an inheritance to His Son, Christ. The Father gave us as gifts to the Son, and the Son gave these gifts to the church, His Body, for its building up. Every believer is a gift given by the Father to His Son. In the book of John, we are told that all the believers were given by the Father to the Son as gifts (17:2, 6, 9, 24; 6:37, 39; cf. Psa. 68:18).</p>
<p>As the inheritance of God the Father, we were sealed by His Spirit to indicate that we belong to God (Eph. 1:13). Ephesians 1 also tells us that God is the pledge of our inheritance (v. 14). The sealing Spirit becomes a pledge in us, guaranteeing us that God is our inheritance. Therefore, we are God&rsquo;s inheritance, and God is our inheritance. Our unique inheritance is our God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GIFTS BEING THE GIFTED PERSONS</h2>
<p>The gifts in Ephesians 4:8 are the gifted persons listed in verse 11. Ephesians 4:11-12 says, &ldquo;And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; In these verses we see the perfecting of the saints by the gifts. The gifts are the gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. These persons are the particular gifts, the top gifts, that the Lord Jesus as the ascended Head in His ascension gave to His Body for the building up of His Body. We need to realize, however, that these dear ones, these gifts, do not build up the Body of Christ directly. They perfect the saints, and the saints do the direct building work. These particular gifts are relatively small in number. If they are the only ones working and serving, they surely will become a clergy. Furthermore, this clergy will spontaneously become a hierarchy. These gifted persons, who are small in number, should perfect all the common saints.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 4 every believer, every common saint, should be perfected. This is just like saying that all American citizens should be educated. The educational system in the United States has the goal of training, or perfecting, the American citizens. At least, all Americans are encouraged to graduate from high school. As a result, many Americans are able to read, write, and be active, functioning, and productive members of society. Suppose that in the United States only a very small number of gifted persons were allowed to be educated. If this were the case, the United States would be in a poor situation. Just as people in society should be educated, trained, and perfected, we believers also need to be perfected to function in the Body of Christ. Perfecting implies teaching, instructing, and educating.</p>
<p>All the believers in Christ need to be perfected by the gifted persons so that they can do the work of the gifted persons. This is revealed in the Bible, but it is not practiced today in Christianity. The practice of Christianity is to educate only a small number to be the gifted persons, and these gifted persons become a class of clergy. This clergy spontaneously becomes a hierarchy while the rest of the common Christians become the laity. Today in Christianity there is the clergy-laity system.</p>
<p>Some denominations refer to some of their members as &ldquo;lay preachers.&rdquo; This is altogether unscriptural. It is poor to refer to a believer in this way. This terminology should be abandoned. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we should have neither the clergy nor the laity. We should not have professional preachers nor lay preachers. All of the common saints should be equipped and enabled to do the work of the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. This is not my teaching, but Paul&rsquo;s teaching, the Bible&rsquo;s teaching.</p>
<p>The Lord gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints unto, resulting in, the work of the ministry. The work of the ministry is the work of the priests of the gospel of God (Rom. 15:16). According to the grammatical construction of Ephesians 4:12, &ldquo;unto the building up of the Body of Christ&rdquo; is in apposition with &ldquo;unto the work of ministry.&rdquo; Therefore, the building up of the Body of Christ is the work of the New Testament ministry, and this ministry is the gospelizing of the New Testament priests. Even our preaching of the gospel is a part of the building up of the Body of Christ organically.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Apostles</h2>
<p>The apostles preach the gospel, establish the churches, and give the definition of the truths. An apostle should at least do these three things. Furthermore, an apostle also perfects others to do what he does. We need those who can establish the churches. If four families migrate to a new city, they may wonder how they can set up the church in that city. This question can be asked because we did not practice adequately the perfecting of the saints. The saints need to be perfected to do the work of the apostles. The ones among us who are apostles, need to perfect the saints year-round. If we are perfected adequately by the apostles, we will know how to establish the churches. When we migrate to a new place with some other families, we will know how to set up a church.</p>
<p>The practice of the perfecting of the saints by the gifts is absolutely different from the practice of Christianity. In Christianity, they ask people to devote themselves, and they send these people to seminaries to study and learn the Bible. After their graduation, they become pastors who have been instructed to establish churches in an organizational way. One person told us that our way of spreading the gospel was the best. Within twenty years, we spread the gospel to all six continents, yet we did not have formal missionaries or a mission board. We did not have any formal fund raising. In spite of this, churches have been set up. These churches were set up by some saints who had been perfected. This shows us the great need for the perfecting of the saints by the gifts. I feel that Southern California is very good for the church life because there are so many small cities there. In every small city, there is the need of a lampstand. In principle, we should not always stay in one city. After seven years, we can move from one city to the next city to establish a church there.</p>
<p>In addition to preaching the gospel and establishing the churches, an apostle should be able to give the definition of the truths. He should know the difference between truths such as justification and reconciliation. If we do not know how to give the proper definition of the truths, we are not qualified to set up a church. This is because when a church is set up, there are many questions concerning the divine truths.</p>
<p>We need to ask the Lord to make us willing and ready to be perfected. We need to be taught the truths concerning the incarnation of Christ and the all-inclusive death of Christ. We need to be taught concerning the forgiveness of sins, the cleansing of sins, justification, and reconciliation. We need to be taught concerning regeneration, sanctification, metabolic transformation, conformation to the image of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, and glorification, the redemption of our body. We need to know the truth concerning the renewing of the mind so that our soul can be transformed. We need to know the truth concerning the Triune God. What does it mean to say that God is triune? What is the divine Trinity? We must be able to explain the relationship between the Father and the Son. Why do we only have one God but three persons? If we cannot give the definitions of these truths, we are not fully qualified to set up the churches. We have many things to learn. We need to be perfected. I believe that after six months of being under a proper training, many of the saints will be able to define the truths.</p>
<p>I expect to see that the practice of the church life among us will be fully revolutionized. The church life is not merely a matter of attending corporate meetings week after week with no issue or result. In the past, the saints mostly heard general teachings concerning matters such as the cross, resurrection, and ascension. Many times the saints were stirred up, but to stir up the saints without their gaining something solid is meaningless. In Christianity they always like to pray for revivals, but revivals do not last that long. In the church practice, there must always be something solid imparted into the saints. When children go to school, they always gain something solid in knowledge year after year. Month after month the teachers render the students something solid. The teachers are not there merely to stir up the students who have a willing heart to study without giving them anything solid. If the teachers only stirred up the students, they could never be perfected. With the proper teaching, every lesson of the class imparts something solid.</p>
<p>We are short of this kind of perfecting in the churches. I know some saints who have been meeting with us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for close to forty years. They have been growing in the Lord, and they may be more spiritual, but they have not been perfected. If you ask them to share something concerning what it means to be sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified, they cannot do it. Even though they may have heard many messages on certain truths, they are not able to share these truths with others. They may even feel that it is not their job but the job of certain gifted brothers to know these truths and to share them with others. In the past we may have preached to the saints and taught them time after time, but there was very little issue from our teaching. The issue of our teaching must be the perfecting of the saints. After someone listens to me for five years, he should be able to do the same thing that I do. He should be able to preach the gospel, to set up the churches, and to define the truths.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul taught Timothy. He told him in 2 Timothy 2:15, &ldquo;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth.&rdquo; He told Timothy that he needed to learn to cut straight the word just as in carpentry. I am not a carpenter, so if someone asked me to cut a piece of wood properly, I could not do it. I would not cut the wood straight. Instead, I would cut it in a biased way. When a proper carpenter cuts wood, he cuts it straight. Paul told Timothy that he should learn to cut the word straight, that is, to define the truths rightly and straightly without distortion. Many preachers do not know how to define the truths properly. To them there is little difference between reconciliation and justification and between the forgiveness of sins and the washing of sins, but there are differences between these truths. Our sins may be forgiven, but we need the washing of our sins to wash away the stain of our sins. Forgiveness releases us and deals with the condemnation, and washing takes away the stain. To teach the truths rightly and straightly in such a way without distortion is to cut straight the word of the truth.</p>
<p>We all need to give ourselves to be perfected. We should not be Christians just in name but Christians in reality. Every Christian is a gift. The heavenly Head, Christ, constituted Paul the apostle a gift to the Body, and He made Paul an apostle directly. The Lord, however, constituted Timothy a gift to the church in a different way. One day under His sovereignty, He placed Timothy under Paul, and Paul taught Timothy and perfected him all the time. As a result, Timothy became an apostle, but he was not an apostle appointed by the Head directly. He was an apostle under the perfecting of the directly appointed apostle. This shows us that the gifted persons should bear the responsibility to perfect all the saints to do what they do.</p>
<p>Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:2, &ldquo;And the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&rdquo; The verb <em>perfect</em> is a synonym of the verb <em>teach.</em> Paul charged Timothy to commit what he had heard from him to the faithful ones, who would be competent to teach others. In other words, Paul perfected Timothy, and he charged him to teach others, which means to perfect them. Then these faithful ones would also teach others, perfect others. Paul perfected Timothy, Timothy perfected the faithful ones, and the faithful ones bore the burden to perfect the other saints. Eventually, the entire church would be perfected in this way.</p>
<p>Before this kind of perfecting work, one brother may have been the unique person who knew how to set up the churches, how to preach the gospel, and how to teach the truths. If a brother goes to a place to preach the gospel and to set up the churches, he must perfect some &ldquo;Timothys&rdquo; there. Then his &ldquo;Timothys&rdquo; will perfect some competent ones, and these competent ones will perfect the other believers. Eventually, all the believers there will be able to do what the gifted brother can do. Then instead of being the unique one among them who can preach the gospel, set up the churches, and give the definition of the truths, he becomes one among many who can do the same work. Therefore, there is no clergy and no laity. Because there is no clergy, there is not the possibility of building up a hierarchy. Instead, all the saints are enabled to preach the gospel, teach the truth, and set up churches.</p>
<p>We all have to be perfected to do the work of the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. The saints may feel that they cannot do this work, but this is why they need the perfecting. After being perfected, the saints can say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! I may not be an apostle, but I surely can do the same work that the Apostle Paul did.&rdquo; The apostles perfect all the common saints to do the same work that they do, but is this the situation today? We cannot see such a thing on this earth. Therefore, the perfecting of the saints by the gifts is a big &ldquo;missing.&rdquo; We need to praise the Lord that today He is recovering Ephesians 4:11-16. The Lord is speaking something that is altogether not seen on this earth.</p><h2 class="head2">The Prophets</h2>
<p>Now we need to go on to see the function of the prophets. The prophets speak for the Lord, speak forth the Lord, to dispense, impart, and minister Christ to others. To prophesy is not mainly to foretell or to predict as they do in the Pentecostal movement. In 1963 and 1964 some in the Pentecostal movement said that there would be a great earthquake and that the whole city of Los Angeles would fall into the ocean. These so-called prophecies were even published in major newspapers. Eventually, nothing happened. The prophets listed in Ephesians 4 and the prophecy that Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 14 are not like this. To prophesy is to speak for God, to speak forth God, and to speak God into others. According to 1 Corinthians 14:3, to prophesy is to speak building up, encouragement, and consolation. According to verses 24 and 25, when we prophesy, our speaking convicts others, judges others, and manifests the secrets of their heart. The practice of prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 has to be recovered. We all need to be perfected to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into others.</p>
<p>The prophets should bear the responsibility to perfect all the saints to do the work of a prophet. This is the biblical way, but this is not the common practice today. Instead, prophesying is a particular gift given to a small number of the saints, and this small number become the clergy to build up a hierarchy. Because the rest of the saints do not know how to prophesy, they become &ldquo;laymen&rdquo; in the matter of prophesying. Concerning prophesying, most of the Christians are laymen. Just a few are the direct prophets. Therefore, there is a clergy and a laity. As long as there is the distinction between clergy and laity, hierarchy is here.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s economy, He wants all of His believers to prophesy, to speak Him and to speak Him forth. He does not want only a minority of His children to speak for Him to large congregations of passive believers. Whenever the Lord&rsquo;s children come together in the congregational way, only one person speaks for the Lord time after time. Among the congregation that is listening to him, there may be a number who are very gifted according to their natural birth. The spiritual gifts are always maintained and supported by the natural talents. Some saints are very talented, and because they love the Lord and the Lord is filling them, they have the Spirit richly. If we give these saints the opportunity to develop their capacity, they will have the top ability in speaking. The traditional system of one man speaking and the rest listening annuls, or at least conceals, many gifts. This kind of practice covers and conceals the riches of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In a congregation there may be one hundred living and real members of the Body of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s Body is rich in these members, and they have the capacity to speak for the Lord, but this capacity is annulled by the traditional practice. Even the pastors suffer under this practice. They may give marvelous messages to their congregations at the beginning, but after a period of years, their supply is limited. It is a real labor for these pastors to come up with a new message every Lord&rsquo;s Day. Most pastors take a position with another congregation after a period of years, and this cycle repeats itself. We need to see the deficiency in the practice of Christianity, by which we have been influenced.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is for all the saints in the local churches to be enabled to prophesy, to speak for the Lord. In 1 Corinthians14 Paul tells the saints that they all can prophesy one by one (v. 31). Traditional Christianity says that not all can prophesy but that only a few can. In the system of Christianity, the clergy is built up to be a hierarchy, leaving the rest of the believers robbed, annulled, killed, and disabled. This shows that we all have to learn to be perfected by the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. We may not be these gifted persons, but we can be perfected to do the same work that these gifted persons do. We are not prophets, but we can do the work of the prophets. We are not apostles, but we can do the work of the apostles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Evangelists</h2>
<p>The evangelists not only preach the gospel to save sinners, to bring people to Christ, but also perfect others to preach the gospel as they do. This is similar to what the professors in a teachers&rsquo; college do. They teach their students in order to make their students teachers. If a person is an evangelist, he should ask himself how many saints he has perfected to do the same work as he does. The evangelists listed in Ephesians 4:11 are those who preach the gospel to sinners to make them saints and who also perfect others to preach the gospel as they do.</p>
<p>After I got saved, I loved the Lord, and I liked to preach the gospel. No one charged me to preach the gospel, but I spontaneously did it. I even wrote a long gospel tract. I must honestly confess, however, that I did not know how to preach the gospel at that time. Eventually, someone did perfect me to preach the gospel. I was taught the truths concerning God&rsquo;s salvation, and I was also taught how to discern people. We need to discern people and preach the gospel to them according to the kind of person that they are. If someone is a lover of money, we need to preach the gospel to him in a particular way according to the kind of person he is. Acts 24 records that Paul preached the gospel to a Roman governor. This governor was a man of lust and corruption, so Paul preached the gospel, reasoning with him concerning righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment (v. 25). As a result, this Roman governor became afraid. We should not preach the gospel to a banker in the same way that we would to a fisherman. We cannot preach the gospel properly if we do not discern the people to whom we are preaching. This is why we need to be perfected to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>D. L. Moody, the great evangelist, was speaking to a certain lady after his preaching of the gospel to a large audience. At a certain critical point in D. L. Moody&rsquo;s talk with her, there was a distracting disturbance. That critical point of time was the right time for her to pray. After that disturbance, however, she would not pray to receive the Lord. From this story I was perfected to realize that when we are preaching the gospel to someone, we must be exercised to discern the right time to bring this person into prayer. If we do not pray with this person at that time, we will lose our case. The best salesmen do not talk too much. They talk just enough to close the deal. If they keep talking after a certain point when the deal can be closed, they will not be able to make the deal. We need the perfecting in order to preach the gospel properly.</p>
<p>There are many secrets to preaching the gospel successfully. We need to be perfected in certain skills in the preaching of the gospel. We need to learn how to begin our talk with people so that we can open up their heart quickly. It may be that the more we talk to people, the more we close their hearts. We need to be perfected to have the skill to open up people&rsquo;s hearts. If we receive the proper perfecting in the preaching of the gospel, we will become excellent preachers. This will enable us to speak to all our relatives and to get them saved.</p>
<p>In order to be perfected to do the work of the evangelists, we also have to know the crucial verses in the Bible for the preaching of the gospel. The Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses train their people with hundreds of verses before they go out to visit people. They do not believe that Christ is God, so they train their people to twist certain verses. If a person does not have a knowledge of the basic truths, he can be affected by the speaking of the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses. The Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses are a heretical group, but they train and equip their people to preach their &ldquo;gospel.&rdquo; Since they practice this way, how much more should we be trained and equipped to preach the truth of the gospel?</p>
<p>It is not that simple to preach the gospel. We are fruitless because we neglected the preaching of the gospel. According to our concept, anybody can preach the gospel. Actually, however, we need to be perfected to preach the gospel. We cannot say that everyone knows mathematics. A person cannot know mathematics until he is taught. We all need to be perfected to do the work of the evangelists. In Christianity there is not such a practice. We may have had the concept that evangelists should merely preach the gospel to others. We did not think that the evangelists had another important work, that is, to perfect others and make them able to preach as the evangelists do. We have to reconsider our practice. We cannot take the old, traditional way of service in Christianity. Some dear saints in the denominations attend Lord&rsquo;s Day morning services their entire life, and yet they do not know how to pray or preach the gospel.</p>
<p>We have to be perfected to preach the gospel as energizing priests who offer saved sinners to God as sacrifices. There is the expectation, the possibility, and even the capacity within every saint for them to be such priests. This capacity is in the divine life which the saints possess and enjoy. The very divine life which we enjoy today has a great capacity, but this capacity has been annulled by the traditional practice of Christianity. We have seen that the big gospel preaching meeting fulfills the purpose of saving sinners, but at the same time it annuls the believers&rsquo; capacity of preaching the gospel organically. This is because the practice of having only big gospel preaching meetings does not give the saints the chance to practice and to develop their organic function of preaching the gospel. On the other hand, the way of everyone preaching the gospel as New Testament priests develops the saints&rsquo; preaching function to the uttermost. According to the New Testament way, all of us have to visit the sinners with the gospel continually. We all have to practice the direct and personal preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>Most people are born with the capacity of being able to speak, but if they are not allowed to speak for many years, they will become dumb. The restriction of not being allowed to speak will annul their speaking function. Every mother expects her little babe to speak, and all the families encourage their little ones to speak, but does the church practice the preaching of the gospel in this way?</p>
<p>In the past, we had big gospel preaching meetings at certain intervals. In these meetings, one brother was appointed to give a gospel message. The leading brothers announced that the church was going to have a big gospel preaching meeting and that all should cooperate with the church in the preaching of the gospel. The saints may have been charged to invite people, to prepare the hall by cleaning it and arranging the chairs, to do the service of ushering, and to help the guests find certain passages in the Bible during the message. After the meeting ended, the saints could get the addresses and telephone numbers of their guests, but they did not directly preach the gospel to them. Instead, they only brought their guests to hear a certain brother preaching the gospel. As a result, the saints performed only a Levitical service, not the service of the priesthood. The brothers who preached in the big gospel preaching meeting spontaneously were built up as a hierarchy of clergy, while the rest of the saints were the laity in the preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>Most of the saints were not able to speak to people concerning basic matters like justification by faith and regeneration. Only a few brothers were able to do this. The practice of having only big gospel preaching meetings annuls the preaching ability of the saints, the organic function of the saints that they received in their divine birth. This organic function is in the divine life that we possess and enjoy today, but the traditional, unscriptural practice of Christianity does not allow this function to be developed. On the one hand, the big gospel preaching meeting fulfills the New Testament ministry in the matter of saving sinners, but at the same time it kills the ability, the capacity, and the organic function of all the believers which is in the divine life. Therefore, all of us need the universal perfection to enable us to do the work of the ministry.</p>
<p>Have we ever seen an evangelist not only going out to preach the gospel but also staying in a locality to perfect the saints to do the preaching work as he does? There has not been such a thing on this earth. Therefore, there are thousands of believers on this earth, and not many know how to preach the gospel. The preaching of the gospel by the big evangelists without their perfecting of the saints will kill the preaching ability of the common saints. If during the past forty years there had been a strong perfecting of the common saints to do the preaching of the gospel, there would have been a marvelous result. Instead, most Christians are not able to preach the gospel because of the wrong, traditional practice of Christianity. The evangelists should not only preach but also perfect others to preach. God did not give the evangelists just for the preaching of the gospel but for the perfecting of the saints.</p><h2 class="head2">The Shepherds and Teachers</h2>
<p>The final category of gifted persons listed in Ephesians 4:11 is the shepherds and teachers. The shepherds and teachers take care of the believers and teach the saints. According to the grammatical construction, &ldquo;shepherds and teachers&rdquo; refers to the same class of gifted persons. A shepherd should know how to teach, and a teacher should be able to shepherd. As we have pointed out, these gifted persons also perfect the saints to do the work that they themselves do.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:2 says that the elders should be apt to teach. This means that teaching has become habitual with them. Not only should the elders be able to teach, but also they must love to teach. First Timothy 5:17 says that the elders who take the lead well should be counted worthy of double honor, &ldquo;especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; &ldquo;Honor&rdquo; here refers to material supply. Because the elders are so busy, they may not have time to make a living, so they have to be job-dropping full-timers. These elders need the material supply and are worthy of it. All the elders should be apt to teach, but some are especially strong in teaching the Word.</p>
<p>Peter charged the elders not to lord it over the saints because they are God&rsquo;s possession, allotted to the elders for their care. He charged them to shepherd the saints and to become patterns of the flock (1 Pet. 5:2-3). Therefore, according to 1 Timothy and 1 Peter, the elders should both teach and shepherd the saints. Some may think that Paul never said that the Lord gave His Body elders. Instead, He gave His Body some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers. The elders, however, need to be the shepherds and teachers. An elder may think that Ephesians 4:11-12 does not apply to him, but an elder should be both a shepherd and a teacher.</p>
<p>Acts 13:1 tells us that in the church in Antioch there were prophets and teachers. It is difficult to say whether these prophets and teachers were also elders. Those who teach in the church are teachers in different degrees. There are teachers in universities, in high school, in junior high, in elementary school, and in kindergarten, but they are all teachers in different degrees. In the Body of Christ, the Head, Christ, raised up some teachers who are not elders. Also in the churches God established elders, and the elders should be apt to teach. This teaching of the elders is probably not as high or as deep as the teaching of the teachers. To teach in 1 Timothy 3:2 is similar to parents teaching their children. An elder must be apt to render this kind of home teaching to the members of a local church.</p>
<p>Parents may teach their children and even help them with their homework, but they are not able to teach at a university. A teacher teaches the children in the school, and the parents can help the children with their homework. The children not only need the teachers in the school but also need the parents as their teachers at home. The elders are the home teachers. There are also teachers who travel through the churches to hold conferences and give the churches messages full of revelation. Not all the elders can do this kind of teaching, but all the elders should do the home teaching. The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, including the elders, are able persons. These able persons do not merely do the work in their respective lines. The gifted persons only doing the work in their respective lines without perfecting the saints is the practice of today&rsquo;s Christianity. These gifted persons, including the elders, should also teach others to do what they do.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>All the gifted persons are for the perfecting of the saints (Eph. 4:12). The gifted persons not only do the work in their respective lines but also perfect the common believers to do what they (the gifted persons) do. To perfect the saints is to teach, equip, and furnish them. Just as the Army perfects soldiers by teaching them, equipping them, and furnishing them, the gifted persons need to perfect the saints. Furthermore, to perfect the saints is to make all the common believers like the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers so that they all can do the work of the ministry as the gifted persons do. Today among us there is an urgent need for the perfecting of the saints. We would like to see small numbers of saints migrating to cities and knowing how to set up the churches in these cities.</p>
<p>The work of the ministry is the work of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy for the building up of the organic Body of Christ. (In order to see the difference between the ministry, the work, and the churches, I recommend that we read Brother Nee&rsquo;s word at the conclusion of his famous book <em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em>&mdash;pp. 213-218.) After being perfected, the saints can do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY BEING<br />
THE WORK OF GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The work of the ministry is organic to help the organic members of the Body of Christ to grow in Christ with the divine life and elements of the processed Triune God by enjoying Him as their nourishment. When we have all these points, the building up is organic. Otherwise, what we have is altogether organizational. We need to labor organically until all the members of Christ are mature in the full growth of the divine life and reach the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13) for the organic building up of the organic Body of Christ, the very embodiment of the processed Triune God. The organic Body of Christ is the organism of the processed Triune God because Christ is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING PERFECTED UNTO THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>We need to be perfected to do the work of the gifted persons. Suppose that two families move to a city where there is no church life. They may feel that they need to ask a gifted brother to come to set up the church for them because they are not apostles and do not know how to set up the church. We may not be apostles, but we need to be perfected to do the apostles&rsquo; work. If we are perfected in this way, we will know how to set up a church when we move to another locality. Because we have been perfected, we will know how to go to sinners to get them saved and baptized. We will know how to feed them, how to bring them into the group meetings, and how to bring them to meet with the saints as the church. We will be enabled to set up a church. This kind of perfecting to enable the saints to do what the gifted persons do is God&rsquo;s ordained way.</p>
<p>It is a difficult process to set up a church in the system of Christianity. Some devoted ones must study at a seminary for four years in order to be ordained. There also need to be board meetings and fund raising; but according to the Bible, everything is simple. There is no need for us to graduate from seminary or to be officially ordained. We have already been ordained by the Lord (John 15:16; Matt. 28:19). We do not need to have a fundraising group or a church board. We can go out to preach the gospel to save sinners and baptize them into the Triune God. Then we can raise these ones up and perfect them to do the same thing that we do. After half a year or one year of being perfected, many saints will be enabled to go out and set up the churches.</p>
<p>Some who have moved to a new place may feel that they need some gifted ones to come to make a decision as to whether or not they should take the ground of the church there and begin having the Lord&rsquo;s table. This is like some saying that they have moved to a new city and they do not know how to cook. Because they do not know how to cook, they want someone to come to cook for them. Even if the saints there feel that they do not know &ldquo;how to cook,&rdquo; it is best for them to try. Eventually, they will learn how to cook by trying and making mistakes. We must see that there are two different kinds of concepts concerning the Lord&rsquo;s service. One is the traditional concept of Christianity, and the other is according to what is revealed in the Bible, the God-ordained way.</p>
<p>All of us, especially the elders, full-timers, and co-workers, should practice to perfect ourselves. In order to perfect ourselves we must first begin to live a priestly life. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I want to be perfected by You to live a priestly life. I want to be a priest on this earth.&rdquo; Regardless of whether we are a businessman, a professor, or a housewife, we should live a priest&rsquo;s life. The life of a priest is a victorious life, an overcoming daily life. The first practice of the priestly life is to visit sinners to get them saved. We need to ask the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, lead me and guide me in using my time to fulfill the first item of the priesthood in getting sinners saved to make them the sons of God and the members of Christ.&rdquo; I believe that the Lord will lead us.</p>
<p>A sister who is a housewife with four children is obviously very busy. Perhaps the Lord would lead her to go to the persons whom she knows already. Maybe she would only be able to visit people for the gospel once every two weeks. Regardless of the time period, all of us must make a budget of our time. We should set up a schedule to go out for the gospel in a regular and definite way. We can make a decision before the Lord to go out once every two weeks for two or three hours. It would be good if we would make a list of all the people we know, including our relatives, classmates, and colleagues. We can put their names on a list and pray for them. We can pray, &ldquo;Lord, among all these names, which one do You want me to visit first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to do things in cooperation with the Lord and not by ourselves, we have to pray much. We should always have a talk with the Lord. The Lord will lead us. If this is the condition of our living, we will be persons who are one with the Lord. We should pray before we go to preach the gospel and also go with prayer. As we go with prayer, we will surely go with the Lord, with the Lord&rsquo;s authority, and with the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty. We can ask the Lord to keep the person whom we are going to visit at home. The Lord will answer our prayer. We can also ask the Lord to prepare his heart and to prepare his environment and his overall situation so that he will be ready to receive the gospel. Then when we go, it will be so easy for us to talk to him, and he will be ready to receive the Lord and be baptized.</p>
<p>After we baptize people, we have to have a longer talk with them to nourish them. We need to learn how to converse with the newly baptized ones. The principle is that we should always say something organic. What we say should not merely be a kind of teaching or instruction, but should always be something in life. We should minister something of life to the new ones. That means that we should speak forth Christ into them, dispense Christ into them. We need to go back to the newly baptized ones as soon as possible. We should go back to them either the next day or at the least after two days. We have to go back to feed the new ones and to take care of them. Our practice of these matters will be our personal perfection. We have to go back to them again and again to nourish and cherish them. We also have to bring them to the group meetings and to the larger meetings of the church.</p>
<p>With the group meetings, we have to learn to keep away from any traditional, unscriptural, so-called worship. Our meeting should be full of the Word, the Spirit, singing, and praying. When we come together we have to learn how to fellowship. Our fellowship will bring in some interceding for one another. As we practice these things, we will perfect ourselves. The interceding and praying for one another will bring in the mutual care. The group meeting will issue in the shepherding of the saints. We also need to learn how to ask questions in a group meeting. We may know certain truths, but for the sake of the new beginners we can ask some questions. Then we can let all the attendants answer these questions.</p>
<p>As we practice we will perfect ourselves to such an extent that we will be able to conduct the group meetings to the highest degree. In our meetings we should have the living singing, the living praying, and the living fellowship. We have to learn to set up a pattern for others in the group meeting. When someone answers a question, we have to learn how to continue their answer in a little deeper way. We should not speak too long in order to give others the time to answer. As we practice, we will learn and get ourselves perfected. Then we will become a pattern, and our pattern will be a perfecting to others. The new ones will see what we do and practice the same thing.</p>
<p>Our learning of the scriptural way of meeting and serving can be compared to learning a language. If children grow up in an English-speaking home, they will spontaneously learn to speak English. In these homes there are patterns from whom they can learn. All of us should practice to be the pioneers in the practice of the present advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We can practice to perfect ourselves according to the fellowship we have received in this book. We can put this fellowship into practice to perfect ourselves, and spontaneously we will set up a pattern for others to follow. As we practice, this pattern will be improved all the time.</p>
<p>As we practice living the life of a priest, we will bring in the new ones. If each one of us takes care of one or two new ones, the church will increase in a positive and gradual way. We will gain a steady increase every year. The practice of the priesthood of the gospel is not a revival that only lasts for a short period of time. We do not want to be excited for a brief period of time and then have no exercise in the gospel afterwards. We need to live a proper life, a priestly life. We need to practice the priesthood, and the first step in this practice is to go to the sinners to get them saved. The second step is to care for them in the home meetings. The third step is to bring them into the group meetings and the larger meetings of the church. Then we will get them established and perfected. After one year, these new ones may be able to do at least part of what we are doing. Eventually, the whole church will be perfected to function. The entire church will be equipped to do the work of the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. Even though most of us are not these gifted persons, we can do the same work that they do. This is God&rsquo;s intention. I hope that all of us can be revolutionized in our concept. We all need to practice the fellowship that we have received.</p>
<p>Because there is not such a thing as the perfecting of the saints by the gifts on this earth, we must endeavor, we must labor, and we must struggle according to His operation which operates in us in power (Col. 1:29). We must cooperate with the Lord so that He can recover such a &ldquo;missing.&rdquo; I hope that within ten years thousands of believers around the earth will be perfected. While the saints still keep their regular jobs and pursuits, they can carry out the preaching of the gospel as New Testament priests to save sinners regularly as a part of their daily life. Each saint can take care of two or three new ones yearly, and this will be like small families raising up their children to form a big society.</p>
<p>I hope that we would study and prayerfully consider the fellowship in this chapter. Then we will see something new. Thus far, we have covered three things: the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament, the organic building up of the Body of Christ, and the perfecting of the saints by the gifts for this organic building. All these items are very high. When we see these items, we have the feeling that our present practice is far off. We have quite a distance to go in order for our present practice to reach the standard. Therefore, we all have to endeavor and labor with and in the Lord. May the Lord have mercy upon us.</p<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PROPHESYING FOR<br />
THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:3, 24, 25, 4, 5, 31, 1, 39; Eph. 4:12</h1>
<p>The first three major points of the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today are the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament, the organic building up of the Body of Christ, and the perfecting of the saints by the gifts. In this chapter we come to the last major point&mdash;the prophesying for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING IN 1 CORINTHIANS 14 BEING<br />
NOT IN THE SENSE OF PREDICTING, FORETELLING,<br />
BUT IN THE SENSE OF SPEAKING FOR THE LORD,<br />
SPEAKING FORTH THE LORD,<br />
TO DISPENSE CHRIST TO PEOPLE</h2>
<p>According to our knowledge, 1 Corinthians 14 is a chapter that has not been properly touched by Christians in a practical way throughout the history of the church since the time of the early church. Actually, it is a very simple chapter. This chapter exhorts us to desire earnestly to prophesy. Thank the Lord that there is such a chapter in the Bible. It expresses the apostle&rsquo;s desire for all of us to prophesy. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; Then verse 39 at the end of the chapter says, &ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy.&rdquo; In verse 4 Paul says that &ldquo;he who prophesies builds up the church.&rdquo; Then in verse 12 he says, &ldquo;So also you, since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have to consider what it means to prophesy. According to our natural concept, to prophesy is to merely predict, or foretell. This concept is prevailing in the Pentecostal movement. In 1963 some Pentecostal believers &ldquo;prophesied&rdquo; that there would be a great earthquake in Los Angeles and that the entire city would fall into the ocean. Of course, such an event did not take place. In 1964 some &ldquo;prophesied&rdquo; again that there would be a great earthquake, but nothing happened. The meaning of prophesying has been spoiled by the Pentecostal teaching and practice. When those in the Pentecostal movement talk about prophesying according to 1 Corinthians 14, they talk about it in a wrong way.</p>
<p>The truth concerning prophesying is a big problem to many expositors and students of the Bible. What does it mean to prophesy? We must admit that prophesying does convey the thought of foretelling, predicting. Most people, whether Christians or non-Christians, understand prophesying in this way. But we all have to see that prophesying in chapter fourteen of 1 Corinthians is not used in this sense at all. The interpretation of prophesying as predicting does not fit in the context of this entire chapter. Prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is not in the sense of predicting, foretelling, but in the sense of speaking for the Lord, speaking forth the Lord, to dispense Christ to people.</p>
<p>Even in the Old Testament, to prophesy is not mainly to predict. The book of Isaiah the prophet has sixty-six chapters, and most of these chapters are not predicting but are speaking for the Lord. Of course, Isaiah&rsquo;s prophesying also includes foretelling, but mainly his prophesying in the book of Isaiah is his speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord. Chapter one of Isaiah, in which he rebuked the people of Israel, is a chapter of his speaking for the Lord. The main denotation of the word <em>prophesy</em> both in Hebrew and in Greek is to speak for the Lord. When we speak for the Lord, even if we do not foretell, our speaking is the genuine prophesying. To prophesy is to speak God into people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Speak to Men Building Up for the Church,<br />
Encouragement for the Believers,<br />
and Consolation for the Saints&rsquo; Welfare</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14:3 says, &ldquo;But he who prophesies speaks to men building up and encouragement and consolation.&rdquo; Building up is for the church, encouragement is for the believers, and consolation is for the saints&rsquo; spiritual welfare. Building up, encouragement, and consolation are not foretelling or predicting. These items indicate that to prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord. Some thoughtful people may wonder how we can interpret 1 Corinthians 14:3 in this way since this verse does not say directly that to prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord. Instead, it says that he who prophesies speaks to men building up, encouragement, and consolation. We need to realize, however, that building up, encouragement, and consolation are Christ Himself.</p>
<p>To speak building up is to speak Christ. Without Christ, how can we build up the church? To speak building up equals to speak Christ. Paul is a marvelous writer. He did not say directly that to prophesy is to speak Christ. If he just said this, people might understand Christ in a general way as being our Savior and our Lord. Instead, Paul said that to prophesy is to speak building up. To speak building up is something deeper. This building up is the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the church. With what can we build up the Body of Christ? Can we build up the Body of Christ with our learning or our ability? Surely not. We can only build up the Body of Christ with Christ.</p>
<p>Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 3 that we build up the church with gold, silver, and precious stones (v. 12). Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the three main characteristics of the Triune God, and the embodiment of the Triune God is Christ (Col. 2:9). Therefore, to speak building up is to speak Christ as the very material with which the church is built up. The Triune God is the building material of the church in three aspects. The church is built with God the Father in His divine nature as the gold, with God the Son in His redemption as the silver, and with God the Spirit in His transforming work as the precious stones. Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the Triune God in His three main characteristics as the building material for the building of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>If the Triune God were not embodied in Christ, He could not be the materials with which we could build the church. The Triune God is the processed Triune God. He is not the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; Triune God. Before incarnation, God was &ldquo;raw.&rdquo; This is similar to saying that a fish is raw before it is cooked. The cooking of the fish is the processing of the fish for us to eat. To be processed is to be cooked. Our God is the Triune God. He is not &ldquo;raw&rdquo; but processed. John 1:14 records the first step of His process. The first process the Triune God passed through was incarnation. In eternity past the Triune God was merely divine. With Him there was nothing human, but one day He entered into the womb of a human virgin and stayed there for nine months. This divine conception was a process for the divine God to become a human being. From that time, He was a God-man. Before this conception He was only divine, but after His human birth, He is not only divine but also human. He is not only God but also a man.</p>
<p>After He was born, He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. He was the unique God-man, a man living with God and God living in man. He lived in Nazareth in a carpenter&rsquo;s home for thirty years in His process of human living. After passing through human living, He passed through the process of death. In one sense, He was crucified by others, but in another sense, He gave Himself to be crucified. John 10 tells us that He laid down His life by His own decision. He had the authority to lay it down and the authority to take it again (vv. 11, 17-18). If He had not made the decision to walk into death, who could have put Him on the cross? When Judas came with a band of soldiers to seize Him, Peter took a sword and cut off the right ear of the slave of the high priest. He then told Peter, &ldquo;Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?&rdquo; (John 18:11). This shows that He made the decision to walk into death.</p>
<p>After His crucifixion, the Lord took a &ldquo;tour&rdquo; of Hades. First Peter 3 tells us that He went to the &ldquo;spirits in prison&rdquo; to proclaim His triumphant victory (vv. 19-20). He walked through the process of death, walked out of death, and entered into resurrection. Resurrection was another process that He passed through. In resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In resurrection He also appeared to His disciples. His body was a visible, touchable body, yet He suddenly appeared in the room where the disciples were, without entering through a door (John 20:19). His body was a resurrected body, a spiritual body (1 Cor. 15:44), and a body of glory (Phil. 3:21). Then He breathed Himself into His disciples (John 20:22) to remain in the disciples&rsquo; spirits. After breathing Himself into them, He appeared to them at times and disappeared. He did this for forty days after His resurrection (Acts 1:3) to train the disciples to enjoy His invisible, indwelling presence.</p>
<p>Through resurrection He entered into another process, ascension. He brought His disciples to Mount Olivet and ascended before them to the third heaven (Acts 1:9). According to Ephesians, Christ ascended with a train of His defeated foes (Eph. 4:8). All of us were conquered and carried to heaven by Christ in His ascension, and Christ presented us to the Father. The Father then gave us back to Christ as gifts (Psa. 68:18), and Christ gave us as gifts to His Body for its building up (Eph. 4:11-12).</p>
<p>In His ascension, as a man in resurrection, He received the lordship, the headship, the authority, and the kingship. He was the Lord when He was God, but as a man He was not the Lord before His ascension. Passing through the processes of death and resurrection, He entered into the process of ascension, and in His ascension God made Him, a man, the very Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). The Christ is the One who carries out God&rsquo;s great commission of accomplishing God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. He was made by God the Father the very authority of the universe and the very Savior of God&rsquo;s chosen people (Acts 5:31). As the authority of the universe, He can manage the entire universe for the advancement of His gospel. Without His managing of the universe, we could have never been in a position to hear the gospel. Eventually, Christ poured Himself out on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:16-18, 33), and that pouring out formed the church. From that time, He has been both within the church and upon the church. He became the very constituent, element, and material for the building up of the church. The church is built up with such a Christ.</p>
<p>Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God passed through step after step from incarnation to ascension. These steps were His processes. Now in His ascension as the very embodiment of the Triune God, He is no longer the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God. God has now been fully processed. The processed God in His divine Trinity has become the building material of the Body of Christ. The Triune God is altogether embodied in Christ, so Christ is actually the building material of the Body of Christ. When we speak building up for the church, we actually speak Christ. When Paul says that to prophesy is to speak building up, we have to consider what this means. We need the entire Bible to explain this building up. Paul indicates that to prophesy is to speak Christ, but He does this in a mysterious, hidden, and secret way.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:3 also says that to prophesy is to speak encouragement. While I am speaking, I may realize that some of the audience is discouraged. Therefore, I have to speak encouragement to them to stir them up. When I speak encouragement to the saints, I speak Christ. Who or what can encourage us? Many times we get deflated, disappointed, and discouraged. A better job, a bigger car, or a Ph.D. cannot provide real encouragement. On this earth nothing is encouraging. Instead everything is rather discouraging. The way that we Christians are taking is a way which the world discourages. The tide of this world is going downhill, and we are going against the current, the tide, of this world. As Christians we are not going downhill but, uphill. While we are going uphill, everything is fighting against us. Our relatives, friends, and classmates may discourage us. Even some of our brothers in Christ are not encouraging us but discouraging us.</p>
<p>If we take the way of going downhill, the world will encourage us to go downhill. Our relatives may encourage us not to go to the church meetings so often. They may tell us that we were too hot a few years ago, but that now we are acting properly by not attending so many church meetings. Two years ago we may have been going uphill, but today we are going downhill. Our mother, father, and relatives may highly appraise this. Everything in this world encourages us to go downhill, but when we are going uphill, everything is against us. Everything in this world becomes a kind of discouragement to us. Therefore, in every Christian meeting there is the need of encouragement. In the meetings we need to speak Christ as encouragement. To say that we are speaking Christ is too general, but speaking encouragement is to speak Christ in a particular way. Christ Himself is the unique encouragement.</p>
<p>The elders in the church need encouragement every day. Christ is the encouragement to the elders. To be an elder is not an easy thing. Many elders can testify that they receive more discouragement than encouragement. For the church life, for the building up of the Body of Christ, we need encouragement every day. Discouraging matters may come to us, but we should always exercise to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Calling on the Lord can bring us out of our discouragement into the heavenlies. In 1 Corinthians 14, Paul refers to Christ hiddenly and mysteriously. To build up the church is the goal of God&rsquo;s economy. For this building up we must experience Christ as our encouragement every day. Christ is not only the material, the constituents, for the building up of the Body of Christ but also the encouragement for the building up of His Body. To prophesy we need to speak Christ as encouragement.</p>
<p>Christ is also consolation. He is the only One who is a consolation to us. Consolation implies more than comfort. To be consoled is to be comforted in the depths of our being. Christ Himself is our consolation. When I speak consolation, I am speaking Christ as consolation. As long as we have building up, encouragement, and consolation, we can build up the Body of Christ. When Paul tells us that to prophesy is to speak building up, encouragement, and consolation, he means that to prophesy is to speak Christ as these items.</p>
<p>To prophesy is to speak to men Christ in every aspect. This is based upon the entire teaching of 1 Corinthians. This book presents Christ in many aspects. First Corinthians teaches that Christ is &ldquo;theirs and ours&rdquo; (1:2). This means that Christ is our portion, and we have been called by God the Father into the fellowship of this portion (v. 9). The fellowship of this portion is the enjoyment of this portion. Chapter one goes on to tell us that God has put us into Christ and made Christ wisdom to us from God. This wisdom comprises three items&mdash;righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (v. 30). Righteousness is for our past to be justified by God; sanctification is for our present to live a holy life; and redemption is for our future to have our body transfigured, redeemed. First Corinthians teaches us to participate in Christ as everything to us. We need to understand 1 Corinthians 14 based upon this realization. To speak building up, encouragement, and consolation is really to speak Christ as our enjoyment. We enjoy Him as the building up of the church, as our daily encouragement, and as our constant consolation. Thus, to prophesy is to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, and to speak Christ into others, to dispense Christ into others as everything.</p><h2 class="head2">To Convict People, to Judge People,<br />
Exposing the Secrets of People&rsquo;s Hearts</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14 goes on to say that when the whole church comes together and all prophesy, a new one will be convicted by all and judged by all, having the secrets of his heart exposed (vv. 23-25). The first convicting and judging one in the New Testament was John the Baptist. This one who was apart from culture and religion, wearing camel&rsquo;s hair, eating locusts and wild honey, and working wildly, called people to repent. His convicting and his judging led people to Christ. John the Baptist told people that they had to go to Christ as the One who was stronger than he was. Convicting and judging always lead people to Christ. When we get convicted and judged, we would say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, forgive me.&rdquo; We may even say this with tears. Paul says that to prophesy is to convict people and to judge people. He means that this is the way to bring people to Christ and to lead people to receive Christ, to take Christ. Therefore, what Paul is saying is that to prophesy is to speak Christ.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:23-25 says, &ldquo;If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak in tongues, and the unlearned or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are insane? But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all; the secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Insane&rdquo; means mad or even raving mad. This word is a strong discouragement to the excessive practice of speaking in tongues. Paul says, however, that if all prophesy, something marvelous happens. Prophesying is not prediction but the speaking of God. Such speaking convicts and judges people, exposing the secrets of people&rsquo;s hearts. It is not so easy for people to be convicted. All of us like to justify and vindicate ourselves. However, when all the saints prophesy, speak for the Lord, the unbelievers and unlearned persons are convicted and judged by all. They will be amazed at our speaking that exposes their real situation and the secrets of their hearts.</p>
<p>I can still remember the time when I preached in a large gospel meeting in January of 1942. I spoke something in the meeting that exposed the real situation of a certain lady. She was upset with the sister who brought her to the meeting, thinking that this sister had told me about her. The sister told her that she had not told me anything about her. She told this lady that this showed that our God, our Jesus Christ, is living and that He spoke an intimate word to her. The sister told her that this was the Lord&rsquo;s speaking to her. This word inspired that lady, and soon afterwards she believed in the Lord and was baptized. Things like this happen when we prophesy. Our speaking of Christ exposes the secrets of people&rsquo;s hearts, and they are turned to the Lord.</p>
<p>When the whole church comes together and each one prophesies, the new ones, either non-Christians or believers, will be convicted and judged. This is quite meaningful. Whenever we have a Christian meeting, God speaks through the saints in that meeting. He does not merely speak through some gifted persons who become a clerical class. According to Paul&rsquo;s thought in 1 Corinthians 14, all the attendants prophesy, not just a clerical class. When all prophesy, and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all. Any church meeting should be convicting through the speaking of the saints, through the prophesying of the saints. Because this is what the Bible says, we have to bow our heads and say, &ldquo;Amen, Lord. We like to see that whenever we come together as the church, You would speak through us.&rdquo; Also, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, whenever the church comes together, speak through me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 14, an unbeliever or an unlearned person is not convicted by only one person. He is convicted by all. One person speaking is not that convincing or convicting. When we all speak the same thing, this meeting is very convicting. Let us suppose that a newcomer is in the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. Perhaps on Saturday this new one had a problem with his boss. He may be upset with the way his boss treats him. He may feel that his boss treats him like a &ldquo;dog&rdquo; and that he hates his boss. When he comes into the church meeting with all prophesying, he will be convicted by all and judged by all, and the secrets of his heart will be manifested. Perhaps a young brother will stand up and share, &ldquo;We should not hate anyone.&rdquo; Then a young sister may say, &ldquo;Hating people is the pathway to the lake of fire.&rdquo; An older saint may say, &ldquo;Throughout my life, I have experienced that hating people really hurts us. The Bible tells us we need to love our neighbors as ourselves.&rdquo; If many saints in the meeting share on the same subject of loving others, this person certainly will be convicted by all and judged by all. All the saints&rsquo; speaking will expose exactly what is in his heart. Someone may even say, &ldquo;You hate your boss because you feel that he treats you like a dog.&rdquo; When a new one is at a meeting like this, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among us. God expresses Himself through His prophesying people.</p>
<p>In a church meeting, a young sister may stand up and share how it is so easy for us to lose our temper. She may go on to say that although she loves her mother to the uttermost, she got angry with her. Because of this, she had to repent to the Lord and ask for forgiveness and also ask her mother for forgiveness. A new one who is in the meeting may be a person who easily loses his temper with his mother. When he hears this sharing from this young sister, he will be convicted. Another brother may stand up and say that although we are all sinners, we can be forgiven and regenerated by praying to the Lord Jesus to receive Him by confessing our sins and calling upon His name. This brother may go on to say that when we call upon His name, His Spirit comes into us to regenerate us. Just after these two sharings, this new one may believe and be saved because he was convicted, judged, and exposed. When the church meeting is a meeting of mutuality in which all the saints prophesy, the riches of Christ are exhibited. We have to overthrow the old traditional way of Christianity in which only one man speaks and the rest listen. That practice robs all the saints of their right to speak forth Christ.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that there is a pastor with a congregation of five hundred people. This pastor may be a wonderful speaker. Eventually, however, his congregation will become tired of his speaking. When the newcomers hear him, they will say that his speaking is marvelous, but the older ones in his congregation are used to his speaking. They will become tired and bored of his speaking. For the long run, the practice of one man speaking tires people out. After a period of time, there is no freshness with this person&rsquo;s speaking; instead, there is staleness. The practice of one man speaking and the rest listening is the man-made way, the natural way, the way according to the customs of human society.</p>
<p>The practice of all prophesying cannot be seen in Christianity. The practice of today&rsquo;s Christianity is traditional, natural, and according to the customs of society. Regardless of how powerful or capable a speaker is, his speaking cannot be as rich as the speaking of all the saints. The practice of one man speaking and the rest listening has become a custom in Christianity. When only one person speaks in a meeting of the church, the riches of God cannot be exhibited in a full way. In <em>Church Affairs,</em> Brother Nee says that we all need to exercise to push this traditional practice away. If we all push against the way of one man speaking and the rest listening, eventually we will push it away.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 14, when the church comes together, everybody has an equal opportunity to speak. Because of this, there is a kind of spiritual principle that no one should speak too long in the church meetings. The church in Taipei has entered into the practice of 1 Corinthians 14, and there is an understood principle with them that no one should prophesy longer than three minutes. If we practice this way, at least twenty persons can have an opportunity to speak for the Lord in one hour. When equal opportunity is given to all the saints, the riches of Christ will come out.</p>
<p>The kind of meeting in which one gifted person speaks and the rest of the saints listen may be considered as a ministry meeting. This kind of meeting is also in the Bible, but this is not the church meeting of mutuality that Paul is talking about in 1 Corinthians 14. Acts 20 tells us that Paul stayed in Troas for seven days. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day, Paul spoke to the saints there until midnight. One young man who was overcome by sleep fell from the third story and was taken up dead. Paul went down to raise that man up, and everyone was happy. After the Lord&rsquo;s table, Paul continued to talk to them until daybreak. This meeting in Troas was a special meeting in which Paul could fulfill his apostolic function. That meeting was a real conference. I do not think that anyone other than Paul could speak for such a long time. This kind of meeting is different from the regular meetings of the church. In the regular meetings of the church, everyone can function. We do not need to be able to speak like the Apostle Paul or like other gifted brothers. We all can prophesy in a short and living way for the building up of the church, Christ&rsquo;s organic Body.</p>
<p>If we prophesy without the Spirit and without life, what we say will be altogether inorganic. We may feel to speak only because of our duty and obligation to the charge of the elders. If we only speak to carry out our obligation apart from the Spirit and life, what we speak will be mere doctrine. When we speak, our speaking should be full of the Spirit and life. If all of us speak in such a way in the meetings of the church, everyone will be impressed with the riches of Christ and the presence of God. The speaking of Christ convicts people, judges people, and exposes all the hidden things in their heart. Thus, they have to kneel down to worship God and report that God is really among us. We are God&rsquo;s speaking people. Whenever we come together, our meeting must be a speaking meeting. It must be a meeting speaking God, speaking for God, speaking forth God, and speaking God into people. This is God&rsquo;s divine dispensing.</p>
<p>My burden is to speak the truth to God&rsquo;s children. Today many pastors learn how to be eloquent and even speak words that make people laugh. We are not burdened to speak in this way. We want the words that we speak to be words of spirit and life. As believers, we all have to prophesy. We should not think that it is that difficult to speak for the Lord. We do not need to be specially gifted persons in order to speak Christ. I hope that all of us would take the holy Word from the Bible and put it into practice.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Prophesying Being for the Building Up<br />
of the Church, Which Is the Organism<br />
of the Triune God, in the Way of Life</h2>
<p>Prophesying is for the building up of the church, which is the organism of the processed Triune God, in the way of life (1 Cor. 14:4-5). When Christ is spoken into us as building up, encouragement, and consolation and when we are convicted and judged to turn to Christ, Christ is gained by us as nourishment. Encouragement and consolation are a nourishment. To be convicted and judged brings us to Christ. Then we receive Christ and gain Christ. Whenever we gain Christ, the Christ gained by us becomes our support, our supply, and our nourishment, and then we grow. Our growth is the building up of the Body of Christ. The Apostle Paul&rsquo;s speaking is centered on Christ for the building up of His mystical Body to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<p>Everyone prophesying for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ has not been seen in Christianity. Because Christianity has become deformed in relation to the divine revelation, we have to come back to the Scriptures. The Lord desires to recover 1 Corinthians 14. I believe that now is the time, at the end of this age, for the Lord to recover 1 Corinthians 14 among us. The Lord has been preparing us for this recovery for the past sixty-seven years, since 1922. I feel that now is the time and that we are the people to give the Lord a way to recover the truth seen and written by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 14.</p><h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING BEING<br />
THE EXCELLING GIFT AMONG ALL THE GIFTS,<br />
MAKING ITS SEEKERS EXCELLING</h2>
<p>Prophesying is the excelling gift among all the gifts, making its seekers excelling (1 Cor. 14:12). The Greek word for &ldquo;excel&rdquo; in 1 Corinthians 14:12 can also be translated &ldquo;abound.&rdquo; The way this word is translated depends upon its context. When this Greek word is used for matters of quantity, it means to abound. When it is used for matters in comparison, it means to excel. First Corinthians 14 does not talk about matters of quantity. It talks about the quality of spiritual gifts in comparison. In particular, Paul is comparing speaking in tongues with prophesying. He talks about the superiority of prophesying over speaking in tongues. Comparatively speaking, speaking in tongues is very low, whereas prophesying is very high. The value of speaking in tongues is minimal. To prophesy is much higher and more valuable than speaking in tongues because prophesying builds up the church. Therefore, Paul tells the Corinthians that since they are zealous of spiritual gifts, they should seek to excel to the building up of the church. We become excelling when we seek to prophesy because prophesying builds up the church as the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Excelling in Revealing God&rsquo;s Heart, God&rsquo;s Will, God&rsquo;s Way, and God&rsquo;s Economy to His People</h2>
<p>Prophesying is excelling in revealing God&rsquo;s heart, God&rsquo;s will, God&rsquo;s way, and God&rsquo;s economy to His people. When we prophesy, we speak what is on God&rsquo;s heart, and we speak God&rsquo;s will, God&rsquo;s way, and God&rsquo;s economy. Actually, all the Epistles written by the apostles are books of prophecy, not in the sense of prediction, but in the sense of speaking for God and speaking forth God into people. There are some predictions in the Epistles, but mainly they speak for Christ, speak forth Christ, and speak Christ into people, dispense Christ into people.</p>
<p>Some may consider that the entire book of Revelation is merely a book of prediction, but this book is a speaking forth of the Lord to His people. Whenever I read the book of Revelation, Christ is ministered to me. When I read this book, I have the feeling that Christ is dear and near to me, that He is so intimate and lovable. The more we read the book of Revelation, the more we will love Christ. If you read the book of Revelation, and you only receive an impression of predictions, that proves that you do not know how to read the Bible properly and that you do not understand the Bible. If we know how to read the Bible and understand the Bible, our impression from reading Revelation will not be of predictions, but of a dear One and a near One, who is so lovable and intimate to us. If we know the New Testament, whatever book or page we read, we will be impressed with the present Christ, the Christ today, the Christ this hour. Paul prophesied by writing his fourteen Epistles. Peter prophesied by writing his two Epistles. James, John, and Jude did the same by writing their Epistles. All the Epistles are prophesyings. In the Epistles, we can see God&rsquo;s heart, God&rsquo;s will, God&rsquo;s way, and God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Excelling in Convicting People,<br />
Exposing People&rsquo;s Real Condition,<br />
and Showing People Their Spiritual Need</h2>
<p>Prophesying is also excelling in convicting people, exposing people&rsquo;s real condition, and showing people their spiritual need. When people read the twenty-two Epistles of the New Testament, including the book of Revelation, they are convicted, judged, and all the secrets of their hearts are exposed, especially the evil secrets. Such speaking shows people their real need, not in material things but in spiritual things. This is why we encourage people to read the New Testament. The four Gospels plus the book of Acts may be considered as historical books. The twenty-two Epistles that follow these books are all prophesying. Each Epistle exposes our condition and shows us our real spiritual need in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Excelling in Speaking Forth Christ<br />
to Minister and Dispense Christ<br />
to People for Their Nourishment</h2>
<p>Prophesying is excelling in speaking forth Christ to minister and dispense Christ to people for their nourishment. To prophesy is to dispense Christ into people just as a waiter or a waitress in a restaurant dispenses food to people. When we prophesy, we are dispensing Christ as food to others. What people receive from our prophesying is not a prediction but food for their nourishment.</p>
<p>Perhaps a brother would stand up and say, &ldquo;Christ today is our portion. God has given us, His saints, Christ. This Christ has been allotted to all of us. He is our lot, our portion, and God has called us into the fellowship of this portion, the enjoyment of this portion. We all have been put by God into Christ, and God has made Him our wisdom. In this wisdom, God allotted Christ to us as our righteousness to cover our past, as our sanctification for our present daily walk, and as our redemption in the future so that our body can be redeemed in transfiguration. Thank the Lord for Christ as our portion.&rdquo; This is a direct speaking of Christ. When a brother speaks in this way, he is speaking forth Christ and speaking Christ into people. This kind of direct prophesying dispenses, distributes, Christ as our enjoyment into all the believers. As we all prophesy in this way, we dispense Christ mutually into one another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Excelling in Building Up the Church<br />
in the Organic Way That It May Be Built Up<br />
as the Organism of the Processed Triune God<br />
for His Fullness, His Expression</h2>
<p>Prophesying is excelling in building up the church in the organic way that it may be built up as the organism of the processed Triune God for His fullness, His expression. The four factors which we have pointed out above show that prophesying is the excelling gift for the building up of the church, making its seekers excelling.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that the Lord is going to recover the practice of 1 Corinthians 14. Eventually, what the Lord spoke in 1 Corinthians 14 will be fulfilled. The fellowship printed in this book will exist for years to come. If what I am speaking here is not fulfilled in this century, it may be fulfilled in the next century. To the Lord one thousand years are just one day (2 Pet. 3:8). What I have spoken in this book will remain on this globe. Many of the saints will fellowship about this, will be brought into this, and will practice this because it is in the holy Word. Besides God Himself, nothing in this universe is more valuable than the holy Word. First Corinthians 14 is a particular chapter in the holy Word. Paul stressed the matter of all prophesying in this chapter, and he told us we need to pursue, desire, seek, excel, and learn to prophesy. We all have to receive the heavenly enlightenment. We should pray, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord. Thank You for Your speaking. Thank You for Your revelation. Thank You for opening 1 Corinthians 14. Have mercy upon me, Lord. Bring me into the practice of this chapter. While I am living on this earth, I want to be a person who is always prophesying, speaking Christ.&rdquo;</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PROPHESYING FOR<br />
THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:3, 24, 25, 4, 5, 31, 1, 39; Eph. 4:12</h1>
<p>In the last chapter we saw that the fourth major item in the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is the prophesying for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ. Prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is not in the sense of predicting but in the sense of speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord to dispense Christ to people. It is the excelling gift among all the gifts, making its seekers excelling.</p>
<p>In this chapter we want to see three more crucial points related to prophesying: first, all the believers have the capacity and the obligation to prophesy; second, all the believers have been charged by the apostle to pursue, to desire earnestly, and to seek to prophesy; and third, in the Lord&rsquo;s advanced recovery, there is the need for the highest meetings of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THE BELIEVERS<br />
HAVING THE CAPACITY TO PROPHESY<br />
AND HAVING THE OBLIGATION TO PROPHESY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Capacity Being in the Divine Life,<br />
Which the Believers Possess and Enjoy<br />
and Which Needs to Increase within Them<br />
That the Capacity May Be Developed<br />
unto Their Ability</h2>
<p>All the believers have the capacity to prophesy and have the obligation to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:31, 24). The capacity is the ability. First Corinthians 14:31 says that we can all prophesy one by one. The word <em>can</em> indicates the capacity, the ability, to prophesy. Any kind of life has a certain capacity. The peach tree has its life, and in this life there is the capacity to produce peaches. In our human life, there are many capacities. There is the capacity to hear, to see, to smell, to speak, and to eat. A normal child&rsquo;s organs are complete at his birth. With all the organs are the capacities. These capacities need growth, development, and practice. A little infant learns to walk through growth, development, and practice. His capacity to walk is developed based on the growth in life with the help of some instruction from his parents. By practicing, he is gradually able to progress from crawling to standing to walking. Eventually, he is able to run and jump. This is an example of the capacities in our human life.</p>
<p>There are also capacities in the divine life that we have received. Through regeneration we received another life, the divine life, which is the eternal life. The divine life is eternal in space, in time, and in quality. It is altogether unlimited. This life is full of capacities, and the most striking capacity is the capacity to speak for God, to prophesy.</p>
<p>The capacity to prophesy is in the divine life, which the believers possess and enjoy and which needs to increase within them that the capacity may be developed unto their ability. Because we have the divine life, we have the capacity to speak Christ. We possess and enjoy the divine life, and this divine life needs to increase within us. We all need to grow with the increase of God. The increase of God within us increases our capacity so that this capacity is developed unto our ability.</p>
<p>Right after someone receives the Lord Jesus and is regenerated, a desire is put within him to speak something for Christ. He may not know how to speak, but this desire is within him. As he begins to speak in the meetings of the church, his speaking function develops. As he continues to practice speaking, he is like a babe who learns to stand, to walk, and eventually to run and jump. His spiritual function is developed through his practice.</p>
<p>Fifty-seven years ago a small church was raised up in my hometown. That was the first church in north China in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in 1932. I have been attending meetings regularly since that day. By attending all these meetings, I have received much instruction. Through this instruction and growth in life, my capacity to prophesy has been developed. Today it is so easy for me to prophesy. As we attend the meetings regularly and practice speaking with some instruction, we will be perfected to prophesy.</p>
<p>A newborn babe who is only five days old is not able to speak, but as he grows in life, there is the increase of his capacity to speak. At a certain point he is able to say &ldquo;ma ma&rdquo; and &ldquo;da da.&rdquo; As he grows in life, the capacity to speak within him is developed. How much someone can speak depends upon how much growth he has had. The growth of the human life develops the capacities of the human life. Besides our growth in life, we still need the practice. If a newborn babe is never allowed to speak throughout the course of his life, he will eventually not be able to speak because he has not practiced speaking. The strategy of Satan is to make only a small group of people, the clergy, a speaking class. By devising the clergy-laity system, Satan has made the majority of the Lord&rsquo;s children dumb.</p>
<p>We need to abandon the old way of one man speaking and the rest listening. In 1937 Brother Watchman Nee, who brought the revelation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to us, saw that the practice of one man speaking and the rest listening in the meetings of the church is not scriptural. He talked about this in <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> He pointed out in this book that the church meeting should be a meeting of mutuality. We did not find a way to practice what Brother Nee passed on to us. He mentioned this matter again in 1948, and this fellowship is in the book entitled <em>Church Affairs.</em>
 As I began to reconsider our way beginning in 1984, I realized that now is the time for us to practice our senior brother&rsquo;s vision. He saw the vision fifty-two years ago, and now we must practice it. We need to cooperate with the Lord to enter into this scriptural way. In endeavoring in this scriptural way, we should not be disappointed. Whenever we change from an old way to a new way, it is difficult for us. But as we practice, we will eventually be brought into it. When we practice the truth in the Bible, the Triune God will be with us, and we all will enter into this truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Obligation to Prophesy Being<br />
the Fulfillment of Their Spiritual Service,<br />
in Which They Are Indebted to God&rsquo;s Salvation</h2>
<p>The obligation to prophesy is the fulfillment of our spiritual service, in which we are indebted to God&rsquo;s salvation. Verse 24 says that if all prophesy the unbelievers and unlearned persons are convicted and judged. Verse 31 says that we can all prophesy one by one. These verses show that we all should bear the responsibility to prophesy. We all have the obligation to prophesy. It is so good that we have the capacity to prophesy. This should encourage us. But we also have to realize that we have the obligation to prophesy. We owe something to God and to His dynamic salvation. His salvation is with, by, and in the divine life. In this dynamic salvation, there is the capacity to prophesy. Furthermore, since we are enjoying such a salvation, we are indebted to this salvation. It is our duty to prophesy for the building up of the church. We have received the dynamic salvation, yet we have been annulled by the traditional practice that made us passive. We have to drop the way of the clergy-laity system and come back to the way of every member functioning for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Many of the saints have never prophesied according to the revelation of 1 Corinthians 14. When any of us speaks in a meeting, that meeting becomes the top meeting to us. A certain meeting may be high, but if we do not speak in that meeting, we do not appreciate it that much. A high meeting may be poor in our sight because we did not speak. Even if a meeting was low, if we spoke in that meeting, it became the best meeting to us. To us it was the best meeting because we spoke something. If all of us come together as &ldquo;pew members,&rdquo; that meeting will be full of death. But if all of us come together, and all of us exercise to speak one by one, that meeting will be in the heavens. It will be the highest meeting.</p>
<p>Some may feel that they do not know how to speak, but I do not believe that we do not know how. Who among us cannot tell people that the Lord Jesus is good? Someone in the meeting can say, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus is good.&rdquo; Another one can follow by saying, &ldquo;Yes, the Lord is good. Even this morning I tasted Him in His presence.&rdquo; All of us, one by one, can at least speak one sentence concerning Christ. On the other hand, we may speak for five minutes, but our speaking may be a &ldquo;sea story&rdquo; with little content of Christ. We should not think that just because all speak, the meeting will be heavenly. If we all speak things other than Christ, the meeting will be full of death. A brother may even speak things in a scriptural way with quotations from the Bible, but his speaking may not be the actual speaking of Christ.</p>
<p>Throughout the history of the church, there has almost never been a body of Christians that has been brought to the right track of all prophesying for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ. First Corinthians 14 gives a full description and even a charge for all to prophesy when the church comes together, but today there is not such a situation among the Lord&rsquo;s people. According to our study of the history of the church, there has almost never been such a thing. First Corinthians 14 surely should not be cut out of the Bible. The Lord told us that heaven and earth will pass away but His word will not pass away (Matt. 24:35). Every bit of the Lord&rsquo;s spoken word will be fulfilled. First Corinthians 14 will definitely be fulfilled. This is a great chapter in the divine revelation, showing that all of us need to pursue, desire earnestly, and seek to prophesy for the building up of the church. I have spent so much time to stress this one matter because this chapter has been neglected. This burden for all of us to prophesy is of the Lord for the building up of His organic Body.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL BELIEVERS BEING CHARGED BY THE APOSTLE<br />
TO PURSUE, TO DESIRE EARNESTLY,<br />
AND TO SEEK TO PROPHESY</h2>
<p>All the believers have been charged by the apostle to pursue, to desire earnestly, and to seek to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:1, 12, 39). In verse 1 is the word &ldquo;pursue.&rdquo; In verse 12 is the word &ldquo;seek.&rdquo; In verse 39 the words &ldquo;desire earnestly&rdquo; are used.</p>
<h2 class="head2">By Learning in the Word of God,<br />
in the Growth of Life,<br />
and in Their Contact with God</h2>
<p>We can pursue, desire earnestly, and seek to prophesy by learning (v. 31) in the Word of God, in the growth of life, and in our contact with God. First Corinthians 14:31 says that we can all prophesy one by one that all may learn. When we prophesy, others learn. This proves that before we prophesy, we have learned something. We are enabled to prophesy by learning.</p>
<p>At this point I would like to say a word of love to all of us. We have been chosen by God. We have been called by Him. We have been regenerated by Him and have become sons of God. We must spend sufficient time in the holy Word. We have to do it. We should not say that we do not have any time for this. As long as we have time to eat, we should have time to study the Word of God. Some saints had a proverb that said&mdash;&ldquo;No Bible, no breakfast.&rdquo; This proverb should always be in front of us. Perhaps we should even put it on our desk or hang it on our wall where we can see it every day&mdash;&ldquo;No Bible, no breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we desire to prophesy, we must learn the holy Word in the Bible. We must get ourselves fully acquainted with all the terms in the Bible. We need to be soaked in the holy Word so that we can be knowledgeable of the holy Word. In Luke 1 there is a record of the Lord&rsquo;s mother, Mary, visiting Elizabeth. Both of them prophesied to one another. Nearly every clause and every phrase of Mary&rsquo;s prophecy was a quotation from the Old Testament. This proves that Mary as a young woman was very knowledgeable of God&rsquo;s Word. We all have to learn the holy Word. If we do not have the holy Word, we do not have the expressions with which to speak. We may have the feeling and the inspiration within, but we will not have the utterances and the wording. All of us have to endeavor to learn the Word.</p>
<p>We also learn to prophesy in the growth of life. A person who has only been saved two months should not expect that he will be able to speak that much. In order to do things properly even in our human life, we have to grow. In the spiritual life it is the same. Spiritually speaking, we pass through stages of infancy, babyhood, childhood, teenage, and then we become a full-grown man. How much we can prophesy depends upon the degree of our growth in life. This is why we must seek the growth in the spiritual life.</p>
<p>We also learn to prophesy in our contact with God. We have to contact God, to fellowship with God. If we get into the Lord&rsquo;s Word, pursue the growth in life, and keep ourselves in contact with God, we will learn to prophesy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">By Being Perfected by the Prophets</h2>
<p>We are also enabled to prophesy by being perfected by the prophets (Eph. 4:12). There are some among us who can do the prophesying work. We should receive the perfecting from these ones. The gifted prophets among us should contact some of the dear saints. Then these saints can be perfected to prophesy. We all must have a new start in speaking for the Lord. The gifted ones among us can go to some promising saints to teach them to prophesy. After a number of weeks, a nucleus of saints can be perfected to prophesy by learning.</p>
<h2 class="head2">By Practicing to Speak in All the Meetings<br />
and to Tell People about Christ</h2>
<p>The saints need to be perfected and instructed, and they must put their instruction into practice. They need to practice by speaking in all the meetings. They should also tell people about Christ to practice prophesying.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE HIGHEST MEETINGS<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In order to practice 1 Corinthians 14, there is the need for the highest meetings of the church. To nourish and cherish the new believers, there is the need of mainly the home meetings. After a person believes in the Lord and is baptized, we need to go back to his home to have home meetings with him so that he can be fed and nourished. We need to be the nursing mothers, nourishing the new ones as our babes. To fellowship with, teach, and perfect the saints, there is the need of mainly the group meetings. The group meetings are a little bigger than the home meetings. A group meeting is a gathering of about twenty saints. In this meeting the saints can fellowship with one another, intercede for one another, and care for and shepherd one another. The teaching and perfecting of the saints also takes place in the group meetings. In these group meetings, everyone teaches, and everyone learns.</p>
<p>To build up the church by prophesying, we need the bigger and higher meetings of the church. The church meeting must be a prophesying meeting. We need to labor together in the Lord and with the Lord so that we can have church meetings in which we all come together to prophesy. If the number in the larger church meeting is too big, we can divide this meeting into sections. In Taipei these sections are called district meetings. Each district meeting has about fifty saints. We should not set up a rule in this matter. This is not a law, but is for the convenience of our practice.</p>
<p>For our present church life we need three kinds of meetings. We need the home meetings in the new believers&rsquo; homes to nourish and to cherish the new ones. We need the group meetings so that the saints can fellowship with one another, pray for one another, and take care of one another. In these group meetings, the saints can ask questions concerning the truth and concerning life, and everyone can answer these questions. Thus, in the group meetings everyone asks, everyone answers, everyone teaches, and everyone learns. After meeting in the group meetings in a regular way throughout the year, all the attendants will be taught with the truth and will be built up in life. Eventually, we will all reach the high peak of prophesying for the building up of the church. Prophesying is the highest attainment in our church life.</p>
<p>We may feel that it is too hard for us to enter into the fellowship in this book, but one day after our resurrection from the dead, we will go to Christ&rsquo;s judgment seat, and we will have to answer to Him (2 Cor. 5:10). Brother Nee wrote a hymn (not translated into English) that says for his life and for his work he is always under the light of the judgment seat of Christ. For today&rsquo;s life and today&rsquo;s work, we have to consider that day when we will stand before the judgment seat of Christ. We will be held accountable for what we have done and for what we have said. In Matthew 12:36 the Lord said, &ldquo;And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they shall render account concerning it in the day of judgment.&rdquo; Our idle words, including our gossip, will be checked at the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p>During the past four and a half years, I have reconsidered the entire Bible in relation to our practice. After so much reconsideration, I am burdened to present these four major items of the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today to the churches. I hope that we can spend a period of time to study the fellowship in this book with all the quotations and references of the Scripture. If we prayerfully consider the fellowship in this book, the Lord will speak to us, and this will revolutionize our concept concerning being a Christian, concerning the meetings, concerning the preaching of the gospel, and concerning Christian service. When the Lord recovers these four major items of the advance of His recovery today, that will be a big revolution to all of the Christians.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR NEED TO ENTER INTO THE BIBLICAL WAY</h2>
<p>We need to enter into the biblical way, and we need to see what this biblical way is. God chose His people in eternity past. Then in time He sent His servants to call out His chosen ones, who become gifts to His church. All of us are gifts to the Body. In our physical body, the shoulders and the thighs are gifts to our body. Without our shoulders and our thighs, our body cannot survive. But we have to realize that even our little finger is a gift to our body. We may appreciate our shoulder, but only our little finger can &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; our ear when we have an itch inside of it. We may feel that we are &ldquo;small potatoes&rdquo; in the church life, but I can testify that many times it was the &ldquo;small potatoes&rdquo; who came to me to comfort me. I am saying this to help us realize that all of us are gifts to the church, Christ&rsquo;s Body.</p>
<p>There are many gifted ones among us who have helped us by their speaking, but many times the speaking in the meeting that touches our heart is the speaking of the new ones. Many times when the new ones speak, it is like &ldquo;American dessert&rdquo; to me. It is so delicious and refreshing. The speaking of the older ones among us may seem common to us. However, the new ones, the new faces, and the new voices in the meeting always encourage us. All of us tend to get tired of seeing the same faces again and again. We like to see new faces, and we like to hear fresh voices telling us something new concerning our Lord.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s way is to have His people come together to have meetings of mutuality with all speaking for building up. According to the New Testament, the best time for this is on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Acts 20 records that Paul stayed in Troas for seven days, but it does not give a record of their meetings during those seven days. What it records is their meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day (vv. 6-12). On this day they had the Lord&rsquo;s table and a special time for the apostle&rsquo;s speaking and conversation with them. It is good for us to come together on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, and we need ministry meetings to receive the perfecting from certain gifted ones among us. But according to 1 Corinthians 14, the church meetings should be meetings of mutuality. It is not good for us to come together just to hear one man speaking to us again and again. We would become accustomed to his voice, his gestures, and his other characteristics. Eventually, we would become bored of the same person speaking to us again and again. This is not God&rsquo;s ordained way for the meetings of the church. God&rsquo;s ordained way is that His people should come together and prophesy one by one.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has been exercised to take the biblical way, God&rsquo;s ordained way. They have about five thousand saints meeting every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. They discovered that if all five thousand came together in a big hall, eventually the number of those attending the meeting would be reduced. Therefore, they divided these five thousand into over one hundred thirty sections. Each section has about forty to fifty saints. They call these sections &ldquo;district meetings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has been in existence for forty years. A number of saints in the church in Taipei have been there from its very beginning in 1949. They were accustomed to meeting every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning with one brother speaking and the rest listening. They love the Lord and are steadfast and faithful, but none of them was accustomed to meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day with all prophesying. At the beginning of our practicing to divide into district meetings for the universal prophesying, it was not so easy. Of course, anything new is difficult, but gradually after a few months, all the saints became used to this way of meeting.</p>
<p>In these meetings the saints practice prophesying one by one. They limit the time of each one&rsquo;s sharing to not more than three minutes. They all know this principle of three minutes and practice to keep it. In the district meetings, they first have the Lord&rsquo;s table, and then they prophesy for about sixty minutes. Within sixty minutes twenty persons can speak with a maximum time of three minutes per person. About one-third of the attendants prophesy in the district meetings without any prior arrangement or program. They all come together and follow the Spirit to prophesy. As they practice prophesying again and again, they are progressing, advancing. They have learned how to prophesy. They also have some brothers who act as coaches or tutors to coach and tutor the saints before they come to the meeting. This helps a great deal. To coach and to tutor the saints is one of the best ways to perfect the saints to prophesy.</p>
<p>We all have to be students learning to prophesy. We are in the New Testament age, living according to the New Testament principle of incarnation. Incarnation means that whatever God does, He does it with man&rsquo;s cooperation. In the New Testament, God does not do things by Himself apart from man. The Old Testament tells us that the Spirit fell upon certain people and they prophesied. In the New Testament, there is not such a record. In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul said that what he spoke was according to his opinion. Then he concluded by saying, &ldquo;But I think that I also have the Spirit of God&rdquo; (v. 40). Even though Paul said that his speaking was his opinion, his opinion became a part of the Bible. This indicates the New Testament principle of incarnation, the principle of God and man, man and God, becoming one. Paul&rsquo;s speaking in 1 Corinthians 7 is different from the Pentecostal way of praying, fasting, and waiting on the Lord until something falls upon us from the heavens. In 1 Corinthians 7:25 Paul said that he had no commandment of the Lord, but he gave his opinion as one who had received mercy of the Lord to be faithful. When Paul spoke this word, however, the very processed Triune God was speaking in him and with him.</p>
<p>For us to prophesy we do not have to pray for three days so that something from the heavens will fall upon us. We need to contact the Lord from morning to evening by calling on Him&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Whenever we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we have the sensation that Someone is with us. If we were to call other names, we would not have this sensation because there would be no response. But when we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; again and again, we have a sweet sensation within us of a living person. We can call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; at any time and in any place. While we are washing our face, we can call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; When we call, we have an inward sensation of sweetness. When we call all day long from morning to evening, we are one with the Lord in a practical way. By this we can realize and experience the fact of being one spirit with Him. As such people who live a prophesying life, our speaking will have the indwelling Spirit as its contents.</p>
<p>In addition to living a prophesying life, we also need to learn to speak for the Lord. Regardless of how much a person loves the Lord, he cannot prophesy properly unless he learns the &ldquo;language&rdquo; of prophesying. He must learn the language in order to cooperate with the indwelling Spirit to prophesy. In Matthew 25 the Lord indicated that He gave talents to His slaves according to their ability. If they had not had the ability, there would have been no basis for the Lord to give them the talents. Human ability is constituted by a person&rsquo;s birth according to God&rsquo;s creation. God&rsquo;s creation plus human learning builds up an ability which is a base for the Lord, the saving One, to give us the spiritual talent, the gift. The prophesying gift is constituted by our ability which is according to God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>A brother may be created by God with a smart mind and with eloquent speaking ability. He is smart and eloquent in speaking because God created him that way. He has such a base to enable him to prophesy. As this brother loves the Lord and fellowships with Him, the Lord will come in to become his spiritual talent, and this will become a gift to enable him to prophesy. He still needs to advance by learning in the Word so that he can quote the Word. He needs to get himself soaked in the Word, to become fully familiar with all the biblical phrases and clauses. He also needs to endeavor to live in the presence of the Lord and to keep himself in a condition of not having any obstacle between him and his Lord. We should sing the hymn &ldquo;Nothing Between, Lord, Nothing Between&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #373). We should have a direct contact with the Lord, and His presence should be so clear to us. Between Him and us there should be nothing as a veil or as a kind of darkness. We need to be so much in the light. We need to be persons who know the Word and who have the experience of life. If we are such persons, we can prophesy in any kind of meeting. If we all live such a prophesying life, all of us will be able to speak something for the Lord when we come together.</p>
<p>If each one speaks three minutes or less, twenty to thirty will have the chance to speak. No one man can replace the riches of these twenty or thirty brothers and sisters. Their speaking will be an exhibition of the riches of Christ. The next week thirty more may speak, and fifteen of them will be ones who did not prophesy the previous week. Therefore, every Lord&rsquo;s Day there will be twenty to thirty speaking, with new saints speaking each week. The many voices of the different saints will never cause people to be bored. A person who speaks a message can only cover a limited number of points. With thirty people speaking, there can be thirty points.</p>
<p>Suppose that the meeting begins with a new one prophesying. He may say, &ldquo;I have only been saved about three months. I do not know what to say, but I can tell you from my experience that the Lord Jesus surely is lovable. He&rsquo;s so sweet, and He is real in my daily life.&rdquo; Such a short prophesying by one new believer would encourage all of us. To practice the universal prophesying in the church meetings is the way to release all the riches stored in all the members of the Body of Christ. Even the new believers have a little storage of the riches of Christ. When a new believer shares the riches he has, this becomes the opener to open up all the attendants to release the riches of Christ stored within them.</p>
<p>In this scriptural way of meeting, we will discover who the gifted persons are among us. This scriptural way discovers the gifted persons among us who can not only prophesy in the church meetings but also perfect others to prophesy. According to the New Testament, the Lord has given particular gifts to the churches. These particular gifts have their particular work and their particular usefulness like the Apostle Paul.</p>
<p>When we have the church meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, everyone comes to prophesy. It seems that we have not given the chance or the time for the gifted persons to function. Then we may feel that the gifted persons have become useless or jobless. These gifted persons, however, will not be unemployed. I expect that all the local churches will practice the new way to such an extent that every month the church will have a weekend conference. We can have a weekend conference of three days each month of the year. This can be a special conference for the gifted persons to function for the reaping of the new ones and the perfecting of the saints.</p>
<p>During each month, all the dear saints can practice the priesthood of the New Testament gospel by going out to visit people. They can visit their relatives, friends, and classmates. If we have one hundred fifty meeting together, at least one-third can go out to visit people. When we visit people for the gospel, we do not have that much time to give them an adequate knowledge of the gospel truths. What shall we do? The church is rich. It does not only have many members who can go out to visit people but it also has at least two evangelists. We can set up a gospel preaching and reaping meeting every month for these two evangelists to speak to the audience. We can all bring our new contacts to this meeting. If fifty saints can visit people for one month, we can have at least fifty new ones in this meeting. Actually, these new ones are not so new. They may have already been saved and baptized, but they need to hear a series of messages on the Christian faith from these two evangelists. If they hear three long messages along this line, this will confirm them very much. They have all believed in the Lord Jesus, but they really do not know what the real Christian faith is. After hearing three messages on the Christian faith, they will be established.</p>
<p>All the saints should go out to visit people to get the people ready. At the end of the month, we can have a gospel reaping conference to reap all these ones. Then the next month we can have a conference so that the gifted persons like the prophets and teachers can function to give messages on a certain vision. Suppose that year-round, we had a gospel reaping meeting every other month, and we also had some messages every other month to release something of God&rsquo;s revelation. If we practice in this way, we will see the riches released through the members of the Body</p>
<p>Some of the dear saints misunderstand the new way. Some of the older saints may feel that they have become useless and put aside. This is absolutely wrong. If a family is going to flourish, it must have aggressive young people. The young people must be aggressive in studying to get a degree and to enter into some enterprise. When the young ones get some new knowledge, they may not be so happy with their older parents because they are so conservative. Because the parents do not understand computers, they may not want to use them. The young ones should not be bothered by their parents&rsquo; attitude toward computers. They need to remember who their parents are. If their parents say something, they say it with a good heart. It is good for the young people to be aggressive in the new way, but they need to be careful. Otherwise, they will be like someone driving a truck without a brake. A big truck without a brake is dangerous. On the one hand, the young people need to be aggressive to pick up all the new concepts and practices of the new way. On the other hand, they need to be cautious.</p>
<p>I have no intention of not using the old ones. I love the old ones. How wonderful it is to have fathers in the church life! How lovely it is for a father to say to a son, &ldquo;Son, how is your work going? Remember not to go too fast.&rdquo; It should make us happy to have our father living with us. All the riches are here in the church life. We have the saints who can visit people to preach the gospel, doing the work of the New Testament priesthood. We also have the gifted persons such as the evangelists who can give messages concerning items of the truth such as Christ&rsquo;s redemption, the objective justification by faith, and the subjective justification by life. In the church we can have many young people going out with a burning spirit, and we can also have some older ones as the gifts who can teach the gospel truths to the uttermost. What a display of the riches in the Body! Everyone will be occupied in the new way. No one will have the chance to be idle.</p>
<p>Today, generally speaking, only a minority of the saints are doing the priestly service. Other saints do practical work such as vacuuming and cleaning; this work is Levitical work. When we all get brought into the scriptural way, however, all will be functioning as priests. Some will go out to visit people for gospel preaching; some will go out to the homes to feed the young ones; some will go to have group meetings; and some will endeavor for the whole week to learn how to prophesy for the coming Lord&rsquo;s Day. They will spend the whole week to prepare a prophecy of three minutes to speak in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting.</p>
<p>When we take this way, the saints will be developed to the uttermost, and more chances will be created for the riches of Christ to be released. This scriptural way will produce many, many gifted persons. Among one hundred fifty saints meeting together, there may be quite a few who are gifted persons. These gifted persons need to be discovered. They need to be developed and built up. If we practice the biblical way as ordained by God, all the gifts will come to the surface. Whatever we have among us will be manifested, the gifts among us will also be manifested, and the saints will be perfected. Many new ones will be brought in, and they will be fed, taught, and perfected. They will be our second generation to do the same work that we have done. Then we will have a third generation and a fourth generation. The church will be built up in this way. A society is built up in a similar way. It is not built up by mass propagation. The many families in society each bear children, and the society is built up.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s way is higher than our way. He is much wiser than we are. Why should we follow the human-made way and not pick up the God-ordained way? We need to come back to the &ldquo;ordained map&rdquo; and follow the Lord according to this map. Then we will see His blessing. We are not so much blessed because we are not fully on His ordained way. In a certain sense, we are not obedient to Him. We behave ourselves according to our understanding and according to our choice.</p>
<p>In practicing the new way, we need the Lord&rsquo;s help to practice with patience. I believe that at least one-third of the saints will be able to carry out the four major points of the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. These saints can participate in the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament, the organic building up of the Body of Christ, the perfecting of the saints by the gifts, and the prophesying for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ. Then all the saints among us will be occupied by a certain item of the New Testament service as ordained by God. Whatever we do in the God-ordained way will be very fruitful. People will be saved and brought in by us. These ones will be raised up by us and will be perfected. All the gifts, the talents, the abilities, and the capacities among us will be exposed and manifested in our meetings, and the gifted persons will be produced. This will take place among us in a gradual way. We must take God&rsquo;s ordained way according to His holy Word.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO CARRY OUT<br />
THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD<br />
OF THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S UP-TO-DATE RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-6; 19:1-6, 9-10; John 4:3-7; 1 Pet. 2:5; 2 Tim. 4:2; 1 Cor. 9:22-23; Acts 5:42; John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; Rom. 12:1; Heb. 10:24-25</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see how to carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel according to the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date recovery. In order to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we have to take care of four steps. Each step is a must. The first step is to get sinners saved to make them members of the living Christ. In other words, we have to preach the gospel as New Testament priests. The second step is to have home meetings, not in our homes but in the homes of the new ones for the purpose of nourishing and cherishing them. In our preaching of the gospel, we surely will beget new babes. Therefore, we must continue to take care of them by nourishing and cherishing them as nursing mothers. The third step is to bring these new ones into the group meetings. The group meetings will have the fellowship, the interceding, the mutual care, the shepherding, and the mutual teaching. This will spontaneously perfect these new ones, carrying out the perfecting of the saints revealed in Ephesians 4:11-12. The fourth step, as a result of such perfecting, is to usher these ones into prophesying. In other words, we have to perfect them to such an extent and to such a level that they can speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord to minister and dispense Christ into others. This is the top point for building up the organic Body of Christ, and this will fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal plan according to His divine economy. These four steps will give the Lord a way to accomplish what He is after.</p>
<p>I would summarize these four steps respectively with four words: <em>go, feed, perfect,</em> and <em>climb</em>. To carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel we have to go, feed, perfect, and climb. To lead and to usher all the new ones into prophesying is really to climb a high peak. It is not so easy to do this, so we have to climb. Paul&rsquo;s desire in 1 Corinthians 14 is not just for the gifted persons as prophets to prophesy but for every common believer to prophesy. Based on this revelation of the way to carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we all have to realize that in the past years, we Christians have wasted much of our time, our energy, and our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">UPROOTING THE OLD WAY<br />
AND PLANTING THE NEW WAY,<br />
WHICH GIVES THE BELIEVERS<br />
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO FUNCTION<br />
AS THE ORGANIC MEMBERS<br />
OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Last year the leaders of a denomination in the United States had a conference to fellowship about the burden to evangelize the entire globe by the year 2000. The conclusion of that conference was that they were short of manpower, despite their having many millions of members in the United States. This example shows that most of the Christians&rsquo; functions have been annulled. All of them have been disabled by the wrong practice of today&rsquo;s Christianity. Christianity for the past centuries did a marvelous job in gaining millions of people for Christ, but at the same time their practice annulled the functioning of those whom they gained.</p>
<p>After a babe is born, this little babe normally has all the organs necessary for it to function properly. A newborn babe has a listening organ, a speaking organ, and a seeing organ, but all these organs need years to develop. Eventually, this babe will become a full-grown person who is fully and normally functioning. Because all his organs and members have been exercised, he can see, hear, speak, smell, walk, and do many other things. If infants were not allowed to use their eyes for a long period of time, they would become blind. Their eyesight would become useless because the capacity, the ability, of their seeing organ would have never been developed.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Christianity gained millions of believers, but on the other hand, the practice of Christianity killed their function because it took away every chance for their development. Nearly all the chances are given to a small number who are educated in seminary or some kind of theological school. This practice produces a clergy, and this clergy builds up a hierarchy, leaving all the common Christians as the laity without any chance to practice so that their functions can develop. The United States is a top nation because it affords opportunities to everybody. In the church life, everyone should have equal opportunity. The practice of Christianity does not give the believers equal opportunity to function as the organic members of the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, a local church should have elders, but these elders are not a clerical class. The elders are the overseers (Acts 20:17, 28), which the King James Version refers to as bishops. Ignatius in the second century taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder. From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the Pope in the Roman Catholic Church. This erroneous teaching is also the source of the episcopal system of church government. As the overseers, the elders are leading ones. Every overseer is a leader. If this were not the case, the churches would be in a state of anarchy because there would be no leadership.</p>
<p>In Peter&rsquo;s first Epistle, he says that the church is God&rsquo;s possession and that God has allotted His possession to the elders (5:2-3). The churches are allotted to the elders as their allotments, their portions, entrusted to them by God for their care. The elders are the &ldquo;keepers&rdquo; who look after God&rsquo;s possession. Although they are the leaders, Peter charged the elders not to lord it over the allotments. The elders should not be the lords to lord it over the churches. Instead, the elders should shepherd the flock of God. The elders in the church can only take the leadership (not the lordship), which all the believers should honor and follow (1 Thes. 5:12-13; 1 Tim. 5:17).</p>
<p>The function of the elders in the churches is absolutely necessary, but equal opportunity should be afforded to all the saints to speak in the meetings, to preach the gospel, to feed the new ones, to take care of the young ones, to perfect the saints, etc. In all things, opportunities should be afforded to each one of the saints equally. The United States is a top country because of its policy of equal opportunity. Furthermore, the United States endeavors to have a situation in which every citizen is working and producing.</p>
<p>To do something properly, a person needs a basic education. For someone to become a carpenter, he should finish his high school education and also learn the trade of carpentry. If a person is going to be a barber, he should finish his high school education and learn the trade of a barber. In the United States, everyone has an opportunity to receive an education. A high school education is even considered as a kind of compulsory education. Because of this, the United States is a strong country. Are the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery like this? Is everyone equal in everything?</p>
<p>Fifty-seven years ago, a church was established in my hometown, and I was a leading one there. Since that time I have seen many things. I have participated in the leadership throughout these fifty-seven years. According to my observation and understanding, I have not seen a church among us that has given equal opportunities to every member. Since I have been involved in the leadership in the churches, some may wonder why I did not give the saints equal opportunities in the churches where I labored. I did not have the intention of not giving equal opportunities to all the saints, but the system of our practice did not allow me to do this. In the way that we practiced the church life, there was no possibility for us to afford equal opportunities to all the saints. This is because the way was wrong.</p>
<p>To illustrate this matter of having a wrong system, we can consider two systems of government. People may talk about democracy, but their political system may be one of autocracy. If the system of government is autocracy, how can they exercise democracy? This is impossible. How can things be done democratically in a country of autocracy? If the people in that country want to practice democracy, they have to uproot their autocratic system and plant a new system, a system of democracy. Then their country will be a democratic country in which they can practice democracy. In order to practice democracy, the principle and the system of government need to be completely changed to a democratic system. Likewise, in order to carry out the New Testament priesthood, we need to uproot our &ldquo;autocratic&rdquo; way, our old way.</p>
<p>Our preaching of the gospel in the past is an illustration of an old system that did not bring all the saints into the preaching of the gospel. At a certain time, the elders would arrange to have either a gospel preaching meeting or a conference. Then they would appoint one good speaker who could be considered as an evangelist. Perhaps a number of people were brought to these meetings by the saints, and through these meetings a number were saved and baptized. No one can criticize this. The problem is that this practice became our system of gospel preaching. After this gospel preaching meeting or conference, most of the saints did not go on to carry out the preaching of the gospel in their daily life. Preaching the gospel has become an optional matter with many of the saints.</p>
<p>Furthermore, instead of the saints paying an adequate amount of attention to the preaching of the gospel in their daily life, they paid their attention to when the next gospel preaching meeting would take place. A brother may have said to his wife, &ldquo;Do you know when the church will have another gospel preaching meeting? I am very burdened for my old schoolmate. I feel I owe him something. When we have our next gospel preaching meeting, I will bring him to get him saved.&rdquo; This was our practice in the past. Unconsciously, it had become the system of our gospel preaching. To preach the gospel by any means is right, but in what kind of system are we preaching the gospel? What we do may be right, but the system in which we do it may be altogether wrong.</p>
<p>The traditional way of preaching the gospel, the old way, &ldquo;drugs&rdquo; the minds of the believers concerning the preaching of the gospel. Most believers do not have the consideration that the preaching of the gospel must be every believer&rsquo;s obligation. Preaching the gospel is not just a matter of having periodic big meetings. The preaching of the gospel is a daily matter in the daily life of the believers. Therefore, the system of having only big gospel preaching meetings is altogether wrong. I do not mean that having big meetings for gospel preaching is wrong, but the system has to be uprooted. We have to plant another system in which every saint is a New Testament priest to carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.</p>
<p>We may have preached the gospel in the past without having the thought that we have to be priests in order to preach the gospel. The preaching of the gospel is not done by an ordinary person but by a priest. A priest is a particular person. He is one who is very close to God, who contacts God moment by moment. Such a person is one with God, and he receives God&rsquo;s word so that he can speak God out to others. He can bring God to man, and he can bring man to God. He has to bring God to his close relatives, to his neighbors, to his colleagues, and to all men.</p>
<p>Because we are priests, we have to have something to offer to God. A priest is one who offers sacrifices to God. The main sacrifices that a New Testament priest offers to God are not his praises or good works. The main sacrifices he offers to God are living persons, sinners who have been regenerated to become members of the living Christ (1 Pet. 2:5; Rom. 15:16). In the eyes of God, these regenerated sinners are living sacrifices, spiritual sacrifices. As the New Testament priests, we have to offer these sacrifices to God. How can we gain these sacrifices? Should we just wait until the church makes a decision to have a big gospel preaching meeting? That meeting will result in the offering of some sacrifices, but all these sacrifices will be offered up by only one or two brothers. Eventually, the rest of us only have a portion in a Levitical service. We are not functioning as priests, but the brother who speaks becomes the unique priest. Therefore, there is no equality. All the &ldquo;laymen&rdquo; among us need to be emancipated. I am doing my best to emancipate all the saints.</p><h2 class="head1">GETTING SINNERS SAVED<br />
THROUGH OUR PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL<br />
BY VISITING THEM IN THEIR HOMES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Making the New Testament Priesthood<br />
of the Gospel a Part of Our Daily Life</h2>
<p>To carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we first must get sinners saved through our preaching of the gospel by visiting them in their homes (Luke 10:1-6; 19:1-6, 9-10; John 4:3-7). We need to make the New Testament priesthood of the gospel a part of our daily life. To get sinners saved is the work and the life of a priest. We have to save sinners and offer them to God as spiritual sacrifices (1 Pet. 2:5) habitually, regularly, and constantly (2 Tim. 4:2; 1 Cor. 9:22-23). This must be our habit. Just as we take three meals a day regularly, we have to preach the gospel regularly and constantly. As the New Testament priests, we are also the branches of the vine-tree, Christ (John 15:5). The purpose of the branches is to bear fruit. If we are not bearing fruit, this is evidence that we are not abiding in the vine. As branches of the vine, we need to bear fruit for the glorification of the Father (John 15:8), and as priests, we have to gain new ones, offering them to God as spiritual sacrifices.</p>
<p>To have living and spiritual sacrifices to offer to God for His acceptance, we must go to the human &ldquo;ocean.&rdquo; The Lord told Peter that He would make him a fisher of men (Matt. 4:18-19). All of us need to go to fish for men. We need to go where the fish are. Instead of going fishing, we may send out invitations, spreading them in the &ldquo;ocean&rdquo; and asking the &ldquo;fish&rdquo; to come to our gospel preaching meeting. Instead of going to the fish, we invite the fish to come to us. It is not logical for us to labor in this way. We have to go where the fish are.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was the first fisherman. He did not sit on the throne in the heavens and ask the fish to come to Him. Instead, He left His throne in the heavens and came to be a man so that He could visit man. He came to be a man according to God&rsquo;s ordained New Testament principle of incarnation. As the almighty God, He entered into the womb of a human virgin, staying there for nine months. This is the process that He passed through so that He could come to preach the gospel to us. He was born with two natures, divine and human. He became a God-man to live God and to express God. This God-man lived in Nazareth for approximately thirty years, seemingly not doing anything. He passed through such a marvelous human living in order to be completed. At the age of thirty, He began His ministry. He did not build a big meeting hall or a big cathedral and send out invitations inviting people to come to hear Him speak. As a humble Nazarene without a reputation or a degree, He visited village after village. People wondered how He learned so much and how He could speak in the way that He did.</p>
<p>Visiting people for the preaching of the gospel is God&rsquo;s ordained way, and this is also the way practiced by the Lord Jesus. The Lord came down from heaven to save sinners (1 Tim. 1:15). He went to visit Zaccheus with His dynamic salvation (Luke 19:1-10). He entered the home of Zaccheus and stayed in his house, bringing Zaccheus to salvation. He went to visit the Samaritan woman and bring her the living water (John 4:3-15). He went purposely from Judea to Samaria and sat by a well, waiting for this woman to come to draw water. His visiting this woman was His &ldquo;knocking on doors.&rdquo; The essence of knocking on doors is to meet people where they are. Zaccheus was a sinful tax collector, and the Samaritan woman was an immoral woman. The Lord visited both of them to bring salvation to them. This should be our pattern. We have to go to visit people.</p>
<p>The Lord also sent His disciples to people. He sent the twelve to go to the cities and villages to visit the lost sheep of the house of Israel and bring them peace (Matt. 10:5-8, 11-13). Then he sent the seventy to go to every city and seek the sons of peace (Luke 10:1-6), whom God the Father had chosen in eternity past. The Lord Jesus told us that we would be as lambs in the midst of wolves (v. 3). This means that we have to sacrifice ourselves. In order to carry out the priesthood of the gospel, we have to go to the wolves because among the wolves there are some sons of peace. The sons of peace that we gain will one day welcome us into the eternal tabernacles (Luke 16:9). Today it should be easy for us to visit people. We can go to visit our close relatives first, and then we can visit our neighbors, friends, and classmates.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Always Having Two or Three<br />
Newly Baptized Ones under Our Care Year-round</h2>
<p>We should always have two or three newly baptized ones under our care year-round. We should not bring forth too many new ones because we will not be able to care for all of them. In a good sense, we have to exercise &ldquo;birth control.&rdquo; One brother said that he had a good month in the gospel because he baptized twelve people. However, to have twelve infants to care for will burden a person beyond what he is able to bear. If a mother had twelve deliveries within one month, this would be a misfortune to her. When we get two or three baptized, we need to stop producing more new ones in order to care for these two or three. If we take care of them, they will grow in life properly.</p>
<p>We have to carry out the preaching of the gospel in the new way by controlling the rate of birth. Humanly speaking, we tend to be at one extreme or the other. On the one extreme, we may not go to preach the gospel, saying that it is too difficult to visit people by knocking on their doors. After three months, however, we may get excited and go out to knock on doors to get twelve baptized in one month. We have to be balanced. We need to go out to preach the gospel in a regular way, but we also need to exercise to control the new births. If we get three baptisms in the first week, we should stop and go back to the baptized ones twice a week to nourish and cherish them. We need to go back to them in a sober way with much prayer and fellowship with the Lord to help them by feeding them. Nursing mothers know that they need to feed the babes a little bit at a time. If each one of us brought forth two new ones yearly, the increase in the churches would be very good.</p>
<p>After the delivery of her first child, a mother learns how to feed the newly delivered babe. In the past, we may not have known how to feed a new one properly. We did not know how to talk with the newly baptized ones. We were not trained to talk in a proper way to feed the young ones. I would beg all of us to put our old way aside. After we preach the gospel to some and they get saved, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, how should I go to these new ones? In what way can I feed them properly?&rdquo; We need to pray to the Lord concerning our care for the new ones. We should not exercise our knowledge. We may have been in the church for fifteen years, and we may think that we know nearly everything. However, we must learn to know nothing. The new way is the organic way. We have to learn how to feed the new ones organically.</p>
<p>If you are visiting a new sister whose husband persecutes her, how are you going to feed her? What are you going to say? You must pray and learn. A sister may be burdened to preach the gospel to her grandfather. If she went to her grandfather to tell him doctrinal things, she would fail. If she prays and opens herself to the Lord, she may go to her grandfather with tears and say, &ldquo;Dear grandfather, I owe you something. I have been saved for many years, but I have never talked to you about the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Even without speaking about the Lord yet, this sister&rsquo;s grandfather would be touched by the Lord. Her speaking would open him up to receive the Lord. We have to learn to pray to the Lord and to seek the very anointing of the Spirit. Then we can go to speak a word of life. This kind of speaking is the organic feeding.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you what to say, but I can tell you that the way is to pray, forgetting about what you know. What you know means nothing. That does not work. You must pray to get the instant feeling of the anointing, to get the instant, new utterances to say something to the ones whom you are going to visit. Then what you say will be organic and living. You do not need to talk too much. Perhaps twenty minutes is enough. Furthermore, do not try to solve their problems. Since you yourself have many problems that have not been solved, how can you solve others&rsquo; problems? You may tell a new one, &ldquo;I cannot solve your problem because I may have more problems than you do.&rdquo; This new one may ask you what you do. You can tell him, &ldquo;I can do nothing except pray to the living Lord.&rdquo; This word is an organic feeding. After you leave, this new one may pray immediately. This is evidence that the new one was fed by you. To feed someone does not mean that you have to give him a lecture, a message, a doctrine, or even a small booklet. We should not depend on all these things. We must learn how to be organic. We ourselves have to be organic.</p>
<p>The way to organically build up the Body of Christ begins with visiting people where they are to get them saved through our preaching of the gospel. Then we need to go back to the new believers and feed them. To feed them, to nourish them, is to cause them to grow, and to cause them to grow is to build them up. After a newborn babe is delivered, the mother continually feeds him, and this feeding causes him to grow. His growth is his organic building up. If we visit the new ones, but do not minister Christ to them, this will cause them to starve, so there will be no growth, no building up. When we go back to visit the newly baptized ones, we need to feed them with the milk of the word. First Peter 2:2 says that the newborn babes should long for the milk of the word that they may grow. If we visit them regularly and feed them with the milk of the word, they will grow, and by their growth they will be built up and established in the Christian faith.</p>
<p>We have to meet with the new ones in their homes regularly until they become established in the faith (Acts 5:42). After six months of continual care, they may be settled in their faith. Until they are settled in their faith, we should not stop going to them. To feed them is to feed the Lord&rsquo;s lambs (John 21:15). In John 21 the Lord Jesus asked Peter if he loved Him. When Peter said that he did, the Lord charged him to feed His lambs. To feed the lambs is to feed the infants, the little ones. Such a top apostle as Peter was charged by the Lord to be a nursing mother to feed the small lambs.</p>
<p>According to 1 Thessalonians 2:7, we need to nourish and cherish the new ones as nursing mothers. To cherish is to nurture with tender love and foster with tender care. To cherish a new one is to make him comfortable and happy. When a mother cherishes an infant by putting it into her bosom, she makes the infant happy and comfortable. In such a cherishing atmosphere, the little one can be nourished. We must learn how to cherish the new ones to make them happy and comfortable.</p>
<p>We also have to bring them up and lead them to present themselves to God as living sacrifices, according to the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s charge in Romans 12:1. After a child is nourished for a period of time, he becomes a teenager. Once we have nourished and cherished the new ones for a period of time so that they can grow to become &ldquo;teenagers,&rdquo; we need to lead them to present themselves to God as living sacrifices. At the time of their conversion, we offered them to God as spiritual sacrifices. After feeding them for a period of time, we have to lead them, to beg them, and to help them offer themselves to God as living sacrifices. Paul&rsquo;s speaking in the book of Romans is progressive according to the maturity of life. By the time he comes to chapter twelve, the believers who were babes have become teenagers. Therefore, in Romans 12 there is the Body life in which all the members function. Some prophesy and others teach (vv. 6-7). This Body life can be experienced in the home meetings with the new beginners. We need to bring the new ones into the experience of Romans 12:1.</p><h2 class="head1">BRINGING THE NEW BELIEVERS UNDER OUR CARE<br />
TO THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We also need to bring the believers under our care to the group meetings. When we bring them to the group meetings, spontaneously they will participate in the fellowship, interceding, and mutual care with the saints. In these group meetings, we can incite one another to love and good works, exhorting one another (Heb. 10:24-25). In Hebrews 10:25 Paul said that we should not forsake the assembling of <em>ourselves</em> together. This means that we should not forsake our own meetings. The group meetings are our meetings. They are very intimate.</p>
<p>Among all the meetings in the church life, no other meeting is as intimate, as practical, and as all-inclusive as the group meeting. It includes fellowship, interceding, mutual care, and shepherding. If a local church grows to about two hundred saints, five elders cannot shepherd all the saints. It is impossible for them to do this. The practical shepherding in the church life is taken care of by the group meetings. In the group meetings, the saints know one another, and they can help one another mutually. This mutual help is a kind of shepherding.</p>
<p>In Christianity, group meetings are very rare. Some hold the concept that the big congregation can be divided into groups, making every group a worshipping group of believers. But when they come together, they come together with the understanding that they need to worship God in a traditional and religious way. In their traditional worship, they are accustomed to a pastor directing the meeting. Thus, when they come together in a group, no one knows what to do. Among us we do not like to use the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; for our meetings, but we may come to the group meetings with the concept that we should have a traditional service. When we have a group meeting in a traditional way without the Spirit and without life, everyone will be disappointed.</p>
<p>We should not have our group meeting in the way of a traditional worship service. I would like to illustrate what I mean by this. The elders might announce that a certain night is a night for all of us to have group meetings. A brother may say to his wife, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that tonight at 7:30 there is a group meeting. You better prepare the meal a little earlier so that I can go.&rdquo; Because the wife cannot go to the meeting with him, this brother goes by himself to the group meeting with his Bible and hymnal. He arrives a little early at the home in which the meeting is to be held. The brother then sits there and waits for someone else to come. A sister may then come. Because this brother does not know the sister that well, they do not talk to one another, and they wait for someone else to come. Another brother then comes in. Now it is 7:35, and the three of them are still waiting for the meeting to begin.</p>
<p>Eventually, one of the elders comes in at 7:40. Then the elder gets bothered because so few of the saints are there and the meeting has not started yet. As one of the elders, he feels that he must do something, so he asks the saints to start the meeting by singing a hymn. By that time another elder comes in. The first elder feels good that one of his helpers is there. After singing the hymn, the first elder looks at the second elder, signaling to him that he should pray. After the second elder prays, he looks at the first elder, indicating that he should speak something. But the first elder looks back at the second elder, indicating to him that he needs to speak. Eventually, the first elder says to the saints, &ldquo;Tonight we are on the <em>Truth Lessons</em>. Last week we were on lesson four. Tonight let us go on to lesson five.&rdquo; We may consider that this is a group meeting, but this is Christian service and Christian worship in a traditional, inorganic way.</p>
<p>When we first proposed to have the group meetings, nearly all the churches had the group meetings in a traditional way. The group meetings were carried out as a traditional, Christian service. In this traditional way of having a group meeting, the saints do not release what is on their hearts. Instead, they practice a Christian service according to a program. First there is a hymn, then singing, then prayer, and finally the lesson. What is on our heart is never released. Therefore, we just perform in the meeting. What we do is not genuine, and we become performers, the players in a drama. After such a meeting, everyone feels that we merely had a service. This kind of meeting just tires people out. The saints may not even want to return to such a meeting because there is very little enjoyment and hardly anything genuine there.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the proper way to have a group meeting. On the day of the group meeting, a brother in that meeting begins his day with the Lord in the morning. Throughout the day he practices to be one with the Lord, to live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, by calling on His name and by singing. When he returns home, he may even sing a little bit during dinner and after dinner. He may sing in a wrong way with the wrong melody, but the more he sings the happier he is. Then after dinner he tells his wife that he is going to the meeting. He goes to the meeting singing. While he is driving to the meeting, he is still singing, and at a certain point he stops singing to pray. Actually, the meeting has already started in the home of this brother. He did not go to the meeting to attend the meeting, but he brought the meeting into the meeting place.</p>
<p>This brother was the first to arrive at the meeting place, but he did not stop the meeting. He continued to pray. While he was praying, a sister came in and joined his prayer. Then a third one came in and spoke something concerning his enjoyment of the Lord. This is a real group meeting. The speaking is in a conversational way and in a spontaneous and natural way. As the saints begin to fellowship with one another, some prayers are made, and these prayers are interceding prayers. Out of this interceding prayer the care for one another is realized.</p>
<p>In this kind of meeting there is no set program, but things are brought out according to the needs of the saints. A young sister in the meeting may say, &ldquo;I was saved only two months ago. I heard some of you talking a lot about circumcision. What is circumcision?&rdquo; After this sister asks this question, everyone has the opportunity to answer it. If one brother knows more, he can answer more. If another one knows less, he can answer less. Regardless of how much someone answers the question, whatever he answers is a teaching to all the attendants. One young brother may say, &ldquo;Two months ago I got to know that circumcision was practiced from the time of Abraham, and the Jews continued to practice this.&rdquo; This is a short teaching from this young brother that renders some help. Then another older saint can say: &ldquo;Circumcision was a type of a spiritual reality. Circumcision is to cut off the flesh. It is a type of the cross of Christ. The cross of Christ cut off, crossed out, our flesh.&rdquo; Another brother can continue by saying, &ldquo;Today this kind of circumcision by the cross of Christ is applied by the Spirit within us. When we are in the spirit, the Spirit of Christ applies the cross of Christ to our flesh.&rdquo; In just a short time, the young sister&rsquo;s question has been answered. This answer from the saints releases a very good teaching, which is received by the attendants in the meeting.</p>
<p>We should not appoint someone to be a leader to take the lead in the meeting. Actually, however, there is a leader in the meeting who is taking care of it. Suppose that a question is asked regarding circumcision and only one young brother says that all he knows is that this practice was exercised from the time of Abraham. If no one says anything else, this is a loss to the meeting. There must be someone taking care of this meeting &ldquo;underneath.&rdquo; There must be such a person in the meeting who can say that circumcision was a type of the cross of Christ, and today the cross of Christ as our circumcision can only be applied and experienced by us in the spirit. Apparently, though, this person is not the leader. Sometimes in order to teach others, he would ask a question and let the others answer. This kind of meeting is a Christian fellowship in a group meeting.</p>
<p>A group meeting could be closed in the following way. One sister may report that a certain brother was not in the meeting last week or this week. She may ask if anyone knows why. Then another brother may respond that he knows that the brother is ill. After this fellowship the saints can pray for this brother, and after the prayer, two brothers may agree to go visit him immediately after the meeting. Thus, we can see the care and the shepherding taking place in the group meetings.</p>
<p>What we are proposing to the saints for their practice is this genuine kind of group meeting. This kind of meeting is without formality. It is not a traditional worship service. Instead, it is a Christian fellowship to take care of all the practical needs of the saints&mdash;the material needs, the spiritual needs, and the needs in the knowledge of the truth and the knowledge of the experience of life. In this meeting there is much nourishment, feeding, warning, and teaching for perfecting. Spontaneously, this group of about twenty persons shepherd one another mutually. They know one another, and they grow together. After about nine or more months, this group may grow to about thirty-five because they have brought in some new ones. At that time they can consider dividing into two groups.</p>
<p>This is the way to have the group meetings. It is not difficult, but we have to uproot the old way and plant the new way. The group meeting is not hard to practice, but everyone has to be living. Basically speaking, the way for us Christians to meet is to be in the spirit. When we sing, pray, intercede, and care for others, we must be in the spirit. For us all to be in the spirit is the unique way to hold our Christian meeting. If we are not in the spirit, how can Hebrews 10:24-25 be fulfilled? To come together to incite one another to love and good works and to exhort one another is by our being in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE SAINTS<br />
THAT THEY MAY DO THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY<br />
TO BUILD UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>To carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we have to perfect the saints that they may do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-12). To perfect the saints is to entreat and console the saints as a father (1 Thes. 2:11). Paul told the Thessalonians first in 2:7 that he was a nursing mother. Then in verse 11 he said that he was a consoling and entreating father. To entreat implies teaching and beseeching. It implies giving instructions, even with rebuking, admonishing, and warning, but this is not done without consoling. Our children need our consolation.</p>
<p>To perfect the saints is also to teach the saints publicly and from house to house, admonishing them unceasingly night and day with tears, even for three years, according to the pattern of the Apostle Paul (Acts 20:20, 31). For Paul to teach the saints publicly must have been publicly in bigger meetings. From house to house might be in groups. We have to do these two things. First, we need to have bigger meetings to give people messages to perfect them. We also have to go to their homes, from house to house, to admonish them as Paul did night and day with tears even for three years. After the Apostle Paul established the church in Ephesus, he did not stay away from the church. Instead, he visited the church, and he once stayed there for three years to do the perfecting work in the public meetings and in the homes of the saints, from house to house. He did this not only during the night, but also during the day. He practiced to perfect the saints even with tears. There has not been such a thing among us in the churches.</p>
<p>All of us, especially the leading ones and the co-workers, must uproot our old way and plant the new way. We must exercise ourselves in the new way. Both the brothers and the sisters need to be nursing mothers and entreating and consoling fathers in taking care of the new ones. We have to have meetings to speak to them in order to perfect them. Besides these meetings, we need to go to visit them in their homes, visiting them from house to house. We need to visit the believers and have group meetings with them in their homes. We should not have the group meetings in our home all the time. Then we will make our home a &ldquo;church.&rdquo; It is better to have the group meetings one week in our home, the next week in someone else&rsquo;s home, and the third week in another&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>All the gifted persons&mdash;not only the apostles, the prophets, and shepherds and teachers, but also the evangelists&mdash; should participate in the perfecting of the saints (Eph. 4:11-12). In particular, the evangelists have to perfect the saints to preach the gospel. The evangelists need to teach the saints the gospel truths. The saints need to be taught the truth concerning regeneration, justification, the washing away of sins and the forgiving of sins, and reconciliation. The evangelists need to teach the saints the distinctions and the differences among these truths.</p>
<p>They should also teach the saints techniques in the preaching of the gospel. In order to be effective in going to others for the preaching of the gospel, we have to learn many things. We have to learn the proper way to dress and comb our hair. We have to learn how to knock on the doors and how to speak an opening word. The saints need to be taught how to contact people and how to discern people. In a training in Taipei in 1954, I helped the saints to discern people by classifying them into different categories. When we go to visit people, we have to know people. When someone begins to talk to us, we may discern that he is a lover of money or of education. We have to talk to him in a way that matches the kind of person he is. Another person with whom we are talking may be a slow person. If we talk to him in a quick way, we will offend him. We have to know people in order to preach the gospel effectively. The new way will open up many new fields in the church life. This is why there is the need for the perfecting of the saints.</p>
<p>The purpose of the perfecting is to make all the common saints equipped to do the same work as the gifted persons do, that is, to build up the Body of Christ organically. Today only a minority of the saints can do the work of the ministry, but the day will come when everyone will be able to do the same thing. The perfecting of the saints helps the saints to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13). For the saints to arrive at a full-grown man, they need to be brought up. This is why Paul said that he was burdened to announce Christ in all wisdom so that he could present every believer full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28-29). By growing in Christ, eventually we will arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, which is the Body of Christ, the expression of Christ. This needs us to hold to truth in love that we may grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things (Eph. 4:15) for the organic building up of the church.</p>
<p>The perfecting of the saints also helps the saints to be no longer babes carried about by every wind of teaching (Eph. 4:14). The perfecting of the saints causes the Body of Christ to grow out from the Head unto the building up of the Body itself in love, through two groups of members: through every joint of the rich supply being joined closely together and through the operation in measure of each one part being knit together (Eph. 4:16). To perfect the saints will cause the entire Body, the entire church, to grow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH AS THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In order to carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel according to the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date recovery, all of us also need to prophesy for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:3-5). This requires the growth in life and in truth through some particular training. We need some training to train the saints in the growth in life and in the truth. There is also the need of some tutoring of the saints to enable them to prophesy. This is the face to face, one on one, tutoring. In order to prophesy, we also need to walk and live under the enlightenment of the divine light. If we are persons always under the light that we may be enabled to know the divine things, we will be able to prophesy. Furthermore, to prophesy we need to be always ready to receive spiritual inspiration in the constant fellowship with the Lord. We need to know the Word, we need to have the growth in life, we need to live under the divine light, and we always need to be ready to receive God&rsquo;s inspiration. Then we will be enabled to prophesy.</p>
<p>To carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we must have a time with the Lord every morning. During this time we should pray-read a few verses of a certain chapter of the Bible. By doing this, we will have some inner feeling which may be called the inner inspiration. We can then write down something to remind us of what we have been inspired with. We need to do this morning by morning for six days, from Monday to Saturday. On Saturday evening we can put all the inspirations that we have received during the past six mornings together and compose something to prophesy for the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting.</p>
<p>We should try to adjust what we compose so that we do not speak more than three minutes. If possible it is better to compose a prophecy with the help of someone who can act as a tutor. Two saints may even get together to tutor each other. They can even practice prophesying to each other so that they can adjust one another. In this way we can be ready to prophesy in the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. In the past, we may not have known what to speak or how to speak, but now we can have something when we come to the meeting. First Corinthians 14:26 tells us that whenever we come together, each one has something. When the time comes for us to speak, we can speak according to what we have labored on. We should not read what we have composed, but we should speak it.</p>
<p>At the beginning, what we speak may not be so organic, but we should try again and again by exercising our spirit. Then we will be brought into an organic situation, and we will improve. I believe that we will improve in two things. First, every morning we will have a good time with the Lord to enjoy Him with a few verses. When we pray-read these few verses, we will be nourished and receive some inspiration. This is very, very basic to our Christian life. By practicing this, we can lay a good foundation for us to do many things. This will enable us to feed the young ones, to go to home meetings and group meetings to help others. Furthermore, as we enjoy the Lord morning by morning in His Word, spontaneously, we will be built up to prophesy. Second, our capacity to prophesy will be developed unto our ability. We were created by God with a certain talent. Our God-given talent in addition to our education gives us a certain capacity. If we love the Lord and allow the Spirit to work in us, this working will be added to our natural capacity, producing a spiritual gift. As a result, some of the saints will not only prophesy in the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meetings but will also prophesy in the way of giving messages. They will be manifested as gifted persons in prophesying. It is in this way that the talents, the gifts, among us will be manifested. All the riches will be released to supply the entire Body. The abilities, the capacities, of the saints will be developed into gifts.</p>
<p>I hope that all of us would take the fellowship that we have received in this book and put it into practice. We need to remember that the basic thing is for us to uproot the old way and to plant the new way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO CARRY OUT<br />
THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD<br />
OF THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S UP-TO-DATE RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-6; 19:1-6, 9-10; John 4:3-7; 1 Pet. 2:5; 2 Tim. 4:2; 1 Cor. 9:22-23; Acts 5:42; John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; Rom. 12:1; Heb. 10:24-25</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to have more particular and detailed fellowship concerning the group gatherings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIVING CONTENTS<br />
OF THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Inciting One Another to Love and Good Works, Exhorting One Another</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:24-25 says, &ldquo;And let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.&rdquo; We need to &ldquo;consider one another&rdquo; for inciting, for encouraging, for stirring up, to love and good works. Paul also says that in the group meetings, we should be &ldquo;exhorting one another.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;one another&rdquo; indicates that Paul is not talking about a meeting of the entire congregation of the local church. The meetings mentioned in these two verses must be group meetings. When a large number of us come together, it is hard for us to exhort one another. It is difficult to do anything in a large meeting in the &ldquo;one another&rdquo; way. A meeting where a small number of people come together is a &ldquo;one another&rdquo; meeting. Therefore, Hebrews 10:24-25 does not refer to big meetings but to group meetings, in which we can consider one another and exhort one another, inciting one another to love and good works. When Paul says &ldquo;the assembling of ourselves,&rdquo; this means that these group meetings are our meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word, the Spirit, Praying, and Singing</h2>
<p>I do not believe that many of us have tasted this kind of group meeting. I am concerned about the contents of the group meetings that we have. Our meetings should be like a feast with many courses of food. If we were invited to a feast and there were only empty glasses on the table with no dishes, we would be very disappointed. What we went to was called a &ldquo;feast,&rdquo; but it actually was not a feast. It had the name of a feast without the reality of being a feast. In the same principle, many of us have attended meetings that are called &ldquo;group meetings,&rdquo; but they do not have the real contents of group meetings. Sometimes a Chinese feast may have twenty-two courses of food. Our meetings should be like that.</p>
<p>Our meetings should be full of the riches of Christ, and they should be composed of four basic factors and elements&mdash; the Word, the Spirit, praying, and singing. If we are going to have an enjoyable meeting, we must sing and pray. We should not come to the meeting in a dumb way, without singing or praying. We must pray and sing from our home. Furthermore, we must be in the Spirit. We even need to be crazy and ecstatic in the Spirit. We need to sing and pray in and with the Spirit. The stronger we exercise our spirit, the more joy we will participate in. We should not pray or sing without the Spirit. The fourth element we need in our meetings is the Word of God, the holy Word. We need the Holy Spirit and the holy Word to go along with us in our singing and praying. These four things are the basic elements that constitute our meeting.</p>
<p>If we pray without the Spirit, our prayer will be dead, empty, and cold. A prayer without the Spirit is a &ldquo;killing&rdquo; prayer, and it is the best sleeping dose. Such a prayer puts people to sleep. If we sing and pray without the Spirit in a group meeting, that group meeting has no reality. Some group meetings have attempted to use <em>Truth Lessons.</em> These truth lessons are based upon the holy Word, but if we handle these lessons in an improper way, they will become empty and dead. The Lord Jesus said that the words that He speaks to us are spirit and life (John 6:63). As long as the word used by us in a Christian meeting is not spirit and life, that is not the living word. That is merely the word according to the letter. The holy Word must be something full of the Spirit and full of life. We can use <em>Truth Lessons</em> in many different ways. We need to exercise our spirit whenever we come to the Holy Bible or to the printed ministry that opens up the Bible. When we exercise our spirit, the Word becomes living. When we read something with the exercise of our spirit, our reading becomes living and full of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Our Lord&rsquo;s table meetings should also have these four basic elements and factors: the Word, the Spirit, praying, and singing. When we are at the Lord&rsquo;s table, it is hard for someone to give a living word. I have a burden to train the saints how to give a living word even at the Lord&rsquo;s table. Mostly, the dear saints who distribute the bread in the table meeting do it in a silent way. When the bread is being distributed, someone can say a living word about its significance. As a brother is picking up the bread, he may say, &ldquo;Saints, this bread signifies two things. It signifies the Lord&rsquo;s physical body given on the cross for us, and it also signifies His mystical Body, which is the church composed of all of us. This morning we are taking this bread as a token of our remembrance of the Lord.&rdquo; Many new ones who attend the Lord&rsquo;s table may partake of the bread without knowing the significance of the bread. We need to have the Lord&rsquo;s table in a living way that is full of singing, full of praying, full of the Spirit, and full of the holy Word.</p>
<p>If someone speaks a word for one minute concerning the significance of the bread at the Lord&rsquo;s table, this word will give life and incite others to love the Lord and the saints. Because of such a word, some may pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You, and I love Your members. I want to live a life of loving You and of loving Your members. I would also like to live a life of loving the sinners and of bringing them to You.&rdquo; Because of such a living word at the Lord&rsquo;s table, the inciting power will operate within all the saints. Some of the new ones among us do not understand the significance of the cup that we drink at the Lord&rsquo;s table. They need someone to speak a living word in the table meeting concerning the significance of the cup that we drink. In every meeting we must have praying, singing, the Holy Spirit, and the holy Word.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning and Teaching the Truth<br />
and the Experience of Life Mutually</h2>
<p>According to our experiences and the study of the New Testament, we have found out that the group meetings occupy about eighty percent of the practical church life. If there are no group meetings in our local church, our church life cannot be that practical, strong, and living. We all must be trained to have these group meetings. The group meeting should not start after we arrive at the meeting place. It should be started in our home even before we have dinner. Before a brother begins to eat his dinner, he can sing to the Lord with a view that he is going to the group meeting. After he eats dinner, he can continue to sing to the Lord and keep singing in his car on the way to the meeting. Sometimes he may stop singing and begin to pray. If his wife goes with him to the meeting, they can both sing and pray together. But what if a brother has a disagreement with his wife before going to the group meeting? He needs to make a quick confession. While he is still in the car he can pray, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me for my attitude toward my wife.&rdquo; Then he can turn to his wife and say, &ldquo;Dear, please forgive me.&rdquo; Then his wife can tell him that she forgives him. They can both thank the Lord that His blood cleanses them. They can sing and pray together about the cleansing blood. Together they can pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, how we thank You for Your cleansing blood which keeps us living in Your presence and joyful in You. Thank You that we can live in Your presence without any hindrances or obstacles because Your blood cleanses us all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cleansing blood that this brother and his wife experience on the way to the meeting can be a subject for the group meeting. When he and his wife enter into the meeting place, they can say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Hallelujah! The blood of Jesus cleanses us!&rdquo; After eight or ten of the saints have arrived at the meeting, this brother may give a testimony: &ldquo;Brothers, while my wife and I were getting into the car, I expressed a wrong attitude toward her. That offended her and silenced her in the car. I began to feel that was not so good, so I asked the Lord to forgive me. Then I turned to my wife, confessed my weakness, and asked for her forgiveness. She forgave me, and we both became happy again. We began to thank and praise the Lord for His precious blood that always keeps us living in His marvelous and wonderful presence.&rdquo; After this kind of testimony, an older sister may say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! I experienced the same thing this morning. I thanked the Lord for His cleansing blood and asked Him to forgive me for my attitude toward my husband.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>After hearing these testimonies, a young sister may say that she does not know what the Lord&rsquo;s blood is. A brother in the meeting can respond, &ldquo;The blood is the Lord&rsquo;s blood which He shed for our sins. In Matthew 26 the Lord Jesus told us clearly that He shed His blood for the forgiveness of our sins. This blood is powerful in the eyes of God. When we confess our sins and apply the Lord&rsquo;s blood to our situation, this blood cleanses us in the eyes of God.&rdquo; When this brother gives such a word, it is a teaching to the young sister and also to all the other attendants. Everyone hears something concerning the cleansing of the blood.</p>
<p>Another brother in the meeting may say, &ldquo;We have an enemy, Satan, who is always accusing us. When we have even a small failure, he accuses us. The New Testament tells us that the blood of Jesus overcomes Satan, our accuser. When we make a mistake, we have no peace within us. This is because of God&rsquo;s condemnation, but at the same time the accuser is there accusing us. His accusation troubles us. When we confess our sins to God and apply the blood of the Lamb, which is the blood of the Lord Jesus, this blood washes away our sins. Then God forgives us and the accuser, the Devil, has no ground to accuse us any more.&rdquo; This brother&rsquo;s speaking is a little deeper than the other brother&rsquo;s speaking. In this group meeting, two brothers speak on the blood&mdash;one at the beginning and the other at the completion. Their speaking does not take too much time, but what they speak is a spontaneous teaching. If this kind of spontaneous teaching takes place in our group meetings, the saints will hear something of the truth every week and year-round.</p>
<p>Whenever we have the group meetings, we are free to cover all kinds of matters. This is included in our fellowship together. As I have illustrated, the fellowship in a group meeting may usher in a question about the cleansing blood of Jesus. That question results in an answer by two brothers. These answers become a good, practical teaching. After the two brothers speak, a young sister who is strong in praising the Lord may say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, how we praise You! We praise You for Your blood&mdash;the overcoming, prevailing, washing blood that keeps us clean in the eyes of God and that always keeps our enemy away.&rdquo; Another brother who is very thoughtful may ask another question. He may ask, &ldquo;Suppose I commit a sin and I confess this sin, but I don&rsquo;t have the feeling that the Lord&rsquo;s blood has cleansed me?&rdquo; This question will bring in further teachings from another angle. By this we can see that the group meetings will have many teachings. These teachings are not out of a lesson book as in a classroom, but they are teachings in a living way through the fellowship. What is spoken may not sound like a teaching, but it actually is a teaching. It is a teaching in the fellowship of the Christian brotherhood.</p>
<p>In order to carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we should first go to get sinners saved to make them sons of God and members of Christ. Then we should continue to feed them, to nourish and cherish them, as nursing mothers do with their infants. Within one or two weeks, we should bring them to the group meetings because these newly saved ones are not used to fellowship-ping with believers. They do not have this kind of habit. We have to bring the ones that we save and feed out of their houses to the nearby group meetings. After attending two group meetings, they will become familiar with the saints. They will observe how Christians meet together and take care of one another. They will be inspired and incited to love and good works. They will begin to participate in the meetings and even learn to ask questions and answer questions.</p>
<p>As a new brother begins to read his Bible, he may have a question concerning what the Sabbath is. A young sister may say, &ldquo;God created the heavens and the earth with all things in six days. Then on the seventh day He rested, and this day became a Sabbath. The Sabbath is not only for God to rest but also for us to rest.&rdquo; This speaking by this young sister should be considered as a teaching, but this teaching is not so complete. Another middle-aged sister who has been in the church for about five years may say a little more: &ldquo;The Bible tells us that God worked in creation for six days, and after working He rested. God created man on the sixth day. When man came out of God&rsquo;s creating hand, he immediately entered into rest. Man does not work first and then rest. Instead, man should rest and enjoy God and then begin to work. God works first and then He rests; but man should rest first and then work.&rdquo; Then another brother can say, &ldquo;What this sister described concerning the Sabbath is grace not law.&rdquo; Within a short time, the saints have rendered a very good teaching.</p>
<p>Questions concerning the truth will bring out more things and other questions. Another young brother who was recently saved last week may ask another question concerning what God&rsquo;s economy is. The answers to these questions do not come just from one person but from all the attendants. In the group meetings, everyone is equal. Everyone has an equal opportunity, the equal time, and the equal right to fellowship something, to say something, to ask something, and also to answer. We should not assign anyone to take the lead in a group meeting, but someone will spontaneously bear the responsibility of that group.</p>
<p>If we assign a brother to be the leader of a group meeting and also assign a helper to help him, this is organization. We do not like to have any element of organization in the church. Everything must be organic. We must kill any element of organization among us. We want to keep the group meeting in the hands of all the saints. Everyone in the group meeting is a leader. Even if a brother was baptized the previous night, he can be one of the leaders in the meeting because he has an equal opportunity to speak, to fellowship, to ask questions, and to answer others&rsquo; questions. All of the attendants in the group meeting can answer questions. Eventually, all these short answers added together equal a complete teaching of a certain truth. In one group meeting, three truths may be taught. Just as we illustrated, the truth concerning the blood of Christ, the Sabbath, and God&rsquo;s economy may be taught in a group meeting. Therefore, year-round many truths will be spontaneously covered. To cover the truths in this way is according to the way of the Bible. The Bible is not written in the way of a lesson book. The divine truths are scattered throughout the entire Bible.</p>
<p>I wrote <em>Truth Lessons</em> and <em>Life Lessons</em> according to an educational system in a systematic and progressive way. When we come to the group meetings, however, we should forget about having lessons according to the proper sequence. I am not saying, though, that we should not use <em>Truth Lessons</em> in the group meetings. If possible, all the attendants of a group meeting should own a copy of <em>Truth Lessons</em>. If we turn to any page of <em>Truth Lessons</em>, we will receive some benefit. Books such as <em>Truth Lessons</em> and <em>Life Lessons</em>
 are extremely profitable to read. Some saints practice putting the Life- studies and the publications of the ministry throughout their home. If we read just a few lines from the Recovery Version footnotes or the Life-studies, we will receive some profit. We need to redeem our time to get into the holy Word and into the publications that open up the holy Word. We may not need to use <em>Truth Lessons</em> in the group meetings, but we need to get ourselves prepared, strengthened, and instructed in the holy Word so that we will gain more and more knowledge concerning the things of God. The riches that we gain will come out in the group meetings.</p><h2 class="head2">Participating in the Fellowship, Interceding,<br />
and Mutual Care with the Saints</h2>
<p>The group meetings are also for us to participate in the fellowship, interceding, and mutual care with the saints. In a group meeting, a brother may say, &ldquo;Saints, I must let you know that Brother So-and-so was in a car accident yesterday.&rdquo; What this brother reports is a kind of fellowship. Then the saints may inquire about Brother So-and-so&rsquo;s situation. They will ask about how serious his accident was and about whether he is at home or in the hospital. The brother will have to give more details concerning the situation of this brother. Spontaneously and automatically the saints will begin to pray for this brother who had the accident. Others may ask concerning his financial situation, inquiring whether or not he has car insurance. Another sister may say that she found out that this brother lost his job last week. This fellowship will bring in the care and shepherding of this particular brother. Some of the saints will spontaneously bear the burden to supply him financially. An older brother in the group may say, &ldquo;Maybe tonight two or three brothers could go to see this brother.&rdquo; Then three brothers could volunteer to go and see the brother who had the accident. Their visit will comfort and shepherd this brother. A sister may say that she feels that this brother&rsquo;s wife needs someone to visit her. Then some sisters can agree to go see his wife the next day.</p>
<p>This gives us an illustration of the living contents of the group meetings. The living way to have the group meetings is to have singing, praying, and the exercise of the spirit with the Holy Spirit to apply the holy Word. This meeting also includes fellowship. The meeting may begin with fellowship, or the fellowship can be in the middle or at the end of the meeting. Anyway, there should always be the fellowship in a group meeting. This fellowship, as a rule, always brings in the intercession, the prayer for one another. It also brings in the mutual care of the saints. This mutual care can be physical, financial, or spiritual, and it will result in a mutual shepherding. Therefore, the members of this group will not need the elders to do the majority of the shepherding. They will shepherd themselves mutually.</p>
<p>If there are one thousand saints meeting together in a certain locality, the elders cannot be expected to shepherd all one thousand of these people. By the group meetings, however, the mutual shepherding of the saints will be thorough. All the members attending a group meeting know one another. Among them there will be a thorough, loving, and mutual shepherding. If some problems or hardships arise in the group meeting that the members cannot solve, they can refer these matters to the elders. Otherwise, all the problems will be taken care of by the group meeting itself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS BY THE GIFTS</h2>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 2:7 Paul told the Thessalonians that he cherished them as a nursing mother. Then in verse 11 he said that he entreated and consoled them as a father. In Acts 20 we see how Paul did this. When Paul was passing through Miletus, he sent for the elders of Ephesus to come to him (v. 17). He told them to remember how he had labored among them for three years (v. 31). This shows that we co-workers have to learn to stay in a place for three years. He told the elders that he had taught them publicly and from house to house (v. 20). To teach publicly, no doubt, is to hold bigger meetings. Paul also taught from house to house, which means that he taught according to the saints&rsquo; houses. He went to every house of the saints. He did not cease admonishing each one of the saints with tears, night and day for three years. He did not shrink from declaring to them all the counsel of God or anything that was profitable (vv. 27, 20). This means that he perfected the saints in their daily walk, in the human affairs of their life. He shared with them all the things concerning God&rsquo;s will, including God&rsquo;s purpose, God&rsquo;s plan, and God&rsquo;s economy. He was teaching the saints how to be Christians and how to know God, to know God&rsquo;s heart, to know God&rsquo;s will, to know God&rsquo;s plan, and to know God&rsquo;s economy. Within three years, day and night, he did much to perfect the saints. I believe that Paul attended many group meetings.</p>
<p>I would encourage all the churches to set up, to establish, group meetings. We co-workers must cooperate with the Lord, doing our best to speak in the meetings and also to go to the homes of the saints. When we attend a group meeting, we can realize that a certain brother has a problem. It is not convenient for us to address his problem in the meeting because this may expose him. We can go to him and make an appointment with him to see him the next day or at a time that is convenient for him. Paul did this day and night without ceasing. I hope that we could all prayerfully read Acts 20:20-21, 27, and 31. These verses show us how Paul perfected the saints. If we work as Paul worked, the saints will be properly raised up through our instruction, teaching, charge, warning, and admonishing. Then the church life will be strong.</p>
<p>To have merely a Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting with a good speaker in a congregation cannot take care of the Lord&rsquo;s interest. The Lord&rsquo;s economy cannot be carried out with that kind of practice. The traditional, unscriptural practice of Christianity just maintains a big congregation as a facade to make a show. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, however, we should forget about any kind of facade. We must work on the saints to instruct them, to warn them, to admonish them, and to console them. <em>Console</em> is a stronger word than <em>comfort.</em> We have to console the saints. They have troubles, and they become disappointed in their faith. They may begin to doubt the Lord. Therefore, we have to stay with them for a longer time to give them the proper consolation. Then they will not only be edified but also perfected.</p>
<p>We must take the organic way to build up the Body of Christ organically. Whether we teach, admonish, warn, rebuke, or console the saints, what we do must be organic. We should not advise the saints in an ethical, philosophical, and logical way without ministering God in Christ to them. If we merely minister ethics to people, our work is in the same nature as the work of someone like Confucius, who had many ethical teachings.</p>
<p>We should not minister mere ethical teachings to the saints. We should minister Christ. We are the ministers of Christ, serving people with Christ. We are the waiters or waitresses who serve people&rsquo;s &ldquo;table&rdquo; with Christ. Christ is the food in our &ldquo;restaurant,&rdquo; the food that we serve others. We do not merely teach Christ, but we serve Christ.</p>
<p>We need to serve Christ to the attendants in the group meetings. To serve Christ is to minister life. Whether we fellowship, take care of others, pray for others, shepherd others, ask a question, or answer a question as a teaching, what we do must be a ministering of Christ. It must be organic. Otherwise, we are merely teaching ethics to produce an ethical society, and what we teach will be in the same principle of the teaching of Confucius in the Far East and the ethical teaching of Christianity without Christ in the Western world. I would like to say again that we must minister Christ to people. This is the organic way to build up the church. Because we minister Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, into the believers, the believers will gradually have the increase of God in them. Then according to Colossians 2:19 the saints will grow with the increase of God. This increase is the growth in life, and the totality of the growth in life of all the saints is the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The truths which I have fellowshipped in this book have to get into us. These points are very new, so we must get into them and practice them. Then we will enjoy Christ, experience Christ, and gain Christ more and more. As a result, we will have the growth in Christ for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD<br />
OF THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S UP-TO-DATE RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-6; 19:1-6, 9-10; John 4:3-7; 1 Pet. 2:5; 2 Tim. 4:2; 1 Cor. 9:22-23; Acts 5:42; John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; Rom. 12:1; Heb. 10:24-25</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The New Testament revelation concerning the priesthood of the gospel is entirely different from the practice in Christianity. Because the priesthood of the gospel is according to the divine, biblical revelation and not according to human thought, we have to receive it. This divine revelation will revolutionize our entire concept and change our entire practice. We are believers chosen by God, redeemed by Christ, and regenerated by the Spirit. Now we are priests. A priest is one who is so close to God, who is one with God, and who can have God&rsquo;s oracle to speak to people. Such a one can also bring God to man and bring man back to God.</p>
<p>The Old Testament priests only handled the types of Christ that pointed to the coming Christ, but we New Testament priests have received Christ, and Christ has entered into us. Now we are in Christ, and Christ is in us. We are even one with Christ, so whatever He is and has is ours. We can go out in the condition of the Triune God being wholly one with us. We go out with the Triune God. We go to command the sinners to repent with the authority of Christ. The Lord Jesus said that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth, and then He charged us to go and disciple the nations (Matt. 28:19). We go to disciple the nations with His authority, baptizing them into the Triune God. We do not just impart the Triune God into them. After they receive the Triune God, we have to baptize them into the Triune God to make them one with God. To preach the gospel is to go out with Christ and with His divine authority to visit our relatives, friends, classmates, colleagues, and neighbors. We have to preach the gospel as priests, making this a part of our daily walk, our daily life.</p>
<p>To go to visit sinners and get them saved that they may be made the sons of God and the members of Christ is the first step of the priestly service, the priesthood. The New Testament priests are linked with the gospel. In the past when we talked about the priests, we never thought about the gospel. We considered that the priests and the gospel were two absolutely separate items. This shows that we were short of spiritual sight, spiritual vision. We did not see that the preaching of the gospel is the priesthood. We need to see that the priesthood is linked with the preaching of the gospel. The preaching of the gospel is our daily life, our daily work, because the preaching of the gospel is the work and the duty of the New Testament priests.</p>
<p>If the offering of the sacrifices were taken away from the Old Testament priests, they would have nothing to do; they would have no daily living. Everything would be meaningless to them. The daily work and the daily living of the New Testament priests is also to offer the sacrifices in reality. While we are preaching the gospel, we are the energizing priests, fulfilling our daily duty to offer the saved sinners to God as acceptable sacrifices. From now on, whenever we preach the gospel to sinners, we must have the deep sensation that we are the energizing priests, struggling and endeavoring to do our daily duty to fulfill our priesthood. This realization will make a great difference in our daily life. If we do not understand that our preaching of the gospel is the fulfilling of our priestly duty, we will only preach the gospel when we feel like it. When we are happy, we will preach the gospel. When we are not happy, we will forget about preaching the gospel. If something is our duty, however, we do not do it according to how we feel.</p>
<p>To illustrate this let us consider a sister who is a housewife. A good housewife is always on duty. She may have three children&mdash;one in kindergarten, one in elementary school, and another one in junior high school. Every morning she is busy preparing breakfast for each one. All three children are different with their particular characteristics, and they may want different things for breakfast. One may want a soft-boiled egg, and another may want scrambled eggs. The third child may want his eggs cooked the way that he saw them cooked in the school cafeteria. Thus, every morning the mother makes eggs for her children in three different, particular ways. After they eat breakfast, she has to drive them to different schools at different times. This is her duty as a mother and as a housewife. She cannot tell her children that she is tired and that they need to take care of themselves. She fulfills her daily duty regardless of how she feels. Because she realizes that this is her duty as a housewife, she carries out her daily duty regardless of her feeling. Do we realize that we have to preach the gospel because it is our duty? Have we preached the gospel with the deep sensation that we are fulfilling our duty? Our preaching of the gospel is to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and this is the New Testament priesthood assigned to God&rsquo;s children as priests.</p>
<p>To fulfill such a duty, we must be the energizing priests. To be a mother raising up children, in a certain respect, is a joyful thing, but in order for a mother, a housewife, to fulfill her daily duty, she must be energizing. Paul practiced the priesthood in the same way. In Romans 15:16 he said that he was a minister of Christ Jesus, an energizing priest of the gospel of God. He was an energizing priest to offer the nations to God as acceptable sacrifices. Because Paul saw and realized this, he took this as his daily duty. One day our feelings may be very high, and we may want to preach the gospel everywhere. Two days later we may feel down, and we will not want to preach the gospel. This is why I do not like to see the saints so excited in a natural way. We may be excited one day and down the next day. What we need is a daily revival. We need to live a priest&rsquo;s life. We have been chosen, saved, regenerated, and ordained to be the New Testament priests of the gospel. Now we are not so free because we have a priestly duty to fulfill.</p>
<p>To fulfill our priestly duty we have to learn to be energizing. The first thing we have to do is to get sinners saved. God has chosen thousands of people on this earth and has ordained them to be the sons of peace, but we have to go out to visit people to find these sons of peace (Luke 10:1-6). Whether or not someone is a son of peace cannot be determined by only one visit. We may have knocked on a man&rsquo;s door when he was fighting with his wife. When we tell him that we have come to preach the gospel to him, he will not have a heart for it. We should not think that he is not a son of peace. We visited him at the wrong time. We better try to go back to him again after three weeks. Three weeks later, he may be happy when we visit him. Then he will receive us and also receive the Lord. In Luke 10 the Lord told the seventy that He sent them out as lambs in the midst of wolves (v. 3). It is hard to say just by one visit whether a person is a son of peace or a wolf. We must go back to visit people again and again.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus gained His disciples by His traveling. When He was traveling by the seashore of Galilee, He called Peter, Andrew, James, and John (Matt. 4:18-22). Later as He traveled, He saw Matthew the publican sitting in the customs office, and He said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me&rdquo; (Matt. 9:9). Luke 8:1 tells us that the Lord Jesus traveled from city to city and from village to village to visit and gain the sinners. In the Lord&rsquo;s earthly ministry, He did not formally arrange to have big meetings. Instead, He traveled to bring the gospel to sinners. Therefore, as the New Testament priests fulfilling our New Testament priesthood, the first thing we have to do is to go to visit the sinners where they are. If they are not at home but working in the factory, we may need to go visit them in the factory during the time that they have a break. Our preaching of the gospel is not just the outward form of knocking on doors. We must visit people and gain them where they are.</p>
<p>When we go to visit people, we go as priests of God with God&rsquo;s authority. When we go in this way, our speaking will be with authority. Only the Spirit knows what we will speak. If we live a life of the priesthood, we will go out to preach the gospel with much prayer. Then our going will be our being sent out by the Lord. When we visit people, we will always say something instantly to meet the instant need. When someone answers the door we may say, &ldquo;We were sent by Jesus Christ to come here to pass on grace and peace to you.&rdquo; When we speak in this way, the person to whom we speak will respond in a positive way. He may say that he wants grace and peace and that he would like to know who Jesus Christ is.</p>
<p>If we go out to visit people in a loose way without much prayer and only tell them that the church sent us here to preach the gospel, they will turn us away. We must go out to visit people with much prayer and with much realization that we are not ordinary persons but God&rsquo;s priests. When we visit someone with the gospel, we may tell him, &ldquo;God sent me to see you to make you rich.&rdquo; When we tell someone that we are coming to make him rich, he will be happy. We are telling him the truth. We came to make him rich in salvation, rich in Christ, rich in grace, rich in peace, and rich in many other things. He is a poor person, but we have come to make him rich. The point I am making is that the Spirit knows how to lead us to speak a particular word. Quite often, we do not need to say too much to someone. After a little conversation, he may be ready to pray to receive the Lord.</p>
<p>We need to take the preaching of the gospel as our duty and do it regularly, constantly, and continuously. It is best if we would make a budget of our time. Now that we have seen that the preaching of the gospel is our daily duty, we need to realize that this does not mean that we have to deliver a child every day. Even in the natural realm, it normally takes a woman nine months to deliver a child. We should not go out and get too many people baptized in one day. That would be foolish because we could not take care of all of them. We need to exercise &ldquo;birth control&rdquo; in our preaching of the gospel. We should just go out one or two nights a week until we can get two or three people baptized. Sometimes in one night we may get three baptized in one home&mdash;a husband, his wife, and their son. After baptizing them, we should stay with them for a long time and then go back to them the next day. We should not go to knock on more doors because these three babies are enough for us to care for. We should go back to them frequently to feed them and to care for them. Mothers know that their feeding of their little ones must be regular, constant, and continuous. We should go back to visit these new ones again and again until we realize that they are settled in the Christian faith.</p>
<p>We can bring them to the group meetings so that they can become acquainted with other Christians and have fellowship with them. They need the mutual care and mutual shepherding in the group meetings. We can also bring them to the larger church meetings where they can participate with the saints to prophesy for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ. It is best if we can spend an entire year to take care of these new ones so that they will be kept as remaining fruit and be perfected to do the same thing that we are doing in our priestly service.</p>
<p>After we feel that these new ones have been raised up, we can go out to get some others saved, and we can do this kind of work year-round. If we can arrange our time properly, this will not be too difficult for us to carry out. To raise up children is not an easy task, but if we do it properly, regularly, constantly, and continuously, it will not be too difficult. Our labor to raise up the new ones is like the raising up of our children. If we labor in this way, we can gain one or two remaining fruit year-round. If many saints labor as priests of the gospel, there will be a good percentage of increase in all of the local churches.</p><h2 class="head1">PAYING THE PRICE TO ENTER<br />
INTO THE SCRIPTURAL WAY</h2>
<p>During the past four and a half years, I have been burdened to reconsider our way. In my reconsideration, I was reminded of Brother Nee&rsquo;s fellowship with us in 1937 concerning the need to recover the church meeting of mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. This fellowship has been printed in the book entitled <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> At that time, however, we did not find a way to replace the traditional way of one speaking and the rest listening with this scriptural practice. In 1948 Brother Nee fellowshipped with us again along these lines. These messages are printed in the book entitled <em>Church Affairs.</em> He told us that the so-called Sunday morning service in which one man speaks and the rest listen is unscriptural and according to the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8). He proposed that we put this kind of meeting aside and encourage all the saints to go out and preach the gospel on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Within a short time after Brother Nee gave this fellowship, however, the Communists took over mainland China, so we did not have a chance to work out his burden.</p>
<p>As I began to restudy our situation in 1984, I was reminded of Brother Nee&rsquo;s vision. I realized that now might be the time and that we are the people to carry out this vision. When I began to take this way, some of the older co-workers would not take it. They would not give up the practice of one man speaking and the rest listening. It was hard for them to change because they had been practicing according to the traditional way for many years.</p>
<p>All of us have to pay the price to enter into the scriptural way of meeting revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. We need to practice 1 Corinthians 14:26&mdash;&ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has.&rdquo; To carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, His eternal plan for the New Testament age, all of us who are His children should learn to exercise the capacities in the divine life He has given us. Even in the human life, there are many capacities. When a baby is delivered and he cries, everyone is happy. His crying is a sign that he is living and that he has the capacity to utter something. From the time of its delivery, an infant is complete in the sense of having all the capacities in its human life for it to function properly. He has the capacity to hear, see, smell, eat, speak, and walk. An infant has the capacity to learn a language. All these capacities are concealed, so they need to be developed by the growth in life and by practice. An infant&rsquo;s growth in life will increase what he can practice, and the more he practices, the more development he will gain. At a certain point, a babe will begin to say &ldquo;ma ma&rdquo; and &ldquo;da da&rdquo; spontaneously. The ability to speak is hidden within his human life, so he needs the opportunity to practice.</p>
<p>Now that we have been regenerated, we have received the divine life of our divine Father. Surely the divine life is much richer and much stronger than our human life. This stronger and richer life has its capacities also. All the capacities within our human life are present at birth. Now we are the children of God, and there are many capacities in the divine life that we have received from our spiritual birth. Despite all of these capacities, many have been Christians for years and they can do very little for the Lord in the way of spiritual service. If we say that we love the church, and our service is only to do something such as vacuuming the carpet for the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting, this is to despise God&rsquo;s divine life, to annul the functions of God&rsquo;s divine life, to put aside all the abilities concealed in God&rsquo;s divine life. It is better to hire some janitors to clean the hall, and let the saints go to visit people with the gospel.</p>
<p>We may have been saved for many years, yet we have never spent an adequate time with our relatives to speak Christ to them. If we visit some of our relatives for half a year on a continual basis, they will be saved. Suppose a sister picks up the burden to visit her aunt. With fear and trembling she could pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Help me, Lord. Now I have to go to my aunt. I don&rsquo;t know what to say, Lord. Tell me what I have to say, Lord.&rdquo; Then when she goes, the Lord will answer her prayer. She may say to her aunt with tears, &ldquo;Dear aunt, I really love you, and I have to apologize to you. I believe in the Lord Jesus. I have been saved for many years, but I never came to you to speak the Lord Jesus to you. Today I have come to tell you that the Lord Jesus is the real Savior.&rdquo; When the aunt hears this, she will be touched by the Lord. She may say, &ldquo;I want to receive your Savior, Jesus Christ, as my Savior. I want to pray with you.&rdquo; We need to serve the Lord in this way in the gospel rather than merely in the sundry affairs.</p>
<p>Suppose that instead of vacuuming the carpet for three weeks, a brother went to visit his aunt one week, his cousin the next week, and his grandfather the third week. How marvelous it would be if all three of them got saved! After six months of this kind of exercise, a brother or sister will be a top expert in preaching the gospel by visiting people. We have to learn to go visit our relatives, classmates, colleagues, and acquaintances according to the way that I have illustrated. We need to go to them with a weeping heart, with the intimate concern. We do not need to speak too much. The Spirit will be with us, and we will learn to preach the gospel in many ways.</p>
<p>After half a year, the Lord may say, &ldquo;I am so happy with you because you dropped the vacuuming of the carpet and picked up serving me according to My New Testament economy as a New Testament priest, preaching My gospel. Now I want you to perfect others to do the same thing.&rdquo; We may feel that we do not know how to do this, but we must take the Lord&rsquo;s word and go by faith. If the Lord tells us to perfect others, we should go to perfect others with faith in His word. We may not know how to do it, but He knows how. A sister may visit another sister in the church with the burden to perfect her. She may tell her, &ldquo;I came to you to fellowship in love about one thing. Up until six months ago, I served in the church by vacuuming the carpet every Saturday. Six months ago, the Lord asked me why I had to spend one and a half hours every Saturday vacuuming the carpet, forgetting about the salvation of my aunt, my cousin, my grandfather, and the rest of my relatives. I wanted to fellowship with you and ask you how you feel about this. I know you love the Lord, and you also go to the hall to clean. I have not come to distract you from the church&rsquo;s direction. We love the church, and we respect and regard the elders to the uttermost. But consider which is more important&mdash;to vacuum the carpet or to save our relatives. We realize that the church here has not increased much in the last three years. Why don&rsquo;t we go together to visit our close relatives and our neighbors?&rdquo; For a sister to fellowship with another sister in this way is what it means to perfect the saints. Then she can go with this sister to preach the gospel without doing anything to replace her. After two or three weeks of functioning in the gospel, this sister will receive some perfecting. After one year, these two sisters can go to perfect two others. In this way, the perfecting of the saints will spread throughout the church.</p>
<p>We can carry out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel on the one hand and the perfecting of the saints on the other hand. God wants all of us to do the work of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Even though we may not be these gifted persons, we can be perfected to do their work. The only difference is the quantity of work we do. The gifted persons may do more work, and we may do less. In totality, however, the work of all the saints put together will be much more than the work of the gifted persons alone. Regardless of how gifted one person is, he cannot replace the work of one million members of the Body. They can bring one million people to salvation in a year and care for them, whereas one gifted person cannot.</p>
<p>Now the Lord has given us the new light that we have to practice the universal prophesying because Paul says we can all prophesy one by one (1 Cor. 14:31). This indicates that we all have the capacity to prophesy. Paul says in verses 23 and 24 that when &ldquo;the whole church comes together in one place...if all prophesy....&rdquo; This means we have the obligation to prophesy.</p>
<p>We may ask, &ldquo;If everyone speaks, what will those who have been speaking to us for years do?&rdquo; Thank the Lord that He has given the churches some real speaking brothers. We may consider these brothers as prophets, who have been prophesying in the churches for years. According to the New Testament, the prophets who are the gifts in Ephesians 4:11 speak for God, but they do not speak as those who carry out the regular meetings of the church by themselves. The regular meetings of the church should be for the universal prophesying. Every week the whole church should come together for all of the attendants to prophesy. All the churches, however, still need the prophets who are the particular gifts to the Body. Paul was such a prophet. There must be special meetings for such gifted members to do their work. Paul had a special meeting at Troas, recorded in Acts 20. He stayed at Troas for one week and spoke on the Lord&rsquo;s Day for the whole night. That was a special meeting for a gifted person such as the Apostle Paul to function for the perfecting of the saints. We cannot make the regular meetings of the church like this. Otherwise, we would &ldquo;kill&rdquo; all the attendants. We need to see, however, that there is much need of the proper, able, capable, and experienced prophets among us.</p>
<p>Recently one of the elders in Tokyo moved to a nearby small town for the spreading of the recovery. A number of the saints went to visit people in this town for the preaching of the gospel. After about one month, they felt they needed a big gospel preaching meeting. Do not misunderstand what I have said concerning the big gospel preaching meeting. I do not condemn the big meeting for the preaching of the gospel. What I mean is that the church should not make the big preaching meeting a regular practice that replaces the individual preaching of the saints by visiting people. When the saints in Tokyo had this big gospel preaching meeting in this small town, over three hundred new ones came. They came as a result of the saints visiting people for a period of time. Therefore, that big gospel preaching meeting was a real reaping. This is absolutely right, but the regular preaching of the gospel should be by the priests of the New Testament, that is, by all the saints.</p>
<p>Because of the Lord&rsquo;s rich mercy, we may have a number of gifted evangelists among us, and they can be used to reap the new ones. All of the saints should personally visit others for the preaching of the gospel, but in this kind of visiting it is hard to give others a longer speaking on a particular gospel subject. A big gospel meeting can fulfill this function. There could even be an entire weekend of big gospel meetings for the purpose of reaping the new contacts of the saints. All the saints could bring the ones whom they have contacted for the past month. If many bring one or two new ones, the meeting hall will be filled with them. All of these new ones will have been prepared by the Lord. They will have already called on the name of the Lord. One of the brothers may give a message concerning what the Christian faith is. All the new ones will like to hear this. Now that they have called on the name of Christ, they will want to know what the Christian faith is. Not every believer can give such a long message on a certain topic of the gospel, but every believer can visit people to bring them to Christ.</p>
<p>In a big gospel meeting, a brother may decide to share on the existence of God. Although the new ones have believed and called on the name of the Lord Jesus, they may wonder how we can prove that God exists. Not many saints can give a message on this subject, so there is the need of a big meeting with a particular gifted person who can give three messages to show people the existence of God. These messages will be convincing, subduing, and enlightening. After hearing this, all the newly contacted ones will be established and happy.</p>
<p>We should have meetings like this regularly. It is not too much to have these meetings once a month. Because the church is rich, hundreds of the saints should go out daily as priests to do a daily work, to live their daily life in preaching the gospel of God. The other side is that we need some gifted evangelists to preach the truth of the gospel. An evangelist may decide to speak concerning the matter of sin. The new ones may have called on the name of the Lord with the saints who visited them. They may have confessed that they are sinful, but deep within them they are not clear about what sin is. We can have a conference of four messages to release a deeper teaching concerning the matter of sin. This convinces, establishes, strengthens, and keeps people. We should have meetings like this to show the riches of the church.</p>
<p>The same principle holds true with the matter of prophesying. The regular church meetings must be occupied and used by all the saints for them to discover their capacity, to develop their ability, and to build up and foster their energy to speak for the Lord. In this way opportunities will be given to all the saints. Whatever the saints have and can do will come to the surface. Then their gifts will be manifested, and they will become useful in the church life. This does not mean, however, that we annul or stop the particular gifts of the prophets. We should hold conferences on a periodic basis, perhaps once a month or once every three months. Furthermore, these gifted persons have to travel from city to city to prophesy. This is the right way.</p>
<p>I hope that this fellowship has rendered us a proper understanding. No one among us can be made useless. Rather, the scriptural way makes every saint more useful. By this way all the saints have the equal opportunity to preach the gospel, all have the equal opportunity to take care of the new ones, all have the equal opportunity to do the shepherding and build up the small groups, and all have the equal opportunity to speak for the Lord. Then all the riches in every believer will be developed, fostered, strengthened, and manifested.</p>
<p>I want to repeat again, though, that the function of the gifted persons listed in Ephesians 4:11 is vital. These gifted persons perfect all the saints to do the work of the ministry. Ephesians 4:16 shows us that the Body causes itself to grow by two categories of members: the joints of the rich supply (the gifted persons) and each one part (every member of the Body). Thus, every member of the Body is occupied with some function. No one is idle. This causes the entire Body to grow, and this growth is the building up. The Body is then built up by itself, not only spontaneously, automatically, but also organically. In the organic Body of Christ, everyone should be busy with much to do, but is the situation among us today like this? There are many needs among us. A number of the saints among us are really gifted, but they are covered and even annulled by our present practice.</p>
<p>My burden for the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is with a happy expectation. I know that the day will dawn when what I have spoken will come to pass because it is not from my imagination, but it is something of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. All of us are included in this economy. This fellowship concerning the present advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery liberates us from the tyranny and the bondage of the old system. I am for the &ldquo;layman&rsquo;s emancipation.&rdquo; I want to see all the &ldquo;laymen&rdquo; liberated. Actually, there should be no clergy, no hierarchy, and no laymen among us. All of us must function in the New Testament priesthood as priests of the gospel.</p>
<p>In this book, I am burdened to present the vision of the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. Once we see the vision, we must enter into the practice of the vision. I am burdened to train the saints in the practice of carrying out the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God according to the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. We all need to be perfected to preach the gospel as priests of the gospel of God. The priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament is altogether missing in the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s children today. This is a new discovery. It is something new on this earth. The same holds true with the other three items of the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. The organic building up of the Body of Christ, the perfecting of the saints by the gifts, and the prophesying for the building up of the church are new items in the experience of the Lord&rsquo;s children. Prophesying for the building up of the church is mentioned clearly in 1 Corinthians 14, but where is such a practice on this earth? This is altogether new. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, He has shown me these things, and I am burdened to release them to the churches to give the saints a vision.</p>
<p>However, how to carry out these four major items is a big problem. We all have to learn something, and I feel that I must take the lead to learn. Whatever I learn, I will present to the saints. I hope that we all would pray for the carrying out of the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today.</p></body></html>
