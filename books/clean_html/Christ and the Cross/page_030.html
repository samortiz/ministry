<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BEING THE CENTER<br />
OF THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHECIES</h2>
<p>In eternity God planned and determined that the cross would be fulfilled in time. Hence, even before the time of its fulfillment, God used types, figures, and prophecies in many portions of the Old Testament to reveal the cross in a clear and detailed way.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament types and prophecies God not only revealed the coming Christ, but God also spoke of the work of the cross that would be fulfilled through Christ. The Old Testament reveals Christ before His incarnation, and it also presents the cross in a definite way. The Old Testament is full of Christ, and it is also full of the cross.</p>
<p>For example, the sacrifice in the garden of Eden (Gen. 3:21), the sheep offered by Abel (4:4), the sacrifices offered by the patriarchs (8:20; 12:7; 13:18; 22:13; 26:25), and the passover lamb (Exo. 12; cf. 1 Cor. 5:7) all portray the work of the cross. The altar and the sacrifices (cf. Heb. 13:10), the smitten rock (Exo. 17:6; cf. 1 Cor. 10:4), and the bronze serpent (Num. 21:9; cf. John 3:14) are further examples of types related to the cross. Even the hanging of a convicted person on a tree is a type that portrays the cross (Deut. 21:22). Genesis 3:15, Psalm 22:1 and 6-18, Isaiah 53:4-10, and Zechariah 12:10 all speak of the cross.</p>
<p>If we understand the Bible, we will see the importance of the cross through the Old Testament types and prophecies. Everything that God intends to fulfill and obtain, everything that He promises to His chosen ones, and everything that He gives to His people involve the work of the cross. Everything is achieved through the cross. Christ and the cross are at the center of the Old Testament prophecies: Christ is the purpose, and the cross is the procedure. In order to understand the prophecies in the Old Testament, we must know both Christ and the cross. Christ and the cross are the key to the prophecies in the Old Testament. If we know Christ and His cross, we will have the secret to understanding the prophecies in the Old Testament. This is what the Lord Jesus revealed to His disciples after His resurrection (Luke 24:13-27, 44-46).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BEING THE CENTER<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT REVELATION</h2>
<p>The Old Testament ushers in the New Testament, and the New Testament fulfills the Old Testament. The Old Testament prophecies take Christ and His cross as the center, and the New Testament revelation also takes Christ and His cross as the center. The New Testament emphatically speaks of Christ being the center of everything, but it also speaks just as emphatically concerning the cross. The four Gospels present Christ and the cross. The four Gospels portray Christ to us, and they also portray the work that He accomplished on the cross. If we want to understand the four Gospels, we must know both Christ and the cross.</p>
<p>The book of Acts testifies concerning the resurrected and ascended Christ and concerning His cross. Through the cross Christ was ushered into resurrection and ascension to become the resurrected and ascended Christ. In order to know such a Christ, we must see His cross, and we must know Him through His cross. Christ is the goal in the book of Acts, and His cross is also the basis of the book of Acts.</p>
<p>The Epistles place equal emphasis on Christ and His cross. Paul said, &ldquo;I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:2). Paul preached nothing other than &ldquo;Christ crucified&rdquo; (1:22-23). He did not present signs for the Jews or wisdom for the Greeks. Instead, Paul considered Christ and the cross of Christ as the power of God (vv. 24, 18). Christ and the cross are the center of Paul&rsquo;s speaking. Paul was hated by people because he preached the cross of Christ (Gal. 5:11). Paul was used by God, and his message was powerful because he preached the cross of Christ. Peter and John also presented Christ, who accomplished redemption, and His cross as the center of their speaking (1 Pet. 1:3, 18-19; 2:21-24; 3:18; 4:1-2; 1 John 1:7; 3:16; 4:10; 5:6). In order to understand the Epistles, we must know Christ and His cross. We can touch the reality in the Epistles only by seeing Christ and His cross.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation is a &ldquo;revelation of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1:1). This book opens a heavenly veil to reveal Christ; therefore, it is a particular book concerning Christ. However, Revelation reveals that the Christ who has received glory in heaven and for eternity is the Lamb who has been slain (5:6). When Revelation speaks of the status of Christ, it refers to Him as the Lamb standing as having just been slain. The title <em>Lamb</em> reminds us of the cross of Christ and turns our attention to the cross of Christ. Hence, Revelation also takes Christ as its center and the cross of Christ as its focus.</p>
<p>Both Christ and His cross are the center of the New Testament revelation. If we want to know the New Testament revelation, we must know not only Christ but also the cross. Christ and the cross are the secret to understanding the New Testament revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BEING THE CENTER<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>The cross occupies an important and central place in the Old Testament prophecies and in the New Testament revelation because the cross is the center of God&rsquo;s work of redemption. God&rsquo;s work of redemption was carried out by Christ and through the cross. Just as there is no redemption apart from Christ, there is also no redemption apart from the cross. Both Christ and the cross are the center of God&rsquo;s redemption. Forgiveness, cleansing, justification, sanctification, reconciliation, regeneration, eternal life, emancipation, and every other spiritual blessing in God&rsquo;s redemption are in Christ and through the cross (Eph. 1:3). In order to obtain and experience these spiritual blessings, we must know Christ and His cross. We can obtain these blessings only in Christ, and we can experience them only through the cross.</p>
