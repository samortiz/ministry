   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>STRENGTHENING THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit functions to strengthen the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Ephesians 3:16 Paul prayed that the Father would grant the saints "to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Father strengthens us through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the means that the Father uses to strengthen us is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For Christ to make His home in our hearts, there is the need of strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No one can do this but the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Ephesians 3 the Spirit of God is the strengthening Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit not only quenches, saturates, transfuses, infuses, and grows, but also strengthens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>XVII.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>SUPPLYING THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know that the Spirit functions to supply the believers because Philippians 1:19 speaks of "the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit of God had to be processed and consummated to be the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In eternity past the Triune God possessed merely divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this sense, we may say that He was "raw," or unprocessed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then He created the universe and a man by the name of Adam with the intention of coming into him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After the creation of man, however, man became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later, the Triune God came to join Himself with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He became a man who was both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He lived on this earth in humanity for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After having passed through such a human living, He was qualified to die an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to die such an all-inclusive death, He had to be a God-man, a man mingled with God, and He had to pass through human life for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without such a qualification, He would not have been able to die such a wonderful death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He entered into this death and stayed in death for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then He walked out of death into resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This life-giving Spirit now consists of divinity, humanity, human living, Christ's all-inclusive death, and His wonderful resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The life-giving Spirit is the issue of the Triune God's process from incarnation to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now this life-giving Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God but the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With such a Spirit, there is the bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lemon tea can be used as an illustration of the bountiful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, there is only the plain water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when tea and lemon are added to the water, it becomes a composition of three elements.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we drink it, we receive the elements of the water, the tea, and the lemon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This can be considered as a "bountiful-supply drink."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is such an all-inclusive bountiful drink, with all the elements of the Triune God's person and processes to supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit not only strengthens us but also supplies us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is difficult to explain how the Spirit strengthens and supplies us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we eat food, we are strengthened and supplied, but it is difficult to say how this takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even medical doctors cannot explain fully what it means to be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many years ago no one knew what vitamins were.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There was not even such a word in the dictionary years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our ancestors, however, were nourished with many vitamins without knowing about vitamins.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may feel fatigued at a certain point in the day, but after we eat, we are nourished, strengthened, and supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may not be able to explain how this happens, but we can experience and enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same way, we may not be able to explain how the Spirit strengthens and supplies us, but we can experience His strengthening and supplying.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some of us may come to the meetings in a fatigued way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to get ourselves nourished, strengthened, and supplied by eating a "meal," by enjoying the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For us to eat a physical meal may require twenty-five to thirty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But to take a spiritual meal, we may need just two and a half minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we take a few minutes to pray, we are strengthened and supplied by the functioning Spirit.</S>
