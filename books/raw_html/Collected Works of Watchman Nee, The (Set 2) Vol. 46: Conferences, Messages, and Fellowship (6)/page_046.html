<h2 class="head1">THE DISCIPLINE BY THE FATHERS</h2><p>Our Lord said, "My Father is the husbandman" (John 15:1). There is a discipline which might be termed parental discipline, in contrast to the brotherly discipline of which we have just spoken. In the latter case the one corrected and the one who corrects stand on equal footing; in the former case the one who corrects is in a place of spiritual seniority. This is indicated in Paul's word: "You who are spiritual restore such a one" (Gal. 6:1). But even one who is spiritually more advanced than another should never take a "better-than-thou" position, as if he is looking down from a pedestal to correct an inferior. On the basis of spiritual seniority he can draw on his past experience to help the offender; but he should recall the injunction: "Restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, looking to yourself lest you also be tempted" (Gal. 6:1). This mode of discipline is the most precious of all, yet it is the kind that is most sadly lacking in the church. There is a simple reason for this: the church lacks "fathers," that is, mature Christians with ripe spiritual experience.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SON</h2><p>The discipline of the Son is commonly termed "excommunication." In the two previous forms of discipline the individual is the one taking the initiative; in this instance the church rises up to purge the church. We know that the church is the house of God, but it is the Son who administers the affairs of God's house (Heb. 3:6). The house of God demands righteousness and holiness from all who abide there; it also demands order and subjection to authority. But it should be clearly recognized that it is the Son over God's house who exercises all authority in the house; the church has no authority whatsoever. Determining whether or not a member shall be excommunicated does not rest with the church. The church simply bows to the authority of the Head and gives effect to His instructions. The excommunication of any member should never be merely a matter of business; it should be a matter of heart-concern for the whole church. It is an abominable thing to see the excommunication of any child of God carried out in a trifling manner, as though it were a light thing. It is no less abominable to see it carried out in a serious manner, if the seriousness is only that of a law court. How tragic it is to witness brothers excommunicating brothers, as though one were witnessing the procedure of a law case! The matter of church discipline is on a plane far different from that of enforcing the righteousness of the law. No excommunication should be without grief and tears on the part of those who exercise discipline; and no excommunication can be without grief and tears on the part of those who exercise discipline if they have clearly seen what the church is. In 1 Corinthians 5:1 Paul wrote, "There is fornication among you." Paul did not locate this sin in any individual believer; he located it in the church. He also said, "You are puffed up? And have you not rather mourned?" (1 Cor. 5:2). This sin was not just the sin of one member, but of the whole Body. Therefore, the shame was not just the shame of one member, but of the whole Body. Consequently, the mourning should not be just the mourning of one member, but of the whole Body. In church discipline we need to see the oneness of the Body of Christ and the potentiality as well as the fact of sin. We must first locate in ourselves the sin that is manifest in our brother, and not until we have judged it in ourselves should we dare judge it in him. By the grace of God we may not have committed the same act, but we have within us the same sin that provoked the act. If we express any personal sympathy when a brother has been excommunicated by the church, this is a clear indication that we have not judged that sin in ourselves.</p><h2 class="head1">INDIVIDUAL DISCIPLINE</h2><p>This type of discipline is exercised by individual Christians, and this discipline is a matter of simply avoiding the offender. "Turn away from them" (Rom. 16:17). "From these also turn away" (2 Tim. 3:5). "Keep away from every brother walking disorderly" (2 Thes. 3:6). There must be no element of personal grievance in this form of discipline, because even though it is relegated to the individual, it is never exercised on individual ground. The reason we are told to avoid certain classes of believers is because their intercourse with us is not only of no help to them, but is obviously of no help to us. It may even be distinctly harmful. By such intercourse there is no hope of gaining anything, and there is the possibility of losing much. It is a blessed situation indeed when a brother dealing with a brother, "fathers" dealing with "children," or the church dealing with an offending member proves effective in the restoration of the sinning one. However, when other modes of correction prove futile and there is no way of helping a brother, then he should be avoided lest he contaminate others. This form of discipline consists simply in steering clear of the offender. But let us again beware lest we adopt a "holier-than-thou" attitude.</p><p>This kind of discipline is exercised when sin has become clearly manifest. The discipline of the fathers is exercised when sin is still hidden. As a consequence, it is the most difficult form of discipline, but at the same time, it is also the most precious because it can hide a multitude of sins. We should not want to wait until sin comes to full fruition so that the church must deal with it openly. The fathers should nip it in the bud. Ninety percent of the work of recovery in the church lies in the hands of the fathers. Pity the local church that has no fathers! It will either have to excommunicate most of its members or be able to excommunicate none.</p><p>In the cases of discipline by the brothers and discipline exercised by the fathers, it is the individual who takes the initiative, not the church. If the brothers and the fathers would bear responsibility regarding the weaker members of the church, the necessity for excommunication would be obviated in many cases. If the individual shirks responsibility and waits for the church to act, it may be too late, for the church does not deal with sin until it is clearly manifest. The fathers deal with unexposed sin; the Son deals with exposed sin. Our Lord knew well who Judas was, but as the Son He could deal only with proven sin. Judas was under the discipline of the Father right up to the point when the Lord handed him the morsel. The measure of his iniquity was full by then; therefore, he came under the discipline of the Son at this point.</p><p>In closing let me emphasize the fact that discipline is always a remedial measure. The ultimate object of discipline is the recovery of the one disciplined. From the standpoint of the church, discipline is a matter of judgment; but from God's standpoint it is a means of recovery. Even if the church disciplines a member by delivering him over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, it is with the view "that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord" (1 Cor. 5:5). Where God's children are concerned, there is mercy in all His judgments; and when we judge any of His children on His behalf, whether we are acting as the whole church or as individuals, we should be full of mercy in our judgments. Even if the outward act is one of discipline, our inward attitude should be one of love.</p>
