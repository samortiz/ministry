   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BECOMING OUR SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sanctification is a much-debated topic today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As far as we know, all the teachings on sanctification take sanctification as a moral virtue, an act, or an inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They all consider sanctification to be a thing, an object.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a person has this kind of concept, it means that he does not know what it means for Christ to be our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some Christians have a natural concept concerning sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They think that sanctification is Christ coming to us and helping us become holy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What they are really saying is that they are not holy and that Christ is helping them to become holy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, 1 Corinthians 1:30 says that Christ Jesus became to us from God sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are not sanctified through ourselves or through the help of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, Christ Himself has become our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sanctification is in Christ, not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sanctification is the person of Christ, not the help of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Other Christians think that sanctification is Christ giving us the power to become sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, man can never be sanctified, and God has no intention to give man the power to become sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's Word tells us clearly that Christ Jesus became to us from God sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our sanctification is a gift, a person, not the result of some kind of empowering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only those who have seen this revelation can tell the difference between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only they can see the great distance between them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This revelation is not something that one can fathom with his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must ask God to show us something; we must see that Christ did not come to help us to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Neither did He come to give us the power to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, Christ Himself has become our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many Christians think that with sanctification there is a need for the power of sanctification on the one hand and a need to bear the fruit of sanctification on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They think that they will produce the fruit of sanctification if they have the power of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But where do they place Christ in this process?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most people say that Christ is necessary for power, because power will enable us to bear the fruit of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, 1 Corinthians 1:30 does not say that Christ is a power to empower us to sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, it says that Christ Himself is our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can have sanctification only after we have Christ, and we can have the fruit of sanctification only after we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers and sisters, we may consider sanctification to be a thing, but God's Word shows us that Christ is that very thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our sanctification is a living person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose I am a proud person with no humility whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can be aware of my pride, but I cannot humble myself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I may pray to God, saying, "Be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord Jesus, empower me and make me humble."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I think that I need the power of humility in order to be humble myself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If Christ helps me and empowers me, I think that I will surely become humble.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I pray and ask for help, but this is only my own concept.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not God's way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has not given us the power of humility, but humility itself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God has given us a perfected humility Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is the Lord powerful?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course He is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Has God given us this power?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Surely He has.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But why are we still so weak?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that the Lord's power is real, but this power is not accessible to us as a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if we can be humble and even if we can have a perfect performance, we only have an act of humility at the most.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Within us we still do not have humility itself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Humility is Christ Himself, not the power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should pray, "Lord, You are my humility.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God has made You my humility.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I ask that You live out Your humility from within me."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the right attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In asking the Lord to be our humility, we should lift up our head and say, "Lord, I have no humility of my own.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Be my humility and live out humility on my behalf."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we look to Him in this way, our humility will not be our own.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead the Lord will become our humility, and our humility will no longer be a conduct, but a living person Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I was young, I loved to watch slide projection shows at school.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After I believed in the Lord, the slide shows became a frequent illustration I used.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The light behind the slides never changes, but the slides change all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sometimes the light illuminates scenery, and sometimes it illuminates some kind of atmospheric phenomenon.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes the light illuminates landscapes, and sometimes it illuminates flowers and trees.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the same way all virtues are just the different expressions of Christ being reflected in us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Humility, meekness, and patience are not works that we do; they are virtues of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They are the very human virtues of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In fact, they are just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All the different virtues radiate from the one unchanging life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These different virtues are produced as a result of the many different kinds of environments.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hence, the virtues of a Christian are not different types of conduct, they are the result of Christ being reflected in him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the meaning of Christ being our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We do not need to manufacture a holiness of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Rather, we reflect Christ as holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Such a revelation and knowledge forms the basis of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Many Christians are striving to be humble, obedient, and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Little do they realize that they are not producing reflections of Christ, but "products" of their own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Actually, none of these virtues can be planned or manufactured.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When many Christians try to forgive, they pray for the Lord's strength.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then they try to muster their own strength to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Even then they find that they cannot forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have to see that when our forgiveness runs out, we should ask the Lord to be our forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should acknowledge that we cannot forgive in ourselves and that there is no forgiveness in us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should lift up our head and say to the Lord, "I have been wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I have tried to be a Christian on my own.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I will no longer do this.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Lord, I will allow You to live out of me."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The whole issue rests with the Lord Himself, not with you.</S>
