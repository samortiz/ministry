   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Today is Christ merely objective to you, or is He the subjective Christ to you?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have no doubt that Christ is in the heavens, and I can give you the Scripture verses which tell us this.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the New Testament also tells us many times that Christ is in us and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book of Ephesians mentions repeatedly that Christ is in us and we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I regret to say, however, that in today's Christianity there is a lot of talk about Christ in the heavens but very little talk about Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No matter how great the quantity is of good oranges in Southern California, they will not do you any good unless they get into your stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only the oranges which you have taken into your stomach are yours.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Similarly, no matter how good Christ is in the heavenlies, if He is not in you, He has nothing to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He must be subjective to you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You must have a subjective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some people may say that we need to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we need to consider whether we need to be balanced objectively or subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is too much of the objective Christ in Christianity today, but there is very little of the subjective Christ in you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to be balanced on the subjective side, not on the objective side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is already in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now there is a great need for you to receive Him into you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have to be balanced in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You do not have enough Christ within you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may have the gifts, but I wish to ask you, "How much Christ do you have today?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How much Christ do you have in your daily life and in your home?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must see that it is not good enough just to have an objective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of course, the objective side is the base.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we did not have any oranges in Southern California, we could not have an orange in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no doubt that we need the objective side.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But today there are millions of oranges in America, but how many oranges have we eaten?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to make the objective produce of America something subjective within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am not satisfied just to be here in America surrounded by the objective produce.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I want to put more and more American produce into my stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you just preach Christ in the heavens, it is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The objective Christ in the heavens has nothing to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must have Him come into you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more you know Christ in a subjective way, the more you will be satisfied with Him as the objective One.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now let us read some verses from the Scripture to see the subjective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 1:14 says, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 1 says that the Word was in the beginning, in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now the Word came in the flesh and is closer to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is not just in eternity but also in time; He is not just in divinity but also in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Notice the preposition used here is among.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He tabernacled among us, but was not yet in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Christ was in the flesh, the most He could do was to be among us; He could not be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John 14:16 says, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here it is not clear whether He is among us or in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It just says that He may be "with" us, which may mean that He is either among us or in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 17 says, "Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In you this is a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then verse 18 says, "I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This does not refer to His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If it did, that would mean that the Lord has left us as orphans for nearly two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the Lord did not do that.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 19 says, "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How long is "yet a little while"?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Just three days.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After He died, He came back right away in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He went away at the most for seventy-two hours; then He came back as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yet a little while and the world beholds Him no longer, but the disciples behold Him; because He lives by His resurrection, they also shall live by being raised up with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 20 says, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is very subjective.</S>
