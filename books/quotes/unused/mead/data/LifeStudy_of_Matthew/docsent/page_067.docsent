   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Regarding Murder 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Old Law Not to Murder</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 21 says, You have heard that it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The old law was the command not to murder.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What you have heard in verses 21, 27, 33, 38, and 43 is the law of the old dispensation; whereas what I say to you in verses 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, and 44 is the new law of the kingdom, complementing the law of the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Complementing Law</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not to Be Angry with the Brother,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not to Contemn the Brother,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>and Not to Condemn the Brother</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 22 the King said, But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the Sanhedrin; and whoever shall say, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder, but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the demand of the new law of the kingdom is deeper than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word brother in verse 22 proves that the King s word here is spoken to believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most difficult thing for us to do is to control our anger.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some were supposed to be very gentle, but their anger was like a wild horse when they lost their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When our anger is released, no one can bridle us or control us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For a number of years I could not get through this chapter because of the problem of my anger.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is also very difficult for us not to contemn or condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 22 the Lord speaks about saying to our brother, Raca, or Moreh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word Raca is an expression of contempt meaning stupid, good-for-nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreh, that is, fool, is a Hebrew expression of condemnation indicating a rebel Num 20:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This expression is more serious than the expression of contempt, Raca.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How difficult it is neither to condemn a brother nor to hold him in contempt!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps you cannot go for even a week without condemning or contemning someone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It seems that nearly every day we either contemn or condemn.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Husbands and wives contemn and condemn one another.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not believe there is one exception.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every wife has contemned and condemned her husband, and every husband has done the same to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a real problem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you read this, can you still say that you are the overcomers, the kingdom people?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Remember, we have an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you not have the King within you?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are the kingdom people, and we have the King within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This King is the kingly, overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do, you will be fully discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Forget yourself and look at the kingly life within you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is this life that makes us the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Forget your natural life and follow this kingly life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 22 there are three kinds of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first is the judgment at the gate of the city, which is the district judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The second is the judgment by the Sanhedrin, which is the higher judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Sanhedrin is a council composed of the chief priests, the elders, the lawyers, and the scribes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is the highest court of the Jews Luke 22:66; Acts 4:5-6, 15; 5:27, 34, 41 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The third is the judgment by God through the Gehenna of fire, which is the highest judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These three kinds of judgment were mentioned by the new King, using figures of the Jewish background, because all His audience was Jewish.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, concerning the kingdom people, the believers of the New Testament, all these judgments refer to the judgment of the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ, as revealed in 2 Corinthians 5:10; Romans 14:10, 12; 1 Corinthians 4:4-5; 3:13-15; Matthew 16:27; Revelation 22:12; and Hebrews 10:27, 30.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This clearly reveals that the New Testament believers, although forgiven by God forever, are still liable to the Lord s judgment, not for perdition, but for discipline, if they sin against the law of the kingdom as given here.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, when we sin against the new law of the kingdom, if we repent and confess our sins, we shall be forgiven and cleansed by the blood of the Lord Jesus 1 John 1:7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In verse 22 the new King speaks of the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word Gehenna is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew Ge Hinnom, valley of Hinnom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was a deep and narrow valley near Jerusalem, the refuse-place of the city, where the bodies of criminals and all kinds of filth were cast.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was also called Tophet, or Topheth 2 Kings 23:10; Isa 30:33; Jer 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because of its continual fire, it became the symbol of the place of eternal punishment, the lake of fire Rev 20:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This word is also used in Matthew 5:29, 30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15, 33; Mark 9:43, 45, 47; Luke 12:5; and James 3:6.</S>
