   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR TRANSFORMATION FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Both ends of the Bible contain many figures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are not merely printed words; they are pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we have to see their meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Adam was a man made of clay, the dust of the ground, but God put him in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Beside the tree of life there was the flowing river, and in the flow of the river there was not clay but gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually at the end of Genesis 2 there is a woman as a bride, not born but built by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This picture is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need the whole Bible to tell us what it signifies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This figure signifies that man, as the dust of the ground, a piece of clay, needs to be transformed to become gold, pearl, and precious stone to be built together to become a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The bride at the end of the Bible is a city built with gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is needed for this is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A piece of clay is not good for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The buildings of the enemy, Satan, are always with brick.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The tower of Babel in Genesis 11 and the two cities of Pharaoh in Exodus 1 were built with bricks made of burnt clay vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>11, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Pharaoh charged the people of Israel to gather straw and burn clay into bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's building, however, is always with stone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God does not need anything muddy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God needs gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to become these elements we have to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BEING TRANSFORMED BY EATING CHRIST AS THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way to be transformed is to take the tree of life into us, that is, to eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to our experience, when we take Jesus into us as the tree of life, something within us starts to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we take Jesus into us, we have a flow within.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now the tree of life is within us, and there is something flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may have the intention to go somewhere, but something may flow within us, telling us, "Do not go.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, rise, pray, and get prepared for the meeting tonight."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have such a flow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more it flows, the more life we have, and the "muddy" things within are transformed into something golden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are still "muddy," we need more flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we call, "O Lord Jesus," there is a flow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We receive the flowing not by teaching but by eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we eat Jesus, we have the river of life within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In John 6:57 Jesus said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me," and in 7:38 He said, "He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In John 6 there is the eating, and in chapter seven there is the flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the tree of life gets into us, it becomes the river.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This river flows within us, and this flow transforms us into gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all have to say, "Hallelujah for the transformation!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are not only regenerated, but we are also being transformed."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are not fully transformed yet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A brother may like to play basketball, but by transformation by the flowing of the life of Christ, his playing of basketball will cease.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Los Angeles in the past few years a number of hippies came to our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Night after night one such person would come with long hair, a beard, and bare feet to sit on the front row.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Another came wearing a dirty blanket-like garment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A dear saint warned me at that time that the church was in danger of becoming a "hippy church."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I told this one simply to wait; the Lord would work everything out.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Still, after several days and weeks I did expect to see that the brother would put away that blanket.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This was a real test to me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hallelujah, after a few months he did put away his blanket.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moreover, the brother with the long hair was cleanly shaven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When he walked into the meeting like this, everyone shouted for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, his feet were still bare.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For several more weeks I was still under the test.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I was tempted to give a message on dressing properly, but the Lord said within me, "Do not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not trust in teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Trust in Me. Trust in the flowing, the watering life, the transforming life." After not too long, this brother put on a pair of good shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This was transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Praise the Lord, we do have a transforming life.</S>
