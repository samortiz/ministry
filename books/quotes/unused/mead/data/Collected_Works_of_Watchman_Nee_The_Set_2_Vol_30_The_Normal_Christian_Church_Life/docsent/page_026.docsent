   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It was never God's purpose that a number of churches in different places should be combined under any denomination or organization, but rather that each one should be independent of the other.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Their responsibilities were to be independent and their government likewise.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When our Lord sent messages to His children in Asia, He did not address them as "the church in Asia," but "the seven churches which are in Asia."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His rebuke of Ephesus could not be applied to Smyrna, because Smyrna was independent of Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The confusion in Pergamos could not be laid to the charge of Philadelphia, because Philadelphia was independent of Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And the pride of Laodicea could not be attributed to Sardis, because Sardis was independent of Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Each church stood on its own merits and bore its own responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since God's children lived in seven different cities, they consequently belonged to seven different churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And since each was independent of the other, each had its own special commendation, or exhortation, or rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And not only were there these seven churches on earth; there were seven lampstands representing them in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Old Testament there was only one lampstand with seven different branches, but in the New Testament there were seven distinct lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Had the New Testament representation been the same as the Old, then believers in the seven Asiatic churches might have united to form one church; but there are now seven separate lampstands, each upon its own base, so that the Lord is able to walk "in the midst of the seven golden lampstands" Rev 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, though all churches stand under the authority of the one Head and express the life of the one Body for they are all made of gold , still they are not united by any outward organization, but each stands on its own base, bearing its own responsibility, maintaining its local independence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>AMONG THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This does not imply that the different local churches have nothing to do with one another, and that each can simply do as it pleases without considering the rest, for the ground of a church is the ground of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although they are unit-churches in outward management, still their inner life is one, and the Lord has made their members the members of one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no outward organization forming them into one big combined unit, but there is a strong inward bond uniting them in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They have a oneness of life which knows nothing of the bounds of locality, and which leads the separate churches to uniform action despite the absence of all outward organization.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In organization the churches are totally independent of one another, but in life they are one, and consequently interdependent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If one church receives revelation, the others should seek to profit by it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If one is in difficulty, the others should come to its aid.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But while the churches minister one to the other, they should always preserve their independence of government and responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, each church is directly under the authority of the Lord and responsible to Him alone; on the other hand, each must listen not only to His direct speaking, but to His speaking through the others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches," is our Lord's injunction to all Rev 2 and 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the introduction of His letters to the seven churches we find our Lord addressing the angel of each church, but at their close we find that His message to one particular church was also a message to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From this it is clear that what one church ought to do, all the churches ought to do.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The responsibility of the churches is individual, but their actions should be uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This balance of truth ought to be carefully preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We find the same teaching in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Because of this I have sent Timothy to you...who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church" 1 Cor 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What Paul has taught "everywhere in every church," the Corinthians are called upon to lay to heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is not one kind of instruction for Corinth, and another kind of instruction for another place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What the apostles have been teaching to some of the churches, the believers in other churches must also note.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And that applies to commandments as well as to matters of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"As the Lord has apportioned to each one...so let him walk.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And so I direct in all the churches" 1 Cor 7:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord could never give a command to one church which in any way contradicted His command to another church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His requirements for one group of His children were His requirements for all His children.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God" 1 Cor 11:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church in Corinth was apt to strike out on individual lines.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the other churches were going on together with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was only Corinth that was out of step; therefore, Paul sought to bring it into line with the others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today, alas! it is not just one church that has departed from God's way, but the majority of the so-called churches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a tragedy that today an injunction to follow "all the churches" would lead, not into, but away from, the will of God!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"Now concerning the collection for the saints, just as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also do" 1 Cor 16:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul is saying in effect, "Although you are independent of other churches, yet you must not disregard their example."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A willingness to help one another, and to learn from one another, should mark the relationship between the various churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What the more mature churches have learned from the Lord, the less experienced should be ready to learn from them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus," wrote Paul to the Thessalonians 1 Thes 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church in Thessalonica was younger than the churches in Judea; therefore, it was only fitting that they should learn from them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is a beautiful balance in the teaching of God's Word regarding the relationship between the various churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, they are totally independent of one another in matters relating to responsibility, government, and organization.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the other hand, they are to learn from one another and to keep pace with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But in everything it is essential to have both the guidance of the Holy Spirit and the pattern in God's Holy Word.</S>
