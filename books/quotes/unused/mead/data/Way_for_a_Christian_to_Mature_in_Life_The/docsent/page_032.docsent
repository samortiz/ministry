   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CHRISTIAN S MATURITY IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PURSUING THE FILLING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the beginning of our salvation we have the regenerating Spirit and God s life and nature in us, but we do not have the infilling of the Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have oil in our lamps, but we do not have oil prepared in our vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are shining, but the light in us may be going out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the way to mature in life?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The way to mature in life is to prepare oil in our vessels, that is, to pursue the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How do we pursue the filling of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, we must realize that the Spirit is the realization of Christ and that Christ is the embodiment of God 2 Cor 3:17; Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit in us is actually Christ in us and God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, the maturity in life is the growth of Christ in us, that is, our being occupied by Christ and filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, to be filled with the Spirit means that our entire being is occupied by Christ and filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our thoughts, preferences, views, insight, inclinations, choices, and everything are occupied by Christ and filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before we are completely filled, our views are our own views, our thoughts are our own thoughts, our preferences are our own preferences, and our choices are our own choices.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, everything comes out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ does not have any ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We love whatever we like, and we reject whatever we do not like.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is nothing of Christ s element in us, nor is there any ground for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our person remains intact.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the Spirit is in us, He may be suffering and may not have any ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Can we grow in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Can we mature, be made ready, and see the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No, we cannot mature unless we are willing to pursue the infilling of the Spirit, allowing Christ to occupy every part of us and allowing God to fill our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do so, then our whole being will be filled with Christ, and we will be mature and full-grown in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will be the same as Christ and will have His glorious image.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we can meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paying the Price to Buy</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How can we experience the infilling of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the parable of the ten virgins the Lord Jesus used a very good word buy Matt 25:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to have oil in our vessels we must buy, and to prepare oil in our vessels we must buy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that we have to buy in order to have the infilling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all understand that to buy something means to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No matter what we buy, we must spend money, that is, pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To buy clothes, food, groceries, or anything else, we have to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, how much we pay determines what kinds of things we can buy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ten dollars can buy you something valued at ten dollars, whereas ten thousand dollars can buy you something valued at ten thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, we can never gain the infilling of the Spirit without a cost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The infilling of the Spirit requires the paying of a price.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We often see saints praying in pursuit of the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to ask the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, please remember that we not only need to ask but also to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is useless to merely ask for the infilling of the Spirit before God and not buy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We definitely need to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is the price?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul says in Philippians 3, But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ....Brothers, I do not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>7-8, 13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Essentially, what Paul was saying was, I, Paul, am saved, and I am old now.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, I am imprisoned in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have followed the Lord for many decades, yet I am still forgetting the things that are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am counting all things as refuse that I may gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The price that Paul paid was the price of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In return, what Paul received was Christ.</S>
