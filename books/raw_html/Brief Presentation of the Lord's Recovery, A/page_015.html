<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Believers Having Been Crucified with Christ,<br>Being Terminated in Their Old Man</H2><P>The believers have been crucified with Christ, being terminated in their old man (Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Believers Having Christ Living in Them as<br>the Pneumatic Christ, the Spirit, Indwelling Them</H2><P>The believers have Christ living in them as the pneumatic Christ, the Spirit, indwelling them (Rom. 8:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Believers Having Been<br>Sanctified Positionally by the Blood of Christ<br>and Being Sanctified Dispositionally<br>by the Spirit, That They May Be Renewed,<br>Transformed in Their Soul, Conformed<br>to the Image of the Firstborn Son of God,<br>and Glorified in Their Body in the Glory<br>of the Processed Triune God</H2><P>The believers have been sanctified positionally by the blood of Christ (Heb. 13:12) and are being sanctified dispositionally by the Spirit (Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22), that they may be renewed, transformed in their soul (Rom. 12:2a; 2 Cor. 3:18), conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29), and glorified (redeemed) in their body (Rom. 8:23) in the glory of the processed Triune God (Rom. 8:30, 17-18). Although the believers have been regenerated in their spirit, their soul and body remain old. Thus, the believers need to be renewed, transformed in their soul, conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God, and glorified in their body in the glory of the processed Triune God. The believers are tripartite beings composed of spirit, soul, and body. First, their spirit is regenerated, then their soul is transformed, and finally, their body will be glorified. Thus the believers' whole being will be saturated with God's splendid life. God's life is a life of splendor, and that splendor is the glory of the divine life. When we are permeated, saturated, and soaked with the splendor of the divine life, we will be in glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Believers Being Saturated<br>with the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity<br>in Their Tripartite Being, So That They Are<br>Mingled with the Processed Triune God</H2><P>The believers are saturated with the dispensing of the divine Trinity in their tripartite being (Rom. 8:5-11), so that they are mingled with the processed Triune God.</P>
