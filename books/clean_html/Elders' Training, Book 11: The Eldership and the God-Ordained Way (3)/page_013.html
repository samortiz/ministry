<P>Brother Nee testified that he received much help from Sister M.E. Barber, who rebuked him often. She was very deep in the Lord and had especially learned the lesson of the subjective cross of Christ. She learned the lesson of bearing the cross, and she learned the lesson of praying and of living in the light of the Lord's appearing. However, her shortcoming was in the matter of frankness and rebuking. Although she was in China for many years, only one person, Watchman Nee, was raised up through her. According to Brother Nee, there were over twenty young people under her care, but eventually nearly all left. Only Brother Nee continued to return to her to be rebuked.</P><P>The problems in a church are often related to the elders, and most of the problems related to the elders arise from the elders' negative spirit, attitude, and tone toward others. It is very difficult not to have a negative spirit. Our spirit, attitude, tone, and gesture may all offend people. Therefore, the elders should be grave, having a weightiness that inspires and invites honor. This depends upon their spirit, attitude, tone, and gesture. Even our listening to people without responding to them properly may offend them. The elders should learn the proper way to listen to others and to respond to them. Not responding properly to people comes from a negative spirit.</P><P>The elders must be happy persons with a joyful spirit, always humble, mild, and easy to contact. No one on earth is perfect. Everyone needs the Lord. Therefore, regardless of what someone says, the elders should not be bothered by that person. They must realize that this person needs the Lord, and they must be happy with him and try to give him an "injection" of Christ. This is to dispense Christ into this person.</P><P>An elder must be full of discernment; he should not be foolish or dull. However, he should discern without criticizing, despising, and judging. This is not easy. He must have a keen feeling about others, but he should not criticize or despise them. It is wrong to have a despising attitude toward someone because we know him well. Even if an elder knows others' shortcomings, he must not criticize, despise, or judge them. The elder himself also has shortcomings. In this sense, he is the same as the others; it is simply a matter of degree. The elders should realize that they have their own mistakes. They have to turn their eyes upon themselves and consider themselves. They are not qualified to condemn or judge. However, by their appointment, the elders have been put into a position in which it is easy to criticize, despise, and judge, and because they are in such a position, it is easy for others to criticize them. These are the snares, the traps, which Satan has set around the elders. Almost no elder can escape these traps. It is difficult to be an elder in a local church for several years without being trapped by these snares.</P><P>The elders should contact people in a way that is full of love, concern, and sympathy in a meek and humble spirit (Gal. 6:1), not in a way to convince, to catch, to arrest, but to recover, to bring people back to the Lord. Their contact should be with the full realization that what the people need is the Lord and what can solve the people's problems is to meet with the Lord. In their contact with others, they should avoid a superiority complex, argument, offense, or any form of humiliation, always remembering well that the church is neither a police station nor a law court, and that we are neither the policemen nor the judges.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MINISTERING CHRIST TO MEET THE NEED<br>OF EVERY KIND OF PERSON</H2><P>In their contact with people, the elders should minister Christ to meet the need of every kind of person (Eph. 3:8; Col. 1:28). They must seek a way to get people to open to them. They must also find the proper utterance to touch people's spirit and catch the proper time to dispense Christ, either with a quotation from the Bible or a word of their inspiration. Lastly, they must stir up people's hunger and thirst to seek the Lord by praying with them (John 4:15).</P>
