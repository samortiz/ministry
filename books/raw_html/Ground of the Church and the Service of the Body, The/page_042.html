	 <h2 class="head1">OUR MOVE NEEDING TO HAVE A DIRECTION<br />
AND BE MULTIDIRECTIONAL</h2>
<p>There are two basic principles for our move: one is that our move must have a direction, and the other is that our move must be multidirectional. The four living creatures go straightforward in four directions without turning (Ezek. 1:17). They are not without a definite direction; rather, they go straight ahead, yet they are able to move in every direction. This means that when we move, we must have a goal, a direction, without preference and without turning according to our will. However, we should not move in more than one direction. We cannot say, &ldquo;I only care about one matter; I do not care about any other matter.&rdquo; Likewise, we cannot say, &ldquo;I am taking care of visitation, so I cannot give a message or preach the gospel.&rdquo; If this is the case, we are not like the four living creatures. We are &ldquo;one-directional&rdquo;; that is, if we can go east, we cannot go west.</p>
<p>Every serving one should learn to have an aim, a direction, and to be multidirectional. Even though our particular direction may be to preach the gospel, we may discover that when we are speaking in a meeting the attendants need edification, not the gospel. When this occurs, we should change the meeting to take care of the matter of edification. This is what it means to have an aim but to also be multidirectional. It may be that we are responsible for giving messages, but we should also be able to visit people. Perhaps we work with young people and students; nevertheless, we should also be able to speak with older saints and render help to them. Our focus may be to work with young people, but we should also be able to work in other areas. We must be able to cover multiple directions and be flexible in our work. We should be able to give a message as well as visit someone. We should be able to preach the gospel as well as edify others. If we are persons who pay attention to the inner life, we should also be able to encourage others to preach the gospel. This is what it means to be multidirectional instead of &ldquo;one-directional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to their disposition, some brothers do not like to talk. If such brothers desire to serve the Lord, they need to allow themselves to be broken in this matter. Other brothers like to talk when they meet people; however, this too is natural and fleshly. We should follow the sense of the spirit to either keep quiet or speak. Often, however, we are quiet because we are afraid that we will not supply others or we feel that we cannot speak well, not because in our spirit we feel to be quiet. Hence, in order to train ourselves to be able to supply others, we cannot have an indifferent attitude. We should let the responsibility that we bear press us, just as Paul was pressed: &ldquo;Who is stumbled, and I myself do not burn?&rdquo; (2 Cor. 11:29). Many brothers and sisters are coming to the meetings. If we do not supply them, who will? We must do our best to make up the lack. God will open up our stuttering mouth and give us the gift of speaking, and the Spirit will grant us grace.</p>
<p>If we do not turn on the faucet, the water company cannot supply us with water. Similarly, we are often unable to supply others, because we are accustomed to not opening our mouth, we adhere to our routines, and we are set in our ways. Wherever the Spirit goes, the wheels follow. We should not make a rule that we will not open our mouth in the meetings. Although we should have a direction for our service and should not turn at will, we must also be multidirectional. The requirement of being multidirectional is a difficult lesson for us to learn. Actually, to adhere to a routine is to be presumptuous. After our presumptuousness has been broken, we will receive a great deal of perfecting. If there is a need to give a gospel message, even if we have never learned to give a gospel message, we have no choice but to give a gospel message. If we pick up certain matters, we will learn. In the same way, if we always give gospel messages, yet there is a need for edification, will we be willing to meet the need? If we are not willing, who will do it? Surely this is our responsibility, and we must learn to pick it up.</p>
