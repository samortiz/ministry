   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPER WAY BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these days our attention is focused on the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must spend time in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the pastors and preachers in Christianity today know that it is very difficult to help believers lead a life of constant fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, two methods have been developed in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One is to have a Sunday morning worship service to sustain the people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During the week very few people go to church meetings; most of them go only on Sunday for a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The preachers or pastors prepare a sermon for them each week.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition, at least twice a year there may be some so-called revival meetings or retreats.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through these revival meetings or retreats they try to stir up the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Most of the fundamental Christian churches depend on this method to maintain themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The other method is that of the Pentecostal movement with its tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This group considers the fundamental Christians too dead; they use the Pentecostal gifts, especially tongue-speaking, to stir up the people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From 1932 on I began to attend their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After many decades of observation and experience, I have the confidence to say that most of today s so-called speaking in tongues is false.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The tongue-speaking mentioned in the book of Acts and in 1 Corinthians is a real dialect Acts 2:4, 6, 8, 11; 1 Cor 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not like what the tongue-speakers of today practice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most of today s tongue-speaking is only a kind of nonsensical sound; it is not a dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have a brother among us who is a scholar in linguistics.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He told us that today the most simple language in the world is the Hawaiian language; but even this language has at least thirteen consonants.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the tongue-speakers can produce at most only ten consonants.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This proves that the so-called Pentecostal gift of tongues today is not a real dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the summer of 1963 I was conducting a training in Pasadena.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time tongue-speaking was quite prevailing on the West Coast.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I read a report by a pastor who was very much in favor of tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He said that he had contacted two hundred tongue-speakers, and every one of them told him that they doubted that their speaking in tongues was genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After that the pastor exhorted the readers not to doubt their tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All they needed to do was to speak; it was all right for them to speak anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said that as long as they could speak something, that was a tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the training I asked a brother to read aloud the article to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After that I asked them, On the day of Pentecost when the apostles spoke in tongues, did any one of them doubt that his was a real tongue?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why is it that today, of the two hundred mentioned in this article who speak in tongues, all doubt their genuineness?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This proves that their tongues are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some are not happy unless they speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They must shout and cry before they feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At first I did not understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Gradually, I found out that even an unbeliever when he is depressed can experience an emotional release by shouting a little; he does not need to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I remember that as a child in my hometown I watched the carpenters and the bricklayers build houses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They kept themselves busy from morning until evening.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When it was time for them to stop to eat, they threw their tools aside, waved their arms around, and shouted some nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this way they felt relieved and refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Concerning the tongue-speaking of today, I would say that most of it, if not all, is false.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, the principle which tongue-speakers apply is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The principle of tongue-speaking is to open people s mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To close our mouth is to be shut up, and to open our mouth is to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a person is angry, if he is a cultured man he will shut up and not speak anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will give him an ulcer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are angry but have no way to vent your anger, just go out into the yard and shout, Oh, heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is unfair!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then sing some songs, or recite a poem, and your anger will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You do not need to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It will be just as effective if you shout like the heathens do.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A brother read in some books that even in ancient Egypt and Babylon, a kind of tongue-speaking was practiced in the places of idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is a brother among us from Ghana in Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He told me that when he was young, while he was still an unbeliever, he saw the idol worshippers speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The reason I have mentioned all these things is to advise you not to take the way of tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not take this short cut.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Tongue-speaking is like a tide; it comes in fast, and it goes out fast.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Pentecostal tongue-speaking movement began roughly in the middle of the nineteenth century in England.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By now nearly a century and a half has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Historically, very few churches or Christian groups have been definitely built up through tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Assembly of God is the most solid group among the tongue-speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They told their seminary students clearly that they cannot depend on tongues to build up the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To build up churches, the only way is by teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They can speak in tongues in private, but in their meetings they do not speak in tongues.</S>
