   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The history of God's dealing with man is almost the same as the history of His covenants with man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God has put man into the covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He put Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, and all past and present believers into the covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The whole Bible is the covenants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the blessings that God gave to Noah, Abraham, David, etc., are all contained in the covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He has put all the blessings to the Jews and to the present-day believers into the covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this way man will no longer doubt Him, but believe in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is willing to be bound and lose His freedom by entering into covenants with man because of our weakness and unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All that we need to do is ask and enjoy according to the deed of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After Solomon completed the building of the temple, he realized that God had made a covenant with his father David, and he prayed that God would accomplish the words He promised with His own mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Solomon took hold of the word that God had provided and asked God to accomplish what He had promised.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now, we have the new covenant that God has established with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All we have to do is ask God to fulfill in us what He has promised according to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is great, infinite, and seemingly untouchable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We dare not draw near to Him and do not know how to pray to Him because He is so great.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, He has limited Himself to the covenants, so that we can draw near to Him, pray to Him, claim from Him, and speak to Him according to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only when we know the greatness and riches of the new covenant will we realize the vastness of God's love and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the covenants, how could we bargain with God and speak to Him according to the words of the covenants?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God has not been gracious to us, how can there be the covenants?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If only we will have a small, feeble, and weak faith, it will be like the little candlelight that flickers before the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we can lay hold of God's handle in His Word, and God will answer us and fulfill all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Remember the word in the book of Isaiah which says, "Put Me God in remembrance" Isa 43:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This seems to indicate that, like us, God tends to forget; we have to remind Him, so that He will remember.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we pray and have not received, we should remind God saying, "Have You forgotten the covenant You made with me?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please give according to what You have said."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you do this, you will surely receive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This word is only to those who know the Lord in a deep way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hebrews 13:20-21 says, "Now the God of peace, He who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant, perfect you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ; to Him be the glory forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a written prayer of a believer, one of the greatest prayers in the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It says that God will do in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What a great prayer this is!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He asks God "in the blood of an eternal covenant."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He stands upon the eternal covenant of God and asks God, according to the covenant which He made when He brought up the Lord Jesus from the dead, that the Lord Jesus would live in us, and that we can do the things that are well pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A great prayer is none other than a request that is based on the eternal covenant which was established by the shedding of the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should have the faith which allows us to stand on the covenant and prays by clinging to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Based on the covenant, we should say to God, "God, I am now praying to You according to the handle that I lay hold of in Your Word."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This kind of prayer is powerful and effective.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we believe in the covenant, we will be strengthened and emboldened to pray to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, what kind of prayers are based on the covenant?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The prayer by the writer of Hebrews is one of these prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are many other prayers in the Bible like this one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Unfortunately, no one today prays to God according to the letter of the covenant, and no one asks God to give to him the riches promised in Christ so that he can glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Finally, remember that you have the firm right to pray to God according to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You can ask God to act according to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You can say to God, "You have covenanted with me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please accomplish for me according to the covenant."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have to repeat again that without faith, you can pray all you want and nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God can only do so much.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose a friend says to you, "I have deposited a great deal of money in the bank in your name.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here is the check.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever you want the money, just sign your name and withdraw the money from the bank."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you do not move your hand to sign the check, you will not get the money.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The blame will be on you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God can only cause the Lord Jesus to come to earth, be crucified, shed His blood to enact the new covenant, and allow you to bargain with Him according to this covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you do not exercise your faith to claim and apply, these things will not have any effect on you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I can frankly say that many believers do not have any faith at all.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Not only are backsliding and cold believers lacking in faith, even Christians whom others consider to be very zealous are also lacking in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They all pray according to their own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They think that as long as they repent and do good, God will surely answer their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some think that as long as they promise God that they will repent and try their best to be good and proper Christians, God will answer their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today we have seen the basis of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>May we rise up and exercise our faith to lay hold of all these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Tomorrow, we will speak on the sphere and contents of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We will also speak on the three main parts of the new covenant.</S>
