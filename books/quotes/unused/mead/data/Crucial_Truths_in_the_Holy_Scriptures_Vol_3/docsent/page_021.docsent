   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOME IMPORTANT POINTS REGARDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL Praying</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In prayer and in the ministry of the word Acts 6:4; see also 4:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are some important matters that we must pay attention to in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first matter is prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to preach the gospel, we must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A person who preaches the gospel must be a person who prays.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Merely preaching the gospel is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Prayer must accompany the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes we cannot release the word of God through ministry, but we can release it through prayer; sometimes we cannot speak the word of God into people, but we can pray it into them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must have sufficient prayer to lead, accompany, and follow our gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not have many outward activities that have only a minimal amount of prayer behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And...Philip ran up Acts 8:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Philip preached the gospel to the Ethiopian eunuch in response to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we preach the gospel, we should learn to follow the Holy Spirit as we move.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must follow the leading of the Holy Spirit concerning whom to visit and what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, when the brothers and sisters preach the gospel, they often visit people in a loose way and say the same thing to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who receive our gospel speaking should be chosen by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The words of our gospel speaking should also be chosen by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When D. L. Moody was preaching the gospel in a certain place, a man came to him after the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moody had the leading to ask him if he had peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He angrily said that he had peace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moody said, My God says that an evil man shall not have peace!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The man went home, and the Holy Spirit used this word to work in him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more he considered his situation, the less peace he had.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The next day he went to see Moody and said, Yesterday, when I told you that I had peace, I was lying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After I went home, I felt deeply within that I did not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moody then brought him to know the Lord and His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word that Moody spoke was not some customary word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He spoke the word that the Holy Spirit directed him to speak in that instant, so it was a living, powerful word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should pay attention to, pursue, and learn how to be led by the Spirit in the matter of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Speaking the Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Speak the word of God Acts 4:31; see also Luke 1:37; Jer 23:29; Eph 6:17; Heb 4:12; Isa 55:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word of God is powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It can burn and melt like fire, and it can break and conquer like a great hammer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It can pierce and divide like a sharp sword, and it can water and refresh like rain and snow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Wherever it goes, it never returns in vain; rather, it always accomplishes God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we preach the gospel, we must speak the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our message should be the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The content of our message should include words from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is effective.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Charles H. Spurgeon once preached the gospel at the Crystal Palace in London.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before the event he tested the acoustics of the building by standing on the stage and shouting the words in John 1:29: Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A carpenter who was working in the galleries heard the word, believed, and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A. Paget Wilkes, who was much used by the Lord, once spoke at an outdoor gospel meeting in Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While he was speaking, he shouted 1 Corinthians 1:18: The word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A Japanese man heard this word as he was going past the meeting place to a bad part of town to engage in sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His heart was moved, and he stopped to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eventually, he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are many examples like this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, in our gospel preaching we must learn to use the words from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must become familiar with the words of the Bible in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we will be able to use them at the appropriate time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Preaching the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Preach...Christ Jesus as Lord ; Taught accurately the things concerning Jesus 2 Cor 4:5; Acts 18:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we preach the gospel, we should preach nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not preach Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christianity cannot save people; only Christ can.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ should be the topic and the center of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should preach Christ Jesus as Lord and tell others the things concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should bring others to know Him, believe in Him, receive Him, turn to Him, and confess Him as their Savior and Lord of all.</S>
