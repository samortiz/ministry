<p>We receive all the truth that God has recovered in the church throughout the ages, but we do not receive blindly; we receive with discernment. Just as we receive Madame Guyon&rsquo;s spirituality but not Catholicism and Andrew Murray&rsquo;s revelation but not denominational organization, we receive Brother Austin-Sparks&rsquo;s spirituality, but he must give us freedom concerning the practicality of the ground of the church. Otherwise, it will make things very difficult for us. Our situation shows that after our brother&rsquo;s visit, things have indeed been very difficult, and I regret this. If the co-workers had stayed within their measure, I would have no regrets. Unrest and chaotic situations have prevented us from advancing.</p>
<p>According to Brother Austin-Sparks, the building can take place anywhere as long as there is spiritual material; that is, as long as there is gold, silver, and precious stones that issue from Christ, the building can take place anywhere. This is not the truth that we see. Although gold, silver, and precious stones are the right materials, the building must take place on Mount Moriah. Any building not on Mount Moriah is wrong even if it is built with the same materials and according to the same pattern. Although we are in Christ and are of Christ, only building on the local ground is right; building on the ground of doctrine or practice is wrong, and building on the ground of the two or three gathered together is even more wrong. This is the truth in the Bible and our view.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I am displeased with what our brother said, but on the other hand, our fellowship did not cease. When I was in the United States, an experienced brother whom I had never met came to see me. He had a question regarding house churches. He had no problem with the local churches but asked how I explain the church in the house of Aquila and Prisca (1 Cor. 16:19). I pointed out that when Aquila and Prisca were in Ephesus, the church in Ephesus gathered in their house (Acts 18:18-19, 26) and that when they were in Rome, the church in Rome gathered in their house (Rom. 16:3, 5). After my explanation, he asked concerning my fellowship with Brother Austin-Sparks. I told him that even though Brother Austin-Sparks and I do not hold the same view concerning the ground, our fellowship had not ceased. Even though Paul was Peter&rsquo;s junior, when he saw that Peter was wrong, he opposed him to his face (Gal. 2:11). Even though Brother Austin-Sparks and I disagree concerning the ground, we have always maintained fellowship.</p>
<p>The ground of the church is very important. If we do not have the ground, why should we gather together? There are many Christian groups. What need is there to form more gatherings? There are many positive things in the Christian groups. We are not saying that we are spiritual by insisting on the ground. In many regards we cannot compare with other Christians. We gather outside the many Christian groups because of the ground. A person who wants to build a house must have a definite site on which to build. Likewise, besides having the right materials and pattern, there needs to be a definite ground in order to build the church. This is indicated in the Old Testament by the building site for the temple&mdash;the threshing floor of Ornan.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would have a clear vision concerning the building. If we fail in this point, we will commit a serious error. It is not a matter of having good or bad intentions or of doing something purposely or accidentally but a matter of committing a serious error. The work among us has suffered loss because of this. Hence, we need a clear vision to know what our attitude toward Brother Austin-Sparks should be. We need to be clear concerning what we should receive and hold fast. We need to know the pattern for the building, know what materials can be used, and know the ground for the building. If we are not definite regarding the ground, things will be difficult. If some hold differing opinions and cannot accept the truth concerning the ground, then we need to fellowship. Please do not pass on rumors that trouble the saints. I can lead only those who are one. I cannot lead those who give an uncertain sound of the trumpet (1 Cor. 14:8). This matter concerns the co-workers. May the Lord have mercy on us so that each of us will be clear.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Blueprint and the Ground for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
