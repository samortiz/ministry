<p class="bold">WEEK 7 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 10:16-17, 19-21, 24-25</h2><p class="bold">16 &nbsp;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be therefore prudent as serpents and guileless as doves.</p><p class="bold">17 &nbsp;And beware of men, for they will deliver you up to sanhedrins, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.</p><p class="bold">19 &nbsp;But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you should speak, for it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak;</p><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;For you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.</p><p>21 &nbsp;And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death.</p><p>24 &nbsp;A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above his master.</p><p>25 &nbsp;It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of His household!</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The Lord’s word in Matthew 10 is a word spoken to the sent ones. In 10:16—11:1 many things are brought to the surface. By seeing these things, we will be able to understand the situation in which we find ourselves today.</p><p>In verses 16 and 17 the Lord predicted the persecution that would come from Judaism upon His apostles.…Even the Jewish nation had been fully taken over by God’s enemy.…The Lord spoke of persecution coming from the Sanhedrin and the synagogues. The Sanhedrin was the highest council among the children of Israel. The Sanhedrin’s function was to see that the Jews followed the law of the Old Testament. The synagogue was a place where the Word of God was taught to the children of Israel. It is very significant that the Lord exposed the Sanhedrin and the synagogues as being opposed to God’s economy. He said that His apostles, His sent ones, would be delivered up to sanhedrins and scourged in the synagogues. A synagogue…in a sense…was a holy place, a place where the holy Word of God was taught to God’s people.…By this we see what an evil thing the synagogue had become.…In our experience throughout the years, nearly all the persecution, rumors, opposition, and attack have come from the religious organizations, not from the Gentiles.</p><p>The apostles have not only the authority of the heavenly King (v. 1) but also the Spirit of their Father [v. 20]. The King’s authority deals with the unclean spirits and diseases; the Father’s Spirit deals with the opposers’ persecution.…As long as we have the Spirit of the Lord, we have the presence of the Lord. The presence of the Lord is the Spirit for speaking. We should learn to face persecution not in ourselves, but learn to turn to our spirit and trust in the indwelling Spirit.</p><p>Those who would be the heavenly King’s apostles for the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom must suffer the breaking of the closest human ties [v. 21].</p><p>In verse 24…according to the context, the word here means that in suffering persecution His apostles cannot be above Him, because He was persecuted to the uttermost. Verse 25 says, “It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of His household!” Beelzebub meaning the lord of the flies, was the name of the god of the Ekronites (2 Kings 1:2). It was changed contemptuously by the Jews to Beelzebul, which means the lord of the dunghill, and was used for the ruler of the demons (12:24, 27; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15, 18-19). In 9:34 the Pharisees, the leading ones of the Jewish religion, reviled the heavenly King by saying that He cast out demons by the ruler of demons. In using this most blasphemous name, they expressed their strongest objection and rejection.
