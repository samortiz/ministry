<h2 class="head2">Our Work in China Today</h2><p>If we want to keep up with God's work, we must pay attention to three matters concurrently.</p><h2 class="head3">Preaching the Gospel</h2><p>Preaching the gospel is the beginning of God's work. If there is no gospel preaching in a place, there is surely no start to the work of God. Preaching the gospel is also the spread of God's work. If we want God's work to spread and the kingdom of God to increase in any place, we must preach His gospel. Furthermore, preaching the gospel is also the continuation of God's work. If no one on earth preached the gospel for twenty to forty years, I am afraid God's work on earth would stop completely.</p><p>The wider we spread the gospel, and the more thoroughly and fiercely we preach it, the better it is. It would be wonderful if we could become crazy for the gospel's sake. We are not afraid that the brothers and sisters would become too zealous in preaching the gospel. In every church we should encourage the brothers and sisters to "spend and be utterly spent on behalf of...souls" (2 Cor. 12:15). Every church should have burning gospel meetings. The brothers and sisters should all be burning in bringing relatives, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates to hear the gospel. We should saturate the homes, schools, businesses, factories, prisons, restaurants, boats, trains, airplanes, buses, trams, ferries, piers, stations, parks, public places, large streets, little alleys, and any other places with the voices and footsteps of brothers and sisters who are preaching the gospel every day. We should pass out gospel tracts, pictures, books, and other publications in large quantities and in every place. It would also be wonderful if many brothers could be raised up to put up gospel banners in every place or gospels ads and neon lights in every town and city, along the railroads and highways, at the piers and stations, and in ships and buses. We are not afraid that the brothers and sisters would become too much in the matter of preaching the gospel. We only fear that they would not do enough!</p><h2 class="head3">Bringing in Revival</h2><p>In every local church there should be genuine revivals. The brothers and sisters should all zealously love the Lord and consecrate themselves absolutely to live for Him. They should all drop the world and have the reality of "giving up" and "selling all," as recorded in the four Gospels and Acts.</p><p>If a local church has only the gospel without any revival, it is definitely short. If there is no revival, the gospel has no power. The power for preaching comes from one's sacrifice of the world. The more we give up the world, the greater our power in the gospel will be. If we are willing to give up everything and sell all, the gospel will be a gospel of authority in our mouths. If we are like Lot, living in today's Sodom, it should be no surprise that our relatives consider our gospel as a mockery, just like Lot's sons-in-law (Gen. 19:14).</p><p>Furthermore, without revival, it is inevitable that we will have problems with spiritual pursuit and knowledge of life. We cannot be lazy in our pursuit of spirituality and our knowledge of life. We must realize that the knowledge of life depicted in the Epistles comes after "giving up" and "selling all" in the four Gospels and Acts. The knowledge of life has to do with resurrection; "giving up" and "selling all" have to do with the cross. If we do not pass through the cross, we cannot experience any resurrection. If there is no "giving up" and "selling all," it is difficult to have the knowledge of life. If we do not have the reality of "giving up" and "selling all," not only is our gospel void of power and a mockery to others, but our spiritual pursuit and interest in life, to a considerable extent, become a kind of recreation and high-class entertainment. Therefore, we must have genuine revivals before our gospel can be powerful and our experience of life real.</p><h2 class="head3">Pursuing the Knowledge of Life</h2><p>In a local church there should be the zeal for the gospel, the reality of revival, and the knowledge of life. We should not stop at the gospel; nor should we stop with revival. Revival, like the gospel, is not God's goal; it is merely God's means to bring us to life. We should advance from the stage of the gospel to the stage of revival, and from the stage of revival to life. Only life is God's goal. The gospel gives us life, revival removes the hindrances to the knowledge and growth of life, and life brings us to God's goal.</p><p>The knowledge of life means the knowledge of God as life within us through the working of His grace (Col. 3:4). It means the knowledge of living by His life (Gal. 2:20), the knowledge of abiding in this life, and the knowledge of living out this life (Phil. 1:20-21).</p><p>The goal of God's salvation is to make us His vessels (Rom. 9:23-24). He put Himself as the "treasure" within us, the vessels (2 Cor. 4:7). From the time we were saved, God has been working on us continually to put more of Himself deeply into us so that we might gradually become lost in Him. This results in a deeper union in life with Him, which ultimately reaches perfection.</p><p>The goal of life is to bring God into man so that man may become lost in God. In this way, God and man, man and God become perfectly one.</p><p>We should pay equal attention to the three preceding matters. We should not emphasize one at the expense of another. If we emphasize these three matters equally, our work will go on in a stable and solid way. These three matters together make up a three-strand rope. If the strands are all of the same thickness, the rope will be very strong.</p>
