   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, this does not mean that we only have to adopt an attitude of looking to God, believing in God, and waiting and trusting in God, when we come before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our attitude alone cannot replace God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps after some brothers and sisters hear a message on the cross, they change their attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They may say, "In the future I have to learn to be more humble and gentle before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the future when I work, I have to learn to rely on Him more."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even this does not mean they have the sign of death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to realize that the cross is God's work upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day the Lord will enlighten us in His mercy, and through this enlightening, we will be crushed and an eternal mark will be left upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From that day on, we may still move, but every time we move, we will feel the pain and the absence of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A day will come when the cross does its work on us, and we will no longer please God according to our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, it is useless to have a mere change in our attitude; what is needed is the true experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person may try to change his attitude, but it will not last long, and he will soon forget the change.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When something happens he will become bold in himself again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When others say a few words of praise to him, his face will shine again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When his work is making good progress, he will feel as if he is treading on the clouds again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the use of having just a change in attitude?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is useless to have the attitude of the cross without the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There must first be the experience of the cross before there can be the attitude of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul said, "And I was...in weakness and in fear and in much trembling" 1 Cor 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was a person who knew the cross, so he could have the attitude of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we pretend to be in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling, this will go away in a few days and be forgotten even by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is easy for us to have the right attitude and the right message, without the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When this happens, we will easily forget about the whole matter after some time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once a brother said, "I used to preach the cross, but for some unknown reason I have not touched this subject for the last ten months."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is this surprising?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No. If it is only a subject, it will soon be forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If God has done a work on me and touched me, I will spontaneously become a weak person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I will not have to try to be a weak person; I will be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I will not have to imitate Paul and be in fear and trembling; I will be in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There will be a sign of the cross on me, and I will be changed into another person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is having an offering before God, and this is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was the experience of Jacob at Peniel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He limped because his thigh was crippled, and he remained this way for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet many Christians do not suffer a wound after falling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They fall repeatedly, but after getting up they can still run.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before they fall they are one kind of person, and after they rise up they are still the same kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when the cross does its work on such a person, he will fall and not be able to get up again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When he finally gets up, no matter how hard he tries, he will not act the same way as before; there will be an indelible mark on him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From that point on, even if he wants to be great, he will be unable to try.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A Christian who is truly touched by God finds no heart for his own idea; he cannot be proud even if he tries.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God has done a work in him, and he makes his offering through this work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the meaning of death, and this is the meaning of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In conclusion, we must repeat that the cross is not a mere doctrine or teaching; it is God's enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once God enlightens us, we can no longer live as we did before.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Men like Peter, John, and Paul in the New Testament and Job, Jacob, Daniel, Isaiah, and Ezekiel in the Old Testament all experienced a one-time intense enlightening from God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After they saw the light, they could no longer live as they did before, and their lives could never be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God's light exposes the self, we will no longer live the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We will realize that nothing from ourselves pleases God and that we can only prostrate ourselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we will serve God according to this cross, not serving by the flesh and not trusting in our own works; we will serve by the Holy Spirit and trust in God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May the Lord deliver us from mere doctrines, and may the cross truly work on us so that we may make an offering which is acceptable to Him and become a person who is acceptable to Him.</S>
