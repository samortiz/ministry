   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SELF BEING THE GREATEST PROBLEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the self is something independent, the self is the greatest problem to the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should be dependent not only on God but also on the Body, on the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we are independent of the brothers and sisters, we are in the self, in the independent soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For us today, being independent of the Body is equal to being independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a matter not of doctrine but of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you check with your experience, you will realize that when you were independent of the brothers and sisters, you had the sense that you were also independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, when you were isolated from the brothers and sisters, you had the sense that you were also isolated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When some hear this, they may say, "Isn't the Lord omnipresent?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the Lord is everywhere, I can have His presence anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I can have the Lord's presence in my home or in any other place."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, having the Lord's presence depends on whether or not you are dependent on the Body and are rightly related to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are rightly related to the Body, you will have the Lord's presence in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if you are not rightly related to the Body, then no matter where you may be, you will not have the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, having the Lord's presence depends on our relationship with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are wrong with the Body, we will not sense that we have the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are right with the Body, wherever we may go we will have the sense of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to be dependent on the Lord, we must be dependent on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are dependent on the Body, then we will also be dependent on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may wonder why you do not have a deep sense of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You do not have the Lord's presence, because you are isolated from the Body, because you are not properly related to the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Endeavor to be built up and to be right with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are right with the Body and are built up in the Body, you will surely sense the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE LORD HAVING REGARD NOT FOR WHAT WE DO</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>BUT FOR OUR DEPENDENCE ON HIM</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have seen that the self is the independent soul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In doing things, our motive, intention, aim, and goal may all be right, but if we are independent, we are in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This may be our situation even in preaching the gospel, for we may preach the gospel in the self and by the self.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may also do certain other works for the Lord, but we may do them in the self and by the self.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am very grateful to the Lord for Matthew 16:21-26.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here Peter was not doing something evil to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the contrary, he was acting out of love for Him and intended to do something good for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, because Peter was independent of the Lord, the Lord turned to Peter and said, "Get behind Me, Satan!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that no matter what we do, even if it is something very good, we are in the self whenever we are independent of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From this we see that the Lord Jesus does not have regard for what we do; rather, He has regard for our dependence on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we see this, we will pay attention not to what we do but to whether or not we are dependent on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to ask ourselves: Am I independent of the Lord or am I dependent on Him?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are independent of the Lord, we are in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are dependent on the Lord, we are spontaneously dependent on the Body.</S>
