<h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF CHANGING DEATH INTO LIFE<br />
BEING TO BUILD UP THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John begins with the Word becoming flesh to be joined and mingled with man for His tabernacling among men (1:14). The Lord is the Lamb of God with the dove in order to take away man&rsquo;s sin so that man may have life, partake of God, and be mingled with God, thus producing the house of God, Bethel (vv. 29, 32, 51). In chapter 2 the Lord did two things related to life and building: He changed water into wine and cleansed the temple. In resurrection the Lord comes to weak and fragile people and changes death into life, and in His resurrection life He builds those who have received His life into the house of God.</p>
<p>In chapters 3 through 11 John presents many cases&mdash;the first case concerns regeneration, and the last case concerns resurrection (3:3-8; 11:43-44)&mdash;to illustrate how the Lord changes death into life. In other words, each case is a matter of &ldquo;changing water into wine.&rdquo; Telling a man to be born again and resurrecting a man out of the tomb, that is, delivering him from the bondage of death, are both related to changing death into life.</p>
<p>Chapters 3 through 11 develop the principle of the changing of water into wine. After chapters 12 and 13, which are a turning point, chapters 14 through 21 focus on the matter of building in resurrection. Chapter 14 begins with the building of the Father&rsquo;s house. In verses 2 and 3 the Lord said, &ldquo;I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.&rdquo; The Lord was in the Father, but the disciples were still apart from the Father. The Lord&rsquo;s going involved His crucifixion, after which He was resurrected, becoming the life-giving Spirit. Since the Lord is now the Spirit, it is possible for us to know that He is in the Father, we are in Him, and He is in us (vv. 16-20). This means that the Lord builds us into the Father. As a result, the Lord and the Father can make an abode with us, and we can abide in the Lord.</p>
<p>We should have this view of the Gospel of John. In this Gospel the Word of God became flesh to be our life, and He is changing death into life in order to build us into God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S BODY BEING THE TEMPLE OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament God&rsquo;s house was the tabernacle and the temple, both of which are shadows; they are not the reality. The physical temple went through three stages. In the first stage the temple was built by Solomon and later destroyed by a Babylonian king (1 Kings 6:37-38; 2 Kings 25:8-9). In the second stage the temple was rebuilt by a remnant of Israelites who returned to Jerusalem under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Ezra after seventy years of captivity (Ezra 3:6-13; 6:13-15). In the third stage the temple was enlarged by Herod, a Gentile king, shortly before the birth of the Lord Jesus. In order to please the Jews, Herod spent forty-six years to enlarge the scale of the temple that had been rebuilt during Ezra&rsquo;s time (John 2:20). The tabernacle and the temple, however, are merely types of the universal building of God, which has not been completed. After relating how the Lord changed water into wine, John speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s cleansing of the temple. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;His disciples remembered that it was written, &lsquo;The zeal of Your house shall devour Me.&rsquo;&rdquo; This word, which is quoted from Psalm 69:9, shows how desperate the Lord was for the completion of the building of God&rsquo;s house. In John 2:18 the Jews said to Him, &ldquo;What sign do You show us, seeing that You do these things?&rdquo; The Lord Jesus answered, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (v. 19). The Jews were baffled by the Lord&rsquo;s word, and said, &ldquo;This temple was built in forty-six years, and You will raise it up in three days?&rdquo; (v. 20). They did not understand that the Lord was speaking of the temple of His body (v. 21). The Lord&rsquo;s body was the temple of God. Although the Jews crucified the Lord and destroyed His physical body, He raised it up in three days; that is, He was resurrected on the third day. This particular word is beyond human consideration. The temple of God was destroyed on the cross, but the Lord built up the temple in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S PHYSICAL BODY BEING DESTROYED<br />
BUT AN ENLARGED MYSTICAL BODY BEING BUILT UP</h2>
<p>The temple that the Jews destroyed on the cross was the physical body of Jesus. The temple that the Lord built in three days in resurrection was not merely His physical body but an enlarged Body. According to John, Peter, and Paul, when the Lord resurrected from the dead, His believers were included in Him, joined to Him, and mingled with Him (John 14:20; 1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6). One person was killed, but millions were resurrected. One grain of wheat fell into the ground, but many grains were brought forth (John 12:24). The Jews destroyed one person on the cross, but on the third day the Lord Jesus resurrected with countless others who belong to Him and are joined to Him. This resurrected Body is an enlarged mysterious Body. Hence, the temple built by the Lord in resurrection is an enlarged mysterious temple. We are in it; every saved person is a part of it.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Lord resurrected, ascended into heaven, and is seated in heaven; that is, His resurrection is complete. On the other hand, the Lord Jesus is still in the process of resurrection. On the one hand, He raised up the temple in three days in His resurrection. On the other hand, the Lord is still leading the church into resurrection. Hence, the &ldquo;three days&rdquo; that began following the Lord&rsquo;s death and culminated with His resurrection will continue until the day of His return. In this time the Lord Jesus will build up the house of God in resurrection.</p>
