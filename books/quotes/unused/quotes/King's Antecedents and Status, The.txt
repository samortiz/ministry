In the first section, the Old Testament, God spoke by the prophets, and in the second section, the New Testament, He spoke in the Son
Augustine once said that the New Testament is contained in the Old, and the Old Testament is expressed in the New
When many Christians come to the New Testament, they skip over the first part of chapter one of Matthew and start reading at verse 18
Although the New Testament is a short book, it begins with four biographies of one Person, four books telling us of the life of Christ
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John present different aspects of Christ because each writer was a different kind of person
Following the Acts, we have all the Epistles, which give a full definition of this wonderful, universal, great Man
The divine concept starts with Matthew and proceeds through John; the human thought starts with John and goes back to Matthew
Matthew tells us that Jesus is the proper descendant of the royal family, that He is the legal heir of the royal throne
With anybody else, no matter who he is or how many biographies people write about him, the genealogy will be exactly the same
In this generation we have the mingling of the divine Being with so many human beings, with all kinds of people
The generation of Christ not only includes the high-ranking people, but also the civilians, the insignificant ones, like Mary and Joseph
The generation of Christ includes all kinds of people: good ones, bad ones, called ones, fallen ones, and recovered ones
According to Jewish custom, a writer of a genealogy would never include a female name; he would include only the names of males
It seems that the divine record here would not mention the good ones, such as Sarah or Rebekah, but the bad ones
The record does not even give her name; it gives only her history in order to remind us of what kind of person she was
If we were to write a biography of Christ and there were no biographies of Him in the Bible, we would not dare to write it this way
We would hide all these impure grandmothers and give the names of the good grandmothers, such as Sarah and Rebekah
The Holy Spirit did not mention Sarah, Rebekah, and all the good ones; however, He purposely included these impure ones
One day the Holy Spirit, typified by Abraham's servant, will bring the spiritual, divine, heavenly Rebekah to her heavenly Isaac
He offered Himself unto death and was resurrected, now He is building God's temple, and in the future He will receive the Bride
The blessing which God promised to Abraham was the Spirit , and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the Triune God
In the first ten and a half chapters of Genesis God tried to work with the created race, but He did not get through
God gave up the created and fallen race, and He called one, Abraham, out of that race to be the father of another race
Out of a place filled with rebellion and idolatry, a place where everyone was one with Satan, God called a man named Abraham
We would not even have a share in the short book of Galatians, because Galatians was written to the descendants of Abraham
Abraham was called out of Babel, the place of rebellion and idolatry, into the good land, which typifies Christ
The called ones, having been called by God out of the fallen race, put no trust in their own effort; they trust in God's work of grace
It is by faith in God's work of grace that God's called people are justified by Him and participate in Christ, their eternal portion
For Abraham to live and walk by faith meant that he had to reject himself to forget himself to set himself aside and to live by Someone else
If we compare Genesis 11:31 and 12:1 with Acts 7:2-3, we see that when God called Abraham in Ur of the Chaldees, he was very weak
We all must be Abrahams, those who forget their past, give up what they are and have, and put their trust in Christ, their good land
If so, then, as heirs of God's promise, as those who inherit the promise of the Spirit, we shall participate in Christ as God's blessing
At a certain time the Lord asked Abraham to offer Isaac, the one God had given according to His promise, for a burnt offering
Last month or last week you may have experienced Christ in a certain way, but today the Lord says, 'Consecrate that experience
To walk in the presence of the Lord by faith means that we do not hold on to anything, not even to the things given by God
Whatever we do on our own in the church life, even in the preaching of the gospel, will only produce an Ishmael
He waited until their natural energy had died out, until they had come to realize it was impossible for them to bring forth a child
He had to learn the lesson of not living by himself, the lesson of giving up his own effort and not doing anything by himself
We all must experience Christ in such a way; not by our doing, striving, or endeavoring, but simply by trusting in Him
Not all the children of Abraham of the flesh are the children of God; only in Isaac will God have His children
Although we are the race of Abraham today, are we walking in the way of Ishmael, or are we living in the way of Isaac?
If we would have Isaac, we must cast out Ishmael, stop our work, and place ourselves into the very working of God
Even before the twins were born, God had told the mother that the younger would be the first, and the elder would be second
Although he was a descendant of Abraham, according to his striving and his nature, he was altogether a descendant of the Devil
Positionally speaking, Jacob was a descendant of Abraham, but dispositionally speaking, he was a child of the Devil
There was a great deal of suffering in the life of Jacob, but this suffering came from his striving, not from God's election
What a mercy that we have been selected to be associated with Christ and to participate in Him as God's eternal blessing!
In order to fulfill God's desire, Levi forgot his parents, his brothers, and his children and only took care of God's desire
Our birthright is also composed of these three elements: the double portion of Christ, the priesthood, and the kingship
When the Lord Jesus returns, the overcoming saints will be with Him to be priests of God and co-kings of Christ
We have seen that Esau lost his birthright because he was profane and that Reuben lost his birthright because of his defilement
Because Judah gained the kingship portion of the birthright, he brought forth the kingly Christ , Christ the Victor
When this genealogy mentions Isaac and Jacob, it does not say 'and his brother'; only when it mentions Judah does it say 'and his brothers'
Judah and his eleven brothers became the fathers of the twelve tribes which formed the nation of Israel as God's chosen people for Christ
From the lives of all these persons, we can discover certain principles which govern our association with Christ
No matter what we are or where we came from, we can be included in the generation of Christ if we fulfill the principles
The fault was not on her side, but on the side of her father-in-law, Judah, who admitted that she was more righteous than he
Although Tamar may be held responsible to a certain extent, she was righteous, and she had a heart for the birthright
In the past, some young people in China were inspired by my preaching, believed in the Lord Jesus, and desired to be baptized
When they learned that their children were planning to be baptized, they gave them no opportunity to leave home
The significance of this for us today is that if we care for Christ and are seeking Him, any way we can truly gain Him is the right way
He put out his hand, and the midwife marked it with a scarlet thread, indicating that he would be the firstborn
Once they have entered the door, they will look back and see written on the inside, Chosen before the foundation of the world'
After we have turned to God and to God's people, we must be joined, built up, and involved with the proper person
If you would have a Salmon and a Boaz you must become involved with the proper believers with the proper leading ones in the leading tribes
We must turn to the Lord, and we must turn to the Lord's people; we must also take care of how we become involved with others
Boaz redeemed his kinsmans inheritance and married the mans widow hence he became a notable forefather of Christ a great associate of Christ
In other words, you should not only take care of your own enjoyment of Christ, but also others' enjoyment of Christ
Some brothers should take care of me, the poor Ruth, but they are selfish in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ
According to Deuteronomy 23:3, the Moabites were forbidden to enter the congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth generation
Not only was she accepted by the Lord, but she became a wonderful person who partook of the enjoyment of Christ
Although, as a Moabitess, Ruth was not allowed to enter the congregation of the Lord, she was seeking God and God's people
You may have been born of a poor origin and have a pitiful background, but do not be bothered or frustrated by that
The eighth day is the first day of the second week; hence, it signifies something new, something of resurrection
We who are chosen and saved are not people of the first week; we are those of the first day of the second week
In this genealogy, only of David does it say 'the king,' because it was through him that the kingdom with the kingship was brought in
If we would have the rich enjoyment of Christ, we shall often need to be the end of one situation and the beginning of another situation
In the church life, we need some Davids, some stronger ones to conclude certain situations and open up other situations
The Bible says that David did right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of his life, except for this one thing
After David committed murder and adultery, he was rebuked by the prophet Nathan, whom God sent purposely to condemn him
Solomon is the result not only of transgression and repentance, but of transgression, repentance, and God's forgiveness
The second was a spiritual marriage, the marriage of David's transgression and repentance with God's forgiveness
The church is always built up by this kind of person, Solomon, the issue of man's transgression and repentance plus God's forgiveness
As we have seen, the building up of God's temple comes from man's transgression and repentance plus God's forgiveness
No matter how hard you may try to do everything right in the eyes of the Lord, sooner or later something will happen
After this repentance, you will have another marriage, the marriage of your transgression and repentance with God's forgiveness
If we spend an hour or two praying over these verses and over the points covered in this message, we shall see something more
We shall be today's Boaz, Ruth, Obed, Jesse, David, and eventually today's Solomon, building up the house of God
The genealogy in Matthew says that the son of David was Solomon, and the genealogy in Luke says that the son of David was Nathan
One genealogy is the line of Mary, the wife's line; the other genealogy is the line of Joseph, the husband's line
Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David, but they were from two families descended from the same grandfather
Under God's sovereignty Mary and Joseph, descendants of these two families, were betrothed and brought forth Christ
His relationship with Christ was indirect through his descendant Joseph's marriage to Mary, of whom Christ was born
Although Christ was not a direct descendant of Solomon, the Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ were nevertheless fulfilled
Christ needed the kingdom that belonged to the house of David because Christ had to be born as the heir of David's throne
If the whole kingdom had been dissolved, nothing would have remained to allow Christ to be born as David's royal heir
As far as you are concerned, which title has the better meaning the kingdom of Israel or the kingdom of Judah?
After a certain time, the church was divided, not into two parts, but perhaps into more than two thousand parts
For this reason, none of the kings of the northern kingdom, the larger and more universal kingdom, is included in the genealogy of Christ
Compare this record with 1 Chronicles 3:11 and 12, which say, 'Joram his son, Ahaziah his son, Joash his son, Amaziah his son, Azariah'
Ahab was the king of the northern kingdom, and his wife Jezebel was a wicked woman who was fully related to idols
Exodus 20:5 says that anyone who forsakes God and worships idols corrupts himself and will suffer God's curse for three or four generations
Those who were carried away to Babylon as captives were indirectly related to Christ through their descendant Joseph's marriage with Mary
Jeconiah was not reckoned as a king in this genealogy because he was born during the captivity and was carried away as a captive
According to the prophecy of Jeremiah 22:28-30, none of Jeconiah's descendants would inherit the throne of David
Ezra 5:1 and 2 say that Zerubbabel was one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from the captivity at Babylon
Suppose none of the people of Israel had returned to Judah, and the time came for Christ to be born at Bethlehem
You may worship God and you may walk in the spirit in Babylon, but be assured that Christ could never be born into humanity through you
When the time came for the Lord Jesus to be born, some Israelites, descendants of the returned captives, were waiting in Judah
For His second coming, Christ also needs some of His captured people to return from their captivity to the proper church life
Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of a woman and born of a virgin
Now we need to examine the chart which shows that the generation of Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus
After David, it is divided into two lines, the first running from Nathan to Mary and the second from Solomon to Joseph
Eventually, in God's sovereignty, these two lines are brought together by the marriage of Mary to Joseph to bring forth Christ
Although the birth of Jesus fulfilled many prophecies in the Old Testament, He was not the descendant of Jeconiah
Luke mentions the name Jesus because Luke proves that the Lord came to be a man, not to be the Anointed One, the King, the Messiah
He was the one person used by God as a landmark both to conclude the section of the fathers and to begin the section of the kings
At the time of degradation, there was no person as a landmark to divide the generations as did Abraham and David
In Revelation 4:6 we have the four living creatures, and in Revelation 7:1 we have 'the four corners of the earth' and 'the four winds'
Jesus is the Triune God traveling through all the generations and coming forth as the mingling of divinity with humanity
Numbers 33:5-48 shows us that the children of Israel traveled through forty-two stations before they came into Canaan
According to the record of the Old Testament, the Israelites suffered all the way through these forty-two stations
These forty-two months will be the concluding part of the final seven years, the last week mentioned in Daniel 9:24-27
There are seventy weeks: the first seven weeks, then sixty-two weeks, and then the last week, each week representing seven years
The second half of these last seven years, a period of forty-two months, will be the great tribulation, and it will be awful
After all the generations of trials, temptations, and sufferings, Christ came as the forty-second generation to be our rest and satisfaction
If we read the history in Chronicles, we shall discover that the generations from Abraham to Christ were actually forty-five generations
We need to see that the record of Matthew is not a record according to history, but a record according to doctrine
The record of John, on the contrary, is according to history, for John wrote his Gospel according to the events of history
According to history, it was forty-five generations, but according to Matthew's doctrinal purpose, it was forty-two generations
Three generations were omitted because they were not qualified, and a fourth generation was disqualified and cut off
When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him
By His sovereignty, God brought Joseph and Mary together in marriage to bring forth Christ to be the legal heir to the throne of David
Zerubbabel, a leader of the tribe of Judah and a descendant of the royal family, led the captives from Babylon to Jerusalem
If they had lived far away from each other, it would have been difficult for them to come together in marriage
Our surrender means little; it simply affords the opportunity for the Holy Spirit's power to come into us and accomplish something
Christ came not only to fulfill the law, but also to fulfill the promise that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent
When man fell, the poison of Satan was injected into his body, and the body was corrupted and became the flesh
The other verse is John 3:14: 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
The Lord told him that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must He Himself be lifted up on the cross
As was the case with the brass serpent in the wilderness, there was no poison in Him because He was not born of a fallen man
Now we must clearly differentiate two points: Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and He was born of a virgin
Through the virgin Mary as a means, He put on flesh and blood, the human nature, taking 'the likeness of the flesh,' 'the likeness of men'
You have heard that Jesus is God and that He took the form of a man, but not that He also took the form of a serpent
When you call on Jesus, the whole universe realizes that you are calling on Jehovah as your Savior, Jehovah as your salvation
In Matthew 18:20 Jesus said that whenever two or three are gathered together in His name, He will be with them
If you have some unseemly pictures or photos on your walls and you call on Jesus, He will be your King and say, 'Get rid of that'!
When no one else can control you neither your parents, your husband, your wife, or your children the King of kings will do something
The Christ in Matthew is the Savior-King and the King-Savior who sets up the kingdom of the heavens within us and over us
We have spent considerable time on the names of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and even on the names of Tamar and Rahab
Although the last part of Matthew 1 seems to deal with the birth of Christ, it actually deals with the names of Jesus and Emmanuel
He saves us from the evil power of Satan, from all our besetting sins in our daily life, and from every bondage and addiction
Whether you hate Jesus or love Him, whether you are for Him or against Him, you realize that the name of Jesus is a special name
We should not only say that we believe in the Lord Jesus, but also declare that we believe in the name of Jesus
Romans 6:3 says that many of us have been baptized into Christ Jesus, and Galatians 3:27 says, 'Many of you have been baptized into Christ'
When we believe in the name of Jesus and are put into the name of Jesus, we are placed into a living Person, that is, in the Holy Spirit
Help them to open up their being, their heart and their spirit, from deep within and to use their mouths to call upon the name of Jesus
If you help new believers to call on the name of Jesus in this way, the door will be open wide for the Spirit to enter in
After the Lord Jesus told us to pray in His name, He proceeded to say that the Spirit will come to dwell in us
Although we may meet for the purpose of having the life-study, we do not gather into the life-study, but into the name of Jesus
Whenever you come to a Christian meeting, you must realize that you are being gathered once again into the name
We can all testify that after every meeting we have had the sense deep within that we have entered further into the Lord
Preaching in the Lord's name must be done in the Spirit, for the Spirit is the Person of the Lord and the reality of His name
Through all the things that can be done in the name of Jesus, we see that whatever we do and whatever we are must be in the name of Jesus
His name is a sweet name, a rich name, a powerful name, a saving name, a healing name, a comforting name, and an available name
One night, as we were preaching on a street corner, a man about thirty years of age was very bold to scoff at the name of Jesus
When the man asked the brother who it was who hated Jesus, the brother answered, 'It is the Devil within you who hates Jesus'
We should also feel glorious whenever we speak to others about Jesus, but often we do not have a glorious feeling
The Pharisees warned Peter and John not to preach in the name of Jesus, not to do anything or say anything in His name
Jesus is the way and the truth, but when we experience Him as the way and the truth we say, 'This way and this truth are just God with me'
When we call on the name of Jesus, we receive the Spirit, who is the Person, the reality, and the realization of Jesus
We have all been under the influence of tradition, thinking that we must fast and pray before we can receive the Spirit
The enemy Satan with all his army will do everything he can to take over this land of Emmanuel that is to take over our spirit and our being
Luke also records that Jesus grew physically, that He became strong in His spirit, and that He found favor with God and man
Matthew 1 tells us that the Old Testament contained prophecies concerning Christ and that the people of God were waiting for His coming
Because the wise men were misled, they caused a serious problem and nearly caused the young child Jesus to be killed
If it had not been for the sovereignty of God, the young Jesus would have been killed as a result of their mistake
Many times you have the vision, but when you consider the matter in your mind, you are distracted and misled by your natural concept
If you had been a priest among those priests, would you not have gone with the wise men to see if Jesus had actually been born in Bethlehem?
They had knowledge and they could tell people that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem; yet, none of them went for themselves
The Bible does say that Christ will be born in Bethlehem, but it does not say where, on what street, or in which house
The living star led the wise men to the city of Bethlehem and also to the exact street and the house where the child was
Because He was burdened to see what people were doing in His Father's house, the temple, He stayed in Jerusalem after the feast
The wise men found the kingly child Jesus in Bethlehem, which Micah 5:2 tells us is 'little among the thousands of Judah'
Due to the vision that came through the star, the wise men paid their full respect to the kingly child, not caring about the place
It may be that these precious treasures offered by the magi provided for the Lord's trip from Judea to Egypt and from Egypt to Nazareth
Those who turn others to righteousness, who turn them from the wrong way to the right way, will shine like stars
Without the trouble that occurred after Jesus was found in Bethlehem, there would have been no occasion for Him to flee to Egypt
The mistake of the magi aroused the hatred and jealousy of King Herod, who was angered that a kingly child had been born
It means that when Jesus was born into the human race, He appeared in a way that was somewhat hidden, in a way that was not open or evident
Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth
We should never make a display of ourselves; neither should we ever know others according to the outward appearance
