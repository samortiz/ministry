   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In such a oneness it is not possible to have division, not even dissension.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this oneness there is no room even for our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we need much more experience of the divine "painting" which brings us into oneness, we have had at least some experience of this in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To a certain degree at least, we have all entered into the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we were in the denominations or independent groups, we found it easy to be opinionated or critical.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in the church the dissenting element and divisive factors are subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the effect of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more the "paint" of the processed Triune God is applied to our being, the more difficult it is for us to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through the application of the heavenly "paint," we are brought into the genuine oneness, not the superficial oneness that is according to the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are in the oneness which is the processed Triune God "painted" into our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have pointed out, this ointment, this divine "paint" does not run down; it spreads.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I want my house to be painted with paint that will stick, not with paint that will run down the walls like water.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, when the ointment is applied to us, it sticks to our inner being; it does not run down.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The running of the ointment is like the experiences in Pentecostalism or in the charismatic movement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Experiences of that kind pass quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the church life, however, the spiritual blessing comes to us gradually, slowly, and gently.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But once it comes, it remains.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once the "paint" is applied to us, it stays.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we have been coated with the anointing oil, the coat remains forever.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nothing can eradicate it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The anointing does not cause us to have very much feeling in our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those experiences that come and go quickly, on the contrary, stir up our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But this is not the normal experience in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the church life we experience the gradual spreading of the all-inclusive ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, in the church prayer meeting we may receive one or two "coats" of "paint" without having much feeling of it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we have pointed out, this ointment has many ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How grateful we are to the Lord for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Day by day in the church life, all the ingredients of the divine ointment are being wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through the application of these ingredients to our inward being, we are spontaneously in the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We find it exceedingly difficult to be divisive or even dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How good, lovely, and enjoyable is the oneness in the church!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The only way to be divisive is for us to make a strong decision contrary to our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are one spontaneously because we have been "painted" with all the elements of the heavenly "paint."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>APPLIED TO OUR BEING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ground of oneness is simply the processed Triune God applied to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the oneness in which we find ourselves today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are not in a oneness produced by adding together those who believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In that kind of oneness it is just as easy to have subtraction as it is to have addition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, once we have been brought into the oneness produced by the application of the processed Triune God to our being, it is very difficult to have any subtraction.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This oneness is altogether different from the oneness in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The oneness in Christianity involves addition and subtraction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the oneness in the churches in the Lord's recovery involves the application of the Triune God to our inward being.</S>
