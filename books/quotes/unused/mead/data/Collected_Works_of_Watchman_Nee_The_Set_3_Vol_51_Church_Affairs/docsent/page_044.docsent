   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SISTERS' MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The sisters' meeting is also a meeting to help the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is the need for this meeting in some places, but perhaps there is not the need in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At any rate, the sisters' meeting is arranged in the following way:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Giving Opportunity for the Ones</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Who Have Received Burdens to Exercise Their Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If one or two sisters who have received burdens from the Lord come to a certain place, we should arrange a sisters' meeting for them so that they may have the opportunity to exercise their gifts among the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If there are sisters in the churches in various localities whom the Lord uses and burdens, we will set up a sisters' meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there are no such sisters, then we do not need to set up a sisters' meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since that need is due to certain sisters being used by God, we need to make arrangements for them so that they may have the opportunity to supply the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Otherwise, there is not this kind of need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Teaching Illiterate Sisters How to Read</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are other sisters' meetings, especially in the countryside, whose nature is different.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some sisters are illiterate and are not able to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Teach them to read.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This also counts as an aspect of the work, an aspect in helping and caring for those who have already believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, among the new believing brothers and sisters, find out who are illiterate and teach them to read.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps in every locality we should make arrangements to teach those who are illiterate to read so that they can read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not let go of this matter by any means.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, this is not an official meeting of the church; rather, this is a work done when the church is serving and preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is also a part of the Levitical service for the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is especially for the brothers and sisters to learn to read and to be able to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE CHILDREN'S MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The children's meeting is also needed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is also a meeting of the local church in the aspect of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have children's meetings in various localities.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This requires that a few brothers and sisters specifically come forth to do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sisters are perhaps more appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not know what materials they are now using in various localities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In some places they use the Bible to teach the children to read and to memorize.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The songs that they sing are composed from Bible verses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They also use pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As to pictures, take heed that this does not lead to deviations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Using pictures of the Lord Jesus is especially inappropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Pictures of flowers and birds do not present any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps there are brothers and sisters among us who are especially experienced with and burdened for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They should come forth and give us some materials that the children in various localities may receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps there are already some brothers who are preparing songs for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the children's meeting is carried out properly, it will also provide a good opportunity for more people to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This meeting indeed needs to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the future I hope that there will be a few brothers and sisters who will come forth to prepare some materials for the brothers to take care of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the number of saved ones in various localities increases, spontaneously the children's meeting becomes very crucial, because they are our next generation.</S>
