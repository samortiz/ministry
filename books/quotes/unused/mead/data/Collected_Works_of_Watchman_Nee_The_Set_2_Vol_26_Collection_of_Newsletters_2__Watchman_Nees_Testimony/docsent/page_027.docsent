   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEWS FROM KAO TZE, KIANGSU PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>who walk together with us:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I received both the seventh issue of Collection of Newsletters and The Glad Tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I read them several times and saw that an unworthy person like me can partake of God's grace only because I have been chosen by the Lord Jesus and sent by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My heart and spirit are very joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I first came here, there was no place to meet, and I did not know any who were believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every day I only saw the evil environment, worse even than that of my home town; I often hated it here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As I was hating it, the Lord suddenly revealed something to me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once in Ta Tung Chuang, Huai An, Brother Ma Yun Ho told me to look to the Lord in everything to see how He overcomes the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Should we not also walk in His way so that He can be glorified?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After that, I bowed down, confessed my sin, and accepted His arrangement, waiting for His will to come.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In May someone told me that Feng Ching Yi, a schoolteacher who lives in Pao Hsiang Yao, used to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the next Lord's Day, I went happily to testify for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when I met with him and spoke of the matter of believing in the Lord and being saved, he spoke with quite a bit of confidence and composure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was nothing for me to say.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I went back discouraged after seeing his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The school began its wheat vacation at the end of June.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I lent him a copy of The Christian Life and Warfare to read to receive the Lord's word with his spirit and in honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now he says to me, "When you first testified for the Lord to me, I did not really refuse it, but there were several questions in my heart which had not been resolved, so I did not want to accept it loosely."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I asked him to tell me the questions so that I could answer him with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Feng saw the proof in the Bible and was suddenly enlightened; the questions in his heart were resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He felt that his presence in the Presbyterian Church or the Baptist Church was part of the divisions and sects mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He immediately decided to serve the Lord zealously, walk in the Lord's way with us, and glorify the Lord daily.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I recently gave him a copy of Collection of Newsletters and The Glad Tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wrote me in response.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After reading his letter, I am sure that he has truly obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We really thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His grace is truly great.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He could not bear Brother Feng's remaining in darkness, so He had to call him out again into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brother Feng and I now pray together morning and evening to ask the Lord to establish a meeting place in the region of Chin Chia Pien and Pao Hsiang Yao.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We ask the Lord to lead His children to come join with us to break bread in remembrance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We also ask Him to increase our life so that we may participate in the kingdom of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Feng's eldest daughter is married and lives in Chin Chia Pien.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One day I heard her husband say that she believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The next day I took some books and studied the Bible with her for about two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It seems that she will be able to obey the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She also feels that the doctrine she heard in the Methodist Church was not very solid.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Recently I have seen that the Lord did not just bring me to this place to teach school.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He wants to shine His light through me, a useless shell, and lead His children back into His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May the brothers and sisters who walk with us in the way of the cross pray much for us so that Satan will not frustrate God's work and so that the glory will completely be to the Father God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May the brothers and sisters in the Lord be full of the power of the Holy Spirit to give overcoming testimonies for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ke Hsueh Meng</S>
