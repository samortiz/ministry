<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>John 20:22 ...He breathed into <em>them</em> and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exo. 30:25 And you shall make it a holy anointing oil, a fragrant ointment compounded according to the work of a compounder; it shall be a holy anointing oil.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit&mdash;His Symbols</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the reality of all the divine entities and matters....Because the Spirit is mysterious and beyond our understanding, the New Testament uses many different symbols, figures of speech, to describe Him. In this [portion] we shall...consider [three of] the symbols of the Spirit.<sup>99</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Breath</h2>
<p>On the night of resurrection, the Lord came into the midst of the disciples and breathed into them a breath, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 20:22). The Holy Spirit here is actually the resurrected Christ Himself, because the Spirit is simply His breath.<sup>100</sup> By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord Jesus imparted Himself into them as life and everything.</p>
<p>The Greek word for Spirit in this verse is <em>pneuma,</em> a word that is used for breath, spirit, and wind. Therefore, this verse can be rightly translated, &ldquo;Receive the holy breath.&rdquo; On the day of His resurrection Christ breathed Himself into His disciples as the holy breath....The divine breath in John 20:22 is the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaching His redeemed people.<sup>101</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Living Water</h2>
<p>The living water is a symbol of the Spirit (Exo. 17:6; John 4:10, 14; 7:38-39). Exodus 17:6 speaks of the living water coming out of the cleft rock. First Corinthians 10:4 tells us that the cleft rock was a rock that followed the children of Israel [and the rock was Christ]. The living water that flowed out of the cleft rock typifies the Spirit as our all-inclusive drink. In John 4 the Lord Jesus told the Samaritan woman that He had the living water to give her. Then in John 7 He said that rivers of living water would flow out of the innermost being of His believers.... Rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of life of the one unique river of water of life (Rev. 22:1).<sup>102</sup> One river is the river of peace, and other rivers are joy, comfort, righteousness, life, holiness, love, patience, and humility. These rivers of living water flow out from the depths of our being. This is the Spirit as living water.<sup>103</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Compound Ointment</h2>
<p>In the Scriptures the Spirit of God is first typified by oil [Isa. 61:1; Heb. 1:9]. This oil is one element, one entity, without any compounding, mingling, or blending. But in Exodus 30 [vv. 23-25] the oil is compounded with four kinds of spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.<sup>104</sup> In typology...flowing myrrh signifies Christ&rsquo;s death, and cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of His death. Calamus, a reed that grows in a marsh or muddy place, shooting upward toward the sky, signifies resurrection. Cassia signifies the repelling power and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Cassia is a kind of bark that was used as a repellent to repel snakes and insects. Thus, cassia signifies the power, especially the repelling power, of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. His resurrection has the power to repel Satan, the serpent.<sup>105</sup> These four spices, precious and fragrant, were blended, mingled, compounded, with the oil. As a result, the oil becomes a compound ointment.<sup>106</sup> This compound ointment is a picture of today&rsquo;s compound Spirit.<sup>107</sup> Before Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God did not have these four elements. But after Christ&rsquo;s resurrection these elements were compounded into the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God became the Spirit, the compound Spirit symbolized by the compound ointment (see <em>Life-study of Exodus,</em> Messages 157-163).<sup>108</sup></p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Topics for New Believers, Vol. 2 &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
