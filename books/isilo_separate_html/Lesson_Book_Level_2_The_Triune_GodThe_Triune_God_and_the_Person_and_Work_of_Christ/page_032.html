Christ Becoming Flesh Yet Without Sin</H2><P>Although the Lord became flesh, He was without sin. Christ was made in "the likeness of the flesh of sin" (Rom. 8:3), but He did not participate in the sin of the flesh. All of Adam's descendants have inherited Adam's sinful nature (Rom. 5:12,19); everyone is born in sin in Adam. This is why the Lord's virgin birth is very important. Although the Lord had the likeness of Adam, He did not inherit the sinful nature of Adam. He was not born in Adam. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit in the virgin Mary. As we shall see in a later lesson, it was necessary for Christ to know no sin (2 Cor. 5:21) and to be without sin (Heb. 4:15) in order for Him to accomplish redemption.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. CHRIST BEING THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</H2><P>The incarnation of Jesus means more than the birth of a Savior. For four thousand years after Adam was created, God was God, and man was man. Yes, man had something to do with God, and God sometimes made contact with man, yet the two remained separate. However, when Christ was born as a man, a strange and wonderful event took place&#151;God was brought into man and thereby formed a mingling of divinity with humanity. Jesus was God and He was man; He was a God-man.</P><P>Because He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, Jesus has the divine essence; and because He was conceived in a human virgin, Jesus has the human essence. Therefore, He is a Person with two essences&#151;the divine and human&#151;mingled together. It is unbelievable to our natural mind that the Almighty God would one day mingle Himself with man. But remember what God's eternal purpose is&#151;God wants to get into man so that man would fully express God. This is just mingling. If Adam had eaten of the tree of life, he would have been a God-man, a man fully one with God. He would have been not just a good man but a God-man. Although Adam failed, Christ, through His incarnation, became the very first man to be mingled with God. Praise the Lord! The Lord Jesus was the Triune God embodied in a man. All the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him bodily (Col. 2:9).</P><P>"In the beginning was the Word..and the Word was God...and the Word became flesh" (John 1:1, 14). Never in the history of the universe had such a thing taken place. You should be very impressed with the great significance of the incarnation. It was so great that it caused an army of excited angels to burst forth from the heavens and praise God (Luke 2:8-14). Four thousand years after man's fall, God became Jesus (Jehovah our Savior) and Emmanuel (God with us). Hallelujah! God with us! Christ's incarnation inspired Charles Wesley to write a wonderful hymn. The first two stanzas are below.</P><ol class="decimal"><li>Hark! the herald angels sing,<br>"Glory to the newborn King;<br>Peace on earth, and mercy mild;<br>God and sinners reconciled."<br>Joyful, all ye nations, rise,<br>Join the triumph of the skies;<br>With angelic hosts proclaim,<br>"Christ is born in Bethlehem."<br><br>(Repeat the last two lines)<br><br></li><li>Christ, by highest heav'n adored,<br>Christ, the everlasting Lord:<br>Late in time behold Him come,<br>Offspring of a virgin's womb.<br>Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,<br>Hail th' incarnate Deity!<br>Pleased as man with man to dwell,<br>Jesus our Immanuel.<br><br>(Repeat the last two lines)<br><br>(Hymns, # 84)</li></ol><P>God is no longer just God&#151;He is God in man.
