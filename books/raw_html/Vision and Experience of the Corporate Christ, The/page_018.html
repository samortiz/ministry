 <h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING TODAY BEING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Some may admit that the consummate word in the Bible concerns God&rsquo;s building, but they may point out that the New Jerusalem is in the future and argue that in order to be practical, we need to focus on something that exists today. However, God&rsquo;s building is not something that exists only in the future; it is here today.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Building in Peter&rsquo;s Experience and Writings</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Peter Being a Stone for God&rsquo;s Building and<br />
Christ Being the Rock for God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>When the Lord first called Peter, the Lord immediately gave him a new name. In John 1:42 the Lord said, &ldquo;You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).&rdquo; The name Peter means &ldquo;a stone.&rdquo; Two or three years later the Lord took the disciples to the border of the Holy Land and asked them, &ldquo;Who do you say that I am?&rdquo; (Matt. 16:15). Peter took the lead to say, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (v. 16). Jesus appreciated his answer and said, &ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). The Lord said, &ldquo;I also say to you,&rdquo; to indicate that He would reveal something further. He seemed to be saying, &ldquo;To know Me as the Christ and the Son of God is not sufficient. You need to know something more&mdash;the church. To know Me as the Christ is only a partial revelation. The complete revelation includes both Christ and the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord said that He would build His church not upon a doctrine or a teaching but upon &ldquo;this rock.&rdquo; To build the church, we do not need a teaching; we need a rock. When the Lord called Peter, He first revealed that Peter was a stone. Later, the Lord revealed that He Himself was the rock upon which the church would be built and that Peter was a stone for the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ and the Church<br />
Being the Head and the Body</h2>
<p>The great mystery is Christ and the church, the Head and the Body (Eph. 5:32). We cannot separate the Head from the Body. Regarding this, the Lord seemed to be telling Peter, &ldquo;You are blessed to know that Jesus is the Son of God, the very Christ appointed and anointed by God to fulfill His purpose, but I also say to you that I will build My church.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Gates of Hades Not Prevailing<br />
against the Builded Church</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, &ldquo;I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&rdquo; The gates of Hades cannot prevail against the builded church. It is easy for Satan to prevail against something that is not built up. If a stronghold is built up, the enemy&rsquo;s goal will surely be to attack it. The church needs to be a builded stronghold.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ Being the Cornerstone <br />
or God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16 Peter received a complete vision of Christ and the church. We know this to be true because he later preached the gospel in an astonishing way, declaring, &ldquo;Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified and whom God has raised from the dead,...this is the stone which was considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner&rdquo; (Acts 4:10-11). Peter preached that Christ is not only the Savior but also the cornerstone to connect the two walls of God&rsquo;s building. Christ as the cornerstone was disowned by the Jews yet honored and treasured by God because God&rsquo;s desire is not only to save us but also to regenerate and transform us into precious stones to build up the church.</p>
