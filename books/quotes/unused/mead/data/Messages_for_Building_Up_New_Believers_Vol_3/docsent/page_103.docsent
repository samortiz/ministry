   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our Being the Temple of the Living God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second Corinthians 6:14-16 says, Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And what concord does Christ have with Belial?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For we are the temple of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You need to know who you are.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You are the temple of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, you cannot have anything to do with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 16 continues, Even as God said, I will dwell among them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You are the temple of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God wants to dwell with you and walk in your midst.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is your God and you are His people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Coming out from the Midst of the Unbelievers</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is the result of this?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s commandment is, Therefore come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you v. 17 . Here we see that we must come out of any Christian group which receives both believers and unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If there is a mixture of believers and unbelievers in a group, even though it may have the name of the church of Christ, we must still come out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>E. Being Right in Principle</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In principle it is right to stop unbelievers from coming into our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once a brother asked me, Have you ever received any person by mistake?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My feeling at that time was that we had not received any wrong person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I answered, Perhaps we have, but the number is quite small.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He said, How then are you different from us?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I said, If any unbeliever has come into our midst, he came in by climbing over the wall at night.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if there is an unbeliever in your midst, you let him in through an open door at twelve o clock noon.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must never be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can often be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can baptize the wrong person and receive the wrong person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, they will have sneaked in by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not wrong in our principle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In so-called Christianity today, as long as a person bears the name of a Christian, he can walk in openly at high noon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It does not mean that we never make any mistakes in procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must be very careful before God not to make any mistakes, but being wrong intentionally or being wrong in principle is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In such a case, we are no longer the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>F. Not Needing to Keep Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>with Non-christians</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a group knows that a certain person is an unbeliever yet capriciously admits him, this group surely is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not necessary for God s children to maintain oneness with this group.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since this oneness is not Christian oneness, we need not keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are required only to keep the oneness of the wheat; we do not have to keep the oneness between wheat and tares.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today there are many groups on earth which call themselves the church but include both believers and unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They want to maintain an outward fa ade of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please bear in mind that we are not required to keep this kind of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This kind of oneness instead will overturn genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The oneness they want to keep is a oneness we want to escape from.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once we get into that kind of oneness, we spoil the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE BOUNDARY OF ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>NOT BEING SMALLER THAN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is another very important matter in the boundary of Christian oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is true that Christian oneness includes all of God s children; it is as large as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christian fellowship is as broad as the Body of Christ, and the church of Christ is as large as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is clearly revealed in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As pointed out in the previous section, there is a danger of enlarging the Body of Christ to include false ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, another problem arises when God s children maintain a oneness which is smaller than Christian oneness.</S>
