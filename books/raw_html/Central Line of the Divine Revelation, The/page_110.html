<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. By Eating the Spiritual Food<br>and Drinking the Spiritual Drink</H2><P>We enjoy the all-inclusive Christ also by eating the spiritual food and drinking the spiritual drink (1 Cor. 10:3-4). The spiritual food is typified by the manna (Exo. 16:4, 14-15, 35), and the spiritual drink is typified by the water that flowed out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6; Num. 20:10-11). Today we have Christ as our manna, and we have the Holy Spirit out of the crucified Christ as our drink. To eat and drink in this way is to enjoy the all-inclusive Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. By Drinking the Spirit</H2><P>Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ is by drinking the Spirit. First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit." This verse says that we are one Body because we all were baptized in the one Spirit. The Spirit was first the means through which we were baptized into the one Body. Now that we have been baptized into the Body through the one Spirit, we should continually drink the same Spirit. We have been given by Christ to drink the one Spirit, in whom we have all been baptized. The Spirit in whom we have been baptized and whom we are now drinking has two aspects, the outward and the inward. The Spirit in the outward aspect is the economical Spirit, and the Spirit in the inward aspect is the essential Spirit. We are baptized in the economical Spirit, and we drink the essential Spirit. Thus, baptism is economical, and drinking is essential.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. By Partaking of Christ as the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>We enjoy the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God also by partaking of Christ as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ has become the life-giving Spirit. We must partake of Him as the life-giving Spirit every day.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. By the Anointing, Sealing,<br>and Pledging of the Spirit</H2><P>We enjoy the all-inclusive Christ also by the anointing, sealing, and pledging of the Spirit (2 Cor. 1:21-22). Anointing is horizontal, but sealing is vertical. The anointing of the Spirit permeates us horizontally, and the sealing of the Spirit saturates us vertically by reaching deeply into our being. The pledging of the Spirit is the first taste, a sample, of the Spirit. The anointing, sealing, and pledging reveal three aspects of the one Spirit today. The Spirit is on us as the anointing Spirit; He is within us as the sealing Spirit; and He is with us as the pledging Spirit. The anointing Spirit is permeating us, the sealing Spirit is saturating us, and the pledging Spirit is the guarantee, the first taste, the sample, given to us for our enjoyment. This anointing, sealing, and pledging is the way for us to enjoy the all-inclusive Christ.</P>
