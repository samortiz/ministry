   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO POSITIONS, NO TITLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Anything without the presence of Christ is just a religion to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The spiritual experiences of yesterday applied to today's situation is just a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we come to the Book of Revelation, suddenly everything is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are even no more positions, no more titles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the local churches of the Epistles, there are firstly the elders or bishops, and then the deacons and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are the titles apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when we come to the Book of Revelation, all these are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul wrote to the churches as "an apostle of Christ Jesus" Eph 1:1 , but John in the Revelation speaks of himself as "your brother" 1: 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By the time John wrote the Book of Revelation, he was close to one hundred years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was really qualified and experienced as an apostle; he did have the position.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the time he wrote Revelation, he was the last of the original twelve apostles left on the earth, but he never referred to himself as such in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"I John, your brother," he said.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That is all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was the position, that was the qualification he assumed in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because in the Lord's economy in this book and in this age all these things position, title, qualification are over.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today, in the age of the spirit, there is no position, no title, and no qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is only one thing the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are no elders; there are only stars.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may presume to be a proper elder, but you can never presume to be a star.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you are a star, you must shine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a shame today to claim the position of being an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a shame today to claim any position because of your many years of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It matters not how long you have been in the work of the Lord, but it matters very much whether you are shining or not.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Are you shining?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Are you living?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are you burning?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord today in the age of the Spirit does not care for anything your experiences, your position, or your qualifications but for the seven burning Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Have you been burned by the seven Spirits?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And are you burning in the sevenfold Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today is not the day of the Epistles; today is the day of the Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today is not the day of the elders; today is the day of the shining stars.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oh, the deadness, oh, the deadness of claiming the position of an elder!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That is a religion, and it will eventually become a part of the great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The position which you claim will never be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who claim positions are as dead as doornails.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no flow among them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is nothing living, nothing burning, nothing shining.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To claim a position, to claim a certain title, is nothing but a kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That is not life, that is not Christ that is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After reading so much concerning Christ versus religion, you may still not know what religion is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may be criticizing other brothers, criticizing the responsible ones, criticizing the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This too is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"Oh, the Lord be merciful to us!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How much we need Your rescue, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need Your deliverance!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Deliver us from the positions, deliver us from the titles, deliver us from the qualifications, and deliver us from the criticisms."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All of these things belong to Babylon the Great; they will never be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Babylon there are the pope, the cardinals, the bishops, etc. many positions, many titles.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But in the churches there are no positions, no titles, no qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is just the sevenfold Spirit with the shining stars.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You may claim that you are in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But is that really the lampstand in your city?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Is it shining?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Oh, the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not ask, "Are we not the house of God?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Are we not the local church?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What about the shining?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Where is the lampstand?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Is there anything shining in the darkness of your city, in the night of this age?</S>
