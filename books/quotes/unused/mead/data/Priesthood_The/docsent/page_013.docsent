   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPHETHOOD BUILDING INDIRECTLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The prophethood is not as basic a ministry as the priesthood and kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Hebrews tells us that Christ is a Priest, and the book of Matthew tells us that Christ is a King.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But not one book tells us that Christ is a Prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, in some verses He is called a prophet, but not one entire book emphasizes His prophethood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is because the prophethood is not as basic for God s purpose as are the priesthood and kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is true of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Peter tells us that the spiritual house, which is the building of God, depends on the priesthood 1 Pet 2:5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This priesthood is not only the holy priesthood, but also the kingly or royal priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Zechariah and Haggai we see the three ministries of the priesthood, kingship, and prophethood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Zechariah was a priest, but he spoke as a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Haggai was a prophet, but he helped the priesthood and the kingship in the building of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The governor and the high priest were the ones to take care of the building of God s temple, but they were a little weak and even discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the prophet was called to help.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the prophet did not build the temple; the governor and the high priest did.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God only sends the prophet to strengthen the priesthood and kingship that they might build up the house of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Can the church today be built up by the prophet?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No, it can only be built up by the brothers and sisters who exercise the priesthood and kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The position of the prophet is to help, but not to build.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We think that we need a preacher, a minister of the Word, or a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all pay too much attention to the prophethood and neglect the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the priesthood and the kingship are both our birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A prophet would be unnecessary if we would enjoy and exercise our birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The problem is that doctrinally we understand that we have been born priests and kings, but we simply do not know how to exercise this birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The only way to exercise the priesthood and kingship is to learn the lesson of the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be mingled with the Lord by opening ourselves again and again to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then He will saturate us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE FELLOWSHIP AND THE AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The throne of God is the center of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the kingship, the authority, the headship, and the lordship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then from the throne issues the flow of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The throne is the kingship with the authority; the flow is the priesthood with the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we open ourselves to the Lord, He is able to flood us with Himself that He may flow out to others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we are in the fellowship of the priesthood, and the flow of this fellowship brings the authority of the throne with it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The whole New Jerusalem is under the throne and the flow of the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that the whole building of God is under the priesthood with the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Most Christians give their attention to ministers, preachers, and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that they give their attention to the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But not many prophets will take care of the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Most of them simply give some messages about redemption and then establish standards of moral behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, it is impossible for the Lord to have His building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why the Lord is recovering the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His recovery is nothing other than the recovery of His building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must learn that today our major need is not to have the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What we need most is to assume our position as priests and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is our birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have been born in the house of God as priests and kings; now we must be bold enough by His grace to take up this position.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But merely to declare this does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must also open ourselves to the Lord for Him to possess us and saturate us with Himself that He may flow out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we will have the flow of the priesthood, in which there is the authority of the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is in this way that we come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We simply behave as priests and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not come to teach others, but we open ourselves to the Lord that His flow might flow through us to others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We simply open our spirit to express something to the Lord by praying or praising.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once the Lord has a channel through us, the flow out of us into others will be so prevailing that the whole meeting will be a flow of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There will not be teaching with the exercise of the mind, but only the flow through the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In today s so-called church service, the minister speaks by exercising his mind, and the listeners exercise their minds to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hardly anyone exercises his spirit; therefore, there is no flow.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It becomes a teaching with a religion not the flow with life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Consequently, there is no nourishment or building up.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For this reason, we must not pay too much attention to the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you would all take the position of the priesthood and kingship, even I would simply be a priest and king among you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is only when the priesthood is so weak and the kingship has disappeared that the ministry of the prophet is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I long to see the time when there is not much teaching or instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only the flow of life through every member will build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The building of the tabernacle was without any prophets, but was very much with the priesthood and the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Moses represented the authority of kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At the same time, Aaron was the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This was also true in the building of the temple, for there was the priest as well as King Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>And the one who prepared the way and the materials for the building of the temple was David, who was in both the kingship and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Also, in the recovery of the temple, there was the governor of Judah with the authority of kingship, and there was Joshua, the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Not one prophet built the temple directly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The prophet only functioned indirectly, helping the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Likewise, in the two books of the recovery, Ezra and Nehemiah, Ezra was a priest, and Nehemiah was a governor with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>One was in the priesthood, and the other was in the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is not one book for the prophethood as such, but there are many books for the prophets to help the kingship and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Strictly speaking, the prophetic ministry is unnecessary for the building up of the church if the basic need of the priesthood and the kingship is fully taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all must open ourselves to the Lord and let Him flow in to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then we will have the authority and be in order.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There will be the flow of life with the headship in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In today s situation in Christianity there is no fellowship, but there is much confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The normal church life has the fellowship of the priesthood with the order of the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Everyone is under the authority of the Head when they are all in the flow of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>For example, look at our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The arm is under the shoulder, the hand is under the arm, and the fingers are all under the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>All the members must be under the head in order to be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There is then no confusion, but everything is in order with the fellowship of the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I do long to see a group of believers who realize the real meaning of the priesthood and the kingship and do not look to a preacher or teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If the Lord sends someone to help them, they are grateful, but they are not dependent on him, for they all exercise and enjoy their position as priests and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In both the Old and New Testaments, this two-fold ministry is necessary in the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>First Peter 2:5 and 9 tell us that the building of the spiritual house is the priesthood and that this priesthood is holy and kingly.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>These priests are kings.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They know the fellowship and the authority, meaning that they know the life and the Lord s headship.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We must have the life flowing within and be under the headship of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The church is not a matter of democracy or autocracy; it is a matter of kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When I am going to speak to a brother, I must speak under the headship of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I do not have the freedom to say anything apart from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is not the control of man, but the control of the Head over the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we are under this headship, we will also be in authority.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It is needless for you to exercise authority over others; they will sense the authority in you by your being under the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Suppose a brother is very careless about the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He says whatever he chooses to say and criticizes the brothers freely.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Eventually, he will become lighter than air.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He will have no weight.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The more he criticizes, the less authority he has.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But, on the contrary, if a brother is under the headship of the Lord, his mouth, his thinking, his mind, his heart, and his work are all under the control of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The more he lives in this way, the more others will sense the weight and the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This is true kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The authority in the church is not by organization or by voting, but is that which comes by being under the Lord s headship.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We all, as the children of God, must realize that we are born priests and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Therefore, by His grace we must assume this position by exercising our spirit to take the priesthood in reality and to be under the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Then the fellowship in life with the headship of the Lord will build up the church.</S>
