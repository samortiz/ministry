<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE NEED TO SEE THE VISION</H2><P>[We all need to see the vision of the dispensing of the life of the Triune God into the three parts of our being. If we see this divine vision, our natural concept of ethics and morality will be shattered. We need to say to the Lord, "Lord, I thank You. Since You came into me, my spirit has become life. Now if I set my mind on my spirit, my mind also will be life. O Lord, how I praise You! Through Your indwelling Spirit, Your zoe (Greek, God's divine life) life can be dispensed even into my mortal body. Lord, I worship You for this, I enjoy this, and I am one with You in this dispensation." This is the dispensation of the life of the Triune God into the tripartite man. Through such a dispensing the Triune God becomes one with the tripartite man, and the tripartite man becomes one with the Triune God. It is through this dispensation of the divine life that we become sons of God. Furthermore, it is by this dispensation that we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ. This is the Christian life and the church life.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>Romans eight reveals the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man. The Triune God as the Spirit enters into man's spirit making it life. As the mind is set on the spirit, the mind becomes life and eventually life is given even to our mortal bodies. Thus, the Triune God as the Spirit fully saturates the tripartite man, making God and man fully one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Questions </H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Explain how we can see the Triune God in Romans eight.</li><li>Of how many parts is man composed?
