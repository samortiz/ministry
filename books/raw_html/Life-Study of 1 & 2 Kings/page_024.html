<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>k. Its Inner Court</H2><P>The inner court of the temple (6:36) signifies the separation through God's sanctification from the common world (in which were the bronze altar and the bronze sea).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Built with Three Courses of Hewn Stones</H2><P>The inner court was built with three courses of hewn stones, signifying the crucified Christ in His resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) Built with One Course of Cedar Beams</H2><P>The inner court was built also with one course of cedar beams, signifying the resurrected Christ in His humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) Becoming the Separating Wall</H2><P>The inner court built with hewn stones and cedar beams became the separating wall as a line separating the dwelling of God from the common world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Bronze Sea with Ten Bronze Lavers</H2><P>The bronze sea with ten bronze lavers signifies the convicting, judging, and renewing Spirit of God washing away, based on the death of Christ, all the negative things from those participating in the dwelling of God on earth (7:23-40; John 16:8; Titus 3:5). Solomon also built an altar of bronze (1 Kings 9:25), but it is not listed here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Golden Table for the Bread of the Presence</H2><P>The golden table for the bread of the presence signifies the Christ who has gone through the processes of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and has become the life-giving Spirit to be the spiritual food of God's elect (7:48b; John 6:32-63).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Golden Lampstands</H2><P>The golden lampstands signify the Christ who has become the life-giving Spirit through His resurrection to be the divine light to His people (1 Kings 7:49; John 8:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Golden Altar with Its Incense</H2><P>The golden altar with its incense signifies the resurrected and ascended Christ to be the sweet savor for God's acceptance of His redeemed (1 Kings 7:48a; Rev. 8:3).</P><P>There is no mentioning in the list in 1 Kings 6 and 7 of the building of the ark of the covenant because Solomon still kept the ark of the covenant made by Moses (6:19; 8:3-9).</P>
