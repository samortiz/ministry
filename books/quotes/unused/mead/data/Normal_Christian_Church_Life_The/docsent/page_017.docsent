   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE ELDERS APPOINTED BY THE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Elders" is a designation of Old Testament origin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We find reference made in the Old Testament to the elders of Israel and also to the elders of different cities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Gospels we meet the term again, but still in relation to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even the elders referred to in the first part of Acts are of the Old Testament order 4:5, 8, 23; 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When were elders first instituted in the Church?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 11:30 refers to them in connection with the church in Jerusalem, and this is the first mention of elders in connection with any church; but though their existence is mentioned, nothing is said of their origin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not till Acts 14:23, when we read of Paul and Barnabas returning from their first missionary journey, do we discover who they were, how they were appointed, and by whom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"When they had appointed elders for them in every church and had prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE APPOINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen that the apostles themselves could not remain with the new believers to shepherd them and to bear the responsibility of the work locally.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How then were the new converts cared for, and how was the work carried on?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The apostles did not request that men be sent from Antioch to shepherd the flocks, nor did one of them remain behind to bear the burden of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What they did was simply this: "When they had appointed elders for them in every church and had prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord into whom they had believed" v. 23 . Wherever a church had been founded on their outward journey, they appointed elders on their return journey.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They did not wait until any arbitrary standard was reached before appointing elders in a church, but "in every church" they chose a few of the more mature members to care for their fellow believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The apostolic procedure was quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The apostles visited a place, founded a church, left that church for a while, then returned to establish it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the interval certain developments would naturally take place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the apostles left, some of the professing believers would leave too.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Others would continue to attend the meetings, and would prove themselves to be truly the Lord's, but would make no appreciable progress.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Others again would eagerly press on in the knowledge of the Lord and show real concern for His interests.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who had more spiritual life than others would spontaneously come to the front and take responsibility for their weaker brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was because they had proved themselves to be elders that the apostles appointed them to hold office as elders, and it was their business to shepherd and instruct the other believers, and to superintend and control the church affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nowhere did the apostles settle down and assume responsibility for the local church, but in every church they founded they chose from among the local believers faithful ones upon whom such responsibility could be placed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they had chosen elders in each church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord, just as, with prayer and fasting, they themselves had been committed to the Lord by the prophets and teachers when they were sent out on their apostolic ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If this committal of elders to the Lord is to be of spiritual value, and no mere official ceremony, a vital knowledge of the Lord will be required on the part of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is easy to become so occupied with the problems and needs of the situation, that one instinctively takes the burden upon oneself, even while admitting the truth that the Lord is responsible for His own Church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to know Christ as Head of His Church in no mere intellectual way if we are to let all its management pass out of our hands at the very outset.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only an utter distrust of themselves, and a living trust in God, could enable the early apostles to commit the affairs of every local church into the hands of local men who had but recently come to know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All who are engaged in apostolic work, and are seeking to follow the example of the first apostles in leaving the churches to the management of local elders, must be spiritually equipped for the task; for if things pass out of human hands and are not committed in faith to divine hands, the result will be disaster.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Oh, how we need a living faith and a living knowledge of the living God!</S>
