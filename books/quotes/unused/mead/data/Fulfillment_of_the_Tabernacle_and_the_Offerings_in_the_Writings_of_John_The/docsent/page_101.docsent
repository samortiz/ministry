   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Blind Man Cast Out of the Fold</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The blind man in chapter nine was among the chosen ones in the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He may not have been willing to go out of the fold, but the Pharisees, the thieves and robbers, cast him out.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may say that they ushered him out of the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But although the Pharisees cast him out of the fold, he actually came out through Jesus Christ as the door.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Enjoying Christ as the Pasture in the Daylight</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Throughout the centuries of the New Testament age, many "folds" have been established.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, every denomination and nearly every Christian group has become a fold.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the fold there is a shortage of light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some of God's chosen people are still in the darkness, even though the New Testament age is in the daytime, not in the nighttime.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Have you ever heard that for us who are enjoying Christ as the pasture this is the daytime?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As one who is in the church life in the Lord's recovery, I do not have the sense that I am in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, I did not have this feeling when I was in a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But after I was brought by the Lord into the enjoyment of Christ, my night was turned to day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Has this not been your experience as well?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of us can testify that in the church life we are in a spiritual day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praise the Lord that we are in bright daylight!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Inwardly we are filled with light, and outwardly we are surrounded with light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, in our daily experience sometimes we are still in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we are strong in the spirit, we are in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when we are in the flesh, we are in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our spiritual experience the spirit is a day to us, and the flesh is night.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a hymn which speaks of Jesus as the wonderful Shepherd who brought us out of the fold into the pasture that is so good to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brought us right out of the fold</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Into His pasture so plenteous,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Into His riches untold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Glorious church life,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Feasting from such a rich store!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here where we're dwelling in oneness</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God commands life evermore.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the divisions He sought us,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Weary and famished for food;</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Into the good land He brought us,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oh, to our spirit how good!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jesus Himself is our pasture,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the food that we eat;</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We as His sheep are fed richly</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Each time, whenever we meet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hymns, #1221</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A flock is in the pasture during the daytime.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a similar way, if in our Christian experience we are in the pasture, we shall also be in the daylight.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The brightest time for us is when we are in the spirit enjoying the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But our darkest time is when we are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we are in the flesh, we are full of lust, self, and the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What darkness that is!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Praise the Lord that when we are in the spirit we are full of light!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Jesus Christ the Lord is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to John 1:4, this life is the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, when we have life, we have light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moreover, when we have light, we are in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We thank the Lord that sovereignly He has brought us out of the folds into the pasture and out of night into day.</S>
