   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO CULTURAL DISTINCTIONS IN THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to 3:11, in the new man there is no possibility for the various cultural distinctions to continue to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here there is no longer the distinction between the cultured and the uncultured, for in the new man Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After speaking of this, Paul goes on to charge us, who come from many different backgrounds, to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This peace is the issue, the result, of the death of Christ that terminated the cultural differences.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, whenever the peace of Christ presides in us, this peace will subdue cultural opinions, religious observances, and philosophical concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>GENUINE PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Often when we pray, we do not enter into genuine prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through experience we can differentiate or discern prayer that is genuine from prayer that is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you know why it is so difficult to pray in a genuine way?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The main hindrance is not sin or worldliness; it is cultural opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Unconsciously and subconsciously, we are still controlled by our cultural opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if we persevere in prayer, we shall eventually pray in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that in our prayer we are released from cultural opinions and enter into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever we experience genuine prayer, we are outside of our culture; in particular, we are outside of our cultural opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During times of genuine prayer, we are in our spirit, and we are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is at these times that we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, at such times of genuine prayer the death of Christ works within us in a prevailing way to terminate all the negative things in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Spontaneously, Christ s resurrection power also prevails in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, we are actually one with Christ and identified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This experience during times of genuine prayer gives us a taste of the normal Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more genuine prayer we have, the more we shall have the experience of being outside our cultural opinions, of being one spirit with the Lord, and of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sad thing is that when we stop praying, we automatically revert to our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we strive to live according to our own asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we enter into genuine prayer, we are far away from asceticism and all other isms, for we are one with the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, when we pray in this way with others, we are truly one in the praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we touch the reality of the one new man, where there is no Greek or Jew, barbarian or Scythian, circumcision or uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We realize that the new man is constituted of Christ alone and that in this realm there are no differences of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, when we stop praying, we come back to our natural life with its opinions and striving.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead of living Christ by being one spirit with Him, we restrict ourselves according to our self-imposed asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In our natural life we make up our minds to do good, and we endeavor to accomplish what we have determined to do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the suppression of the self; it is not the living out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To pray perseveringly means that we should never depart from the praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should remain in a praying condition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be in this condition is to be out of our opinion and to be one spirit with the Lord, living Him and taking Him as our life and as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Spontaneously we are away from everything other than Christ, and we are living by this living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our problem is that we do not remain in such a condition of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was the reason Paul charges us to persevere in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must pray perseveringly in order to be preserved in such a praying condition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, our daily living should be the same as our experience in times of genuine prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our experience in prayer should become a model of our daily Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In these days we are burdened to look to the Lord that we may see the true significance of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We thank Him that gradually He is showing us what it means to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One aspect of living Christ is that of remaining in a praying condition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we are in this condition, we are outside of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because we are one spirit with this living Person, taking Him as our life and as our person, there is no striving to live properly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, as we are one with the Lord in spirit, the death of Christ is applied to us, and His resurrection power becomes prevailing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we spontaneously live Him.</S>
