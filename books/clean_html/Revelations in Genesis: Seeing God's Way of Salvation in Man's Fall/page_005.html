<h2 class="head2">The Body Acting</h2>
<p>The third step in the process of man&rsquo;s first fall was the body acting. Once Eve&rsquo;s soul was exercised, her body responded with action. The soul directs the body. When Eve saw that the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a delight to the eyes and desirable, she decided to take it and eat. Taking and eating the fruit were actions of her body. First, there was a seeing with her eyes. Second, there was a taking with her hands. Third, there was an eating with her mouth. Fourth, there was a giving to her husband. After Eve took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and ate, &ldquo;she also gave some to her husband with her, and he ate&rdquo; (v. 6). This may be likened to a wife who plays mah-jongg and brings her husband into playing it as well, or a wife who goes dancing and brings her husband into dancing. Romans 1:32 speaks of such ones, &ldquo;who, though fully knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also have fellow delight in those who practice them.&rdquo; All sinners not only commit sins themselves but also want others to do the same. If our colleagues like to play mah-jongg, sooner or later they will want us to play mah-jongg. They like it best when we wallow in the same mire. </p>
<p>I came across this kind of temptation when I was young. Some of my friends asked me to play mah-jongg. I did not understand the game at that time, but they said, &ldquo;It does not matter. It is all right if you do not understand.&rdquo; Then I asked, &ldquo;What if I lose money?&rdquo; and they said, &ldquo;The money you lose is on us; the money you win is yours.&rdquo; Thus, I followed along. It was truly the work of the devil.</p>
<p>I am told that opium smokers also use all kinds of methods to bring others into smoking opium. Sinners all like to bring others along into their sinning. After Eve took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and ate, she gave some to her husband, and her husband ate. Man&rsquo;s first act of sin was then complete.</p>
<p>There are only three steps involved in committing sin. The first step is not using our spirit, that is, going beyond God. Man has three parts: the innermost is the spirit, then there is the soul, and the outermost is the body. We should use our spirit first, let our spirit direct our soul, and then let our soul direct our body. Then we would not sin easily. If, however, we use our soul instead of our spirit, we assume the headship, and our soul is the decision maker. This is the second step. Once the soul becomes the decision maker, it directs the body to do things that offend God. This is the third step. This is the process every time we sin against God. Every offense in God&rsquo;s eyes occurs according to these three steps.</p>
<p>Many Christians do not like to pray about matters in their life. A saint once said to me that he would like to do a certain thing, and he asked, &ldquo;Brother Lee, do you think I could do it?&rdquo; I responded, &ldquo;Have you brought this matter to God first in prayer to see what is His will?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Honestly, I dare not pray. I know that once I pray, God will not want me to do this.&rdquo; Christians have many stories like this, and they are unwilling to pray about many matters. For example, a brother may be unwilling to pray about proceeding with the matter of marriage, because he knows that as soon as he prays, God will not want him to proceed. He, therefore, decides not to pray. Not praying means that he is suppressing his spirit, setting God aside, going beyond God, and assuming the headship. When only his soul, including his mind, emotion, and will, is exercised, he determines the course of his marriage and, as a result, offends God. Without exception, these three steps are involved in all our offenses toward God. This is an ironclad principle.</p>
<p>Whenever we encounter a matter, we should ask God reverently from deep within about His feeling, that is, whether there is permission or forbiddance, peace or uneasiness, or joy or sorrow. If the inward sense is one of permission, peace, and joy, then we may do it according to His will. If the inward sense is one of forbiddance without peace or joy, then we should be subdued and, according to His will, not do it. When we are subdued in our spirit, we are subdued before God, preserved from the schemes of Satan, and preserved from falling.</p>
