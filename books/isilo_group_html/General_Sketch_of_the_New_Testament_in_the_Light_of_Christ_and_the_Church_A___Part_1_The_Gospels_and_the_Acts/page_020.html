Before proceeding, however, there is a need to make several points clear.<p>First of all, the Gospel of John is constructed in a certain historical sequence, especially with respect to eternity. The other three Gospels-Matthew, Mark, and Luke-are not arranged in this way. John&#8217;s Gospel has the best historical arrangement, for it starts from the beginning in eternity past and it continues indefinitely into the future. Even after the last chapter, the record of this Gospel is not finished, for the history recorded in it has no end.<p>Second, John&#8217;s record reveals to us how God comes into man and brings man into Himself. Hence, in this book there is the coming and going of the wonderful Christ. As we have seen, by His coming He brought God into man to live as a man on this earth, and by His going He brought man into God, causing man to be one with God and enabling man to live in God. This is the content of this Gospel. The Gospel of John is a record of these two main items-the coming and going of this wonderful One.<p>Third, the Gospel of John is divided into two main sections. The first section is composed mostly of the first twelve chapters and shows how Christ came through incarnation to bring God into man. This is His coming. The second part, chapters fourteen through twenty-one, unveils how Christ went through death and resurrection to bring man into God. This is His going. Chapter thirteen is a turning point that divides the book into two parts. In order to understand the second section, we must know the first section. If we are going to understand His going, we must know His coming.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST COMING THROUGH INCARNATION TO BRING GOD INTO MAN</h2><p>John 1 starts from the very beginning, that is, from eternity past. This wonderful One in eternity past was the Word, God Himself (v. 1). At a certain point He created the heavens and the earth, and following creation He came in incarnation to be a man in time and lived on this earth (vv. 3, 14). Then the Lord unveiled the kingdom with its requirements, He exposed the real condition of the fallen race, and He manifested His all-sufficiency. From chapter three through chapter eleven, there are nine cases in which on the one hand, man&#8217;s condition is thoroughly exposed, and on the other hand, Christ&#8217;s all-sufficiency is fully applied to meet the need of every man&#8217;s case.<p>The first case is one of regeneration in life, related to Nicodemus (2:23-3:36). In the second case the Lord talked with a Samaritan woman (4:1-42). The first case deals with a good man, whereas the second case concerns an immoral woman. The third case is related to the need of the dying (vv. 43-54), and following this is the record of an impotent man who had been sick for thirty-eight years (ch. 5). Although the sick man knew what to do, he lacked the strength to do it, being weak to the uttermost.<p>The next case is related to a hungry crowd around the sea (ch. 6). The sea signifies a situation in which there is no peace and no satisfaction, in which people are hungry and troubled all the time. The Lord Jesus is the only one who can satisfy our hunger and calm the storm. Therefore, we must eat Him and receive Him into our boat. Following this, John 7 gives us a picture of thirsty people. To be thirsty is more serious than to be hungry. The Lord Jesus is the only one who can afford us the living word to quench our thirst.<p>The seventh case tells us of a guilty, dirty, and sinful woman, who was caught in adultery (7:53-8:59). Here, Christ is the One who is able to forgive, deliver, and release people from the bondage of sin. The eighth case concerns a man who was born blind (ch. 9). Although we are born in darkness, Christ is the one who is the light of life. The last case involves Lazarus who died and was buried (ch. 11). In this situation, the Lord is the resurrection life. The final need of man in the first section of John&#8217;s Gospel is resurrection. We are not only sinful and blind but dead. Therefore, we need the resurrection life. If we look into these nine cases, we can realize that they give us a full picture of man&#8217;s condition and need and of how Christ is the all-sufficient One who meets the need of man&#8217;s every case.<p>Then after the case of resurrection, we come to chapter twelve. Because Christ manifested Himself as such a wonderful One, many people came to Him and warmly welcomed Him. However, He told them that He, as the one grain of wheat, had to die in order to be multiplied as the many grains (v. 24). All the foregoing events were His coming to bring God into man to meet all of man&#8217;s needs. Now at the end of His coming He declared that He needed to go by death and resurrection for the purpose of multiplication. This is the first main section of the Gospel of John.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 1: The Gospels and the Acts &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
