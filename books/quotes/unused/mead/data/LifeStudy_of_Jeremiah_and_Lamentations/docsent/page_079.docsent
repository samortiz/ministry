   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Jeremiah's Praise to Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Jehovah's Acknowledgement of His Praise</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 19 through 21 speak of Jeremiah's praise to Jehovah and of Jehovah's acknowledgement of his praise.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In his praise Jeremiah said, "O Jehovah, my strength and my stronghold, / My refuge in the day of distress; / To You the nations come / From the ends of the earth and say, / Surely our fathers inherited falsehood / And vanity, in which there is no profit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>/ Shall a man make gods for himself, / Though they are no gods?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As Jeremiah praised Jehovah, he spoke to Him in a very human way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In His acknowledgement of Jeremiah's praise, Jehovah said, "Therefore behold, I am causing them to know; / At this time I will cause them to know / My hand and My might, / And they will know that My name is Jehovah" v. 21 . Jehovah's speaking here was also quite human.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The conversation recorded in these verses is much like a conversation between two human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>C. Judah's Sin and Its Consequence</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 17:1-4 we have a word about Judah's sin and its consequence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Judah's sin is written with an iron pen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With the point of a diamond, it is engraved on the tablet of their heart and on the horns of their altars.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God will give their wealth and treasures as spoil, and they themselves will let go of their inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jehovah will cause them to serve their enemies in a land which they do not know, for they have kindled a fire in His anger which will burn forever.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>D. The Curse of Trusting in Man</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>and the Blessing of Trusting in Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jeremiah 17:5-8 is a word about the curse of trusting in man and the blessing of trusting in Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning the blessing of trusting in Jehovah, verses 7 and 8 say, "Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah / And whose trust Jehovah is./And he will be like a tree planted by water, / Which sends out its roots by a stream, / And will not be afraid when heat comes; / For its leaves remain flourishing, / And it will not be anxious in the year of drought / And will not cease to bear fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These verses can be understood in two different ways according to the natural understanding and according to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the natural understanding, these verses seem to indicate only that if we trust in God, we will be blessed, mainly in a material way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the revelation here includes much more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to God's economy, the one who trusts in God is like a tree planted by water, signifying God as the fountain of living waters 2:13a .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The tree grows beside the river by absorbing all the riches of the water into it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a picture of God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to receive the divine dispensing, we as the trees must absorb God as the water.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The thought here is the same as that in 1 Corinthians 3:6, where Paul says, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The watering is for the tree's absorbing, and the absorbing is the receiving of God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The tree grows with God as the Supplier and the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The supply is the riches of the supplying God dispensed into us as the plants so that we may grow into God's measure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, the plants and God, God and the plants, are one, having the same element, essence, constitution, and appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jeremiah 17:7 and 8 are not concerned merely with such a shallow matter as trusting in God to receive material blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually these verses refer to God's economy carried out by His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is the living water to be dispensed into our being in order to become our very constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all need to see the crucial significance of absorbing God as the living water that we may be constituted with His element and essence.</S>
