   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Incarnated Christ Being</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's Tabernacle and God's Temple</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Old Testament, both God's residence in the heavens and His retreat place on Mount Zion in Jerusalem were physical.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in the New Testament, God's residence is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Testament, Christ is the tabernacle of God and the temple of God John 1:14; 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Church as the Enlargement of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being God's Enlarged Temple His Dwelling Place</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ has been enlarged, and the enlarged Christ is the church as God's enlarged temple.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church as the enlargement of Christ is God's enlarged temple, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Corinthians 3:16 Paul said that the believers corporately are the temple of God; in Ephesians 2:22 he said that we are being built together into a spiritual dwelling place of God; and in 1 Timothy 3:15 he said that the church is the house of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we call on the name of Christ, we get God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, God is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church, of course, is not a physical building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We believers are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we are meeting together, we are the church in practicality, and God is dwelling in and among us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Often when I am in a meeting, I do not want to be dismissed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am happy and feel so pleasant when I am with the saints in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are at home and not in the meetings, we may not feel that pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no comparison between how we feel at home and how we feel in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some of the saints have to drive a long distance to get to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why do they do this?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are not crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They do this because they want to enjoy God in the house of God, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is in Christ and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes we have problems and become puzzled, not knowing what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may pray in our desire to know God's will, but it seems that our prayer is to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we may come to the church meeting, and in the meeting we receive the light, and everything becomes clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is because God is in the church.</S>
