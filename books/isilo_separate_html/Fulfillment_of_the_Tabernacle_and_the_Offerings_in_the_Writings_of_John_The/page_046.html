However, how many pay adequate attention to the word &#8220;bride&#8221; in verse 29? In this verse John the Baptist said, &#8220;He who has the bride is the bridegroom.&#8221; When I was a young Christian, I heard messages on Christ as our Bridegroom. I was told that the Lord Jesus would come back as our Bridegroom. But how poor it would be to have the Bridegroom without the bride! In the Bible we have a universal couple -the Bridegroom and the bride. The bride is the aggregate of regenerated persons, and the Bridegroom is Christ with whom all regenerated persons should be one.<h2 class=head2>Christ&#8217;s Increase</h2><p>John 3:30 speaks of Christ&#8217;s increase. This increase is the multiplication and reproduction of Christ. It is important for us to know that the regenerated part of our being is the reproduction, the multiplication, of Christ. This increase of Christ is His bride.<p>Speaking in a general way, we may say that those who believe in Christ and who have been regenerated are the increase of Christ. However, we need to study this matter thoroughly and ask what it is that makes us a part of Christ&#8217;s increase. Our natural life and living are not part of the increase of Christ. For example, if you speak in a natural, joking manner, you are not living as part of Christ&#8217;s increase. On the contrary, that way of speaking is part of the serpentine being, and the serpentine being cannot be part of Christ&#8217;s bride, His increase. Only the regenerated part of our being, our regenerated spirit, is Christ&#8217;s increase.<p>John 3:6 says that that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Often we live and speak in a natural way according to the flesh. But there is another part of our being, the regenerated being, the spiritual being. This regenerated part of our being is a part of Christ&#8217;s increase.<h2 class=head2>The Unlimited Christ</h2><p>In 3:31-35 we see the unlimited Christ, the Christ who is all in all. The expression &#8220;the unlimited Christ&#8221; may be new to you. We shall define this in the next message.<h2 class=head2>The Immeasurable Spirit</h2><p>In 3:34 we have the immeasurable Spirit. The immeasurable Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit is immeasurable in sphere and all-inclusive in nature.<p>We have listed eight matters in chapter three of John concerning which Christians have very little realization: the serpentine flesh, the brass serpent, the spirit, the bride, the Bridegroom, Christ&#8217;s increase, the unlimited Christ, and the immeasurable Spirit. Although John 3 is often used by Christians for teaching and preaching, most believers do not give adequate attention to these eight matters. Therefore, we need to pay our attention to them and have an adequate realization concerning them.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> </body></html>
