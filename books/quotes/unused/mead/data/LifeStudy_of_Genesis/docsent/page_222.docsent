   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In previous messages we have seen many of the riches that are found in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall see another item of these riches the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The kingdom is one of the many truths that is sown as a seed in the book of Genesis, developed throughout the Bible, and reaped as a harvest in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have already seen that, after the flood, Noah and his family lived a life in resurrection and that such a life was a shadow of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we shall see that this life in resurrection was also a shadow of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The kingdom is a very great subject in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a most significant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>a. The Beginning of Human Government 1 Man Being Given Authority over Others</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a crucial verse in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All Bible teachers agree that in this verse, a verse which indicates that God has given man authority over other men, we can see here the beginning of human government.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before that time, God had never given man authority over others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All men were directly under God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But, due to the fall, there is a rebellious nature in mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason, God established a certain authority on earth to be His deputy to rule over man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the beginning of the book of Genesis until the time of 9:6, there was no indication that, apart from the husband being the head over his wife 3:16 , God had given man authority over others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, after the flood, when in resurrection man lived on the earth in a new way, God established a deputy authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2 Noah Being the Deputy Authority</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Noah was God's deputy authority after the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the head of a new race, he was the deputy authority under God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Adam was not God's deputy authority over man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was appointed to have authority over the creatures, not over man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you read Genesis 1 carefully, you will see that Adam had authority over the fish, the fowl, the cattle, the creeping things, and "over every living thing that moveth upon the earth" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>26, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But there is not one word to indicate that Adam was given authority over other men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But after Noah became the head of a new race, God gave him authority not only over creatures other than man, but also over man.</S>
