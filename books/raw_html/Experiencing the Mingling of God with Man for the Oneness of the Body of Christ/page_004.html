 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INCREASE OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE ONENESS OF THE INCREASE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:29-30; 12:24-25; 15:5; 17:21-23; 20:17; 1 Cor. 10:16-17; 12:12-13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AS THE INCREASE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We have pointed out that the three main points in the Gospel of John are life, the increase, and the oneness of the increase. The Gospel of John tells us that the Lord Jesus came to give us life and that this life is Himself (10:10b; 14:6). Christ Himself is life to us, so when we receive Christ, we receive life. The purpose of this life is to produce the bride, who is the increase of Christ. In 3:29-30 John the Baptist said, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. This joy of mine therefore is made full. He must increase, but I must decrease.&rdquo; The bridegroom is Christ, and the bride, the increase of Christ, is the church, which comprises all those who believe in Christ.</p>
<p>The picture of Adam and Eve in Genesis indicates that the church is the bride and the increase of Christ. It shows us that Eve was not only Adam&rsquo;s bride but also Adam&rsquo;s increase. God did not create Adam and Eve apart from each other. Rather, God first created Adam and then took a rib from Adam in order to make Eve as a counterpart for him (2:22). Thus, Eve was a part of Adam; she was both the counterpart and the increase of Adam. Without Eve, Adam would have been single like a bachelor, but with Eve, Adam had a wife and a counterpart to match him. Similarly, by Himself Christ is single and needs a bride. This bride is the church, which is also the increase of Christ. The church came out of Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam, and the church is the same as Christ in life and in nature (2 Pet. 1:4), just as Eve was the same as Adam in life and in nature. Thus, the church is the increase of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The One Grain Becoming the Many Grains</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John reveals that the Lord came to impart life to us in order that He could have an increase for Himself. In 12:24-25 the Lord told us that He was the one grain of wheat that would fall into the earth to die in order to become the many grains. Originally, He was the one grain of wheat, but through death and resurrection He became the many grains, which are the believers as the increase of Christ, the multiplication of the one grain. As the many grains we are exactly the same as the original grain, Christ. In our natural life we are the increase and multiplication of Adam, but as those who have been reborn, we have the life of Christ, and because of this divine life, we are the increase and multiplication of Christ. In the natural realm we are of Adam, but in the spiritual realm we are of Christ. We must clearly realize that in the spirit we are Christ&rsquo;s increase.</p>
<p>If we realize what the life and nature of the church are, we will realize the purpose and function of the church. The church as the Body of Christ is nothing but Christ Himself (1 Cor. 12:12). The church is the increase of Christ, and we are members of the church; thus, we are members of Christ (Rom. 12:5). When we were regenerated, we became members of Christ, and now Christ must be the life by which we live.</p>
<p>We must learn to always deny our natural life in order to live by Christ as our life. This must not be a mere doctrine and teaching to us; it must also be our practice and experience. For instance, suppose a brother comes to speak to us. By which life and in which person would we contact him? As Christians we have two lives and two persons. We have two lives; one is the life of Adam, and the other is Christ as our life (Col. 3:4). We have two persons; on the one hand, Adam is our person, and on the other hand, Christ is our person (Phil. 1:21a). Because we have two lives and two persons, we may say that we have two last names; our last name was originally Adam, but now it is Christ. Whenever we are going to talk with someone, we must realize and remember that we are two persons with two lives. We are constantly in a situation in which we must choose to live by one life or the other and in one person or the other. Thus, we must constantly look to the Lord that we may choose to contact people and do everything in the new man and by the new, spiritual life rather than by the old man and by the old, natural life.</p>
<p>Living in Christ and by Christ as our life involves the lesson of the cross. It is a fact that our old man has been crucified on the cross (Rom. 6:6), but when we are contacting people, we must apply the crucifixion of the cross to our old man. We must reckon that our old man has been crucified and put to an end and that now it is Christ who lives in us. In this way we will contact people not by ourselves but by Christ. This is a matter of practice. To know the doctrine that we have been crucified on the cross and that &ldquo;it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20) is not sufficient. The urgent need today is that we practice this. If we love the Lord and are seeking His heart, we will realize that the urgent need today is that we practice what we know about Christ in all the affairs of our daily life. The desire of the Lord&rsquo;s heart and what He is seeking for is that we live Him.</p>
<p>We must practice one thing at all times and in all things&mdash;to reject our natural life and take Christ as our life. If we practice this, we will realize that each of us is one of the many grains, one member among many members. If we live by our natural life, we will not realize this matter, but if we reject ourselves and take Christ as our life in our daily affairs, we will realize that we are each parts of the Body of Christ and that we need to depend on the other members (Rom. 12:4-5). We may believe that each of us is one grain among many grains, but we may not have this sense or realization in our daily living, because we still live by our natural life. When we practice to give up ourselves and to take Christ as our life, we will realize that we are parts of the increase of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Vine and the Branches</h2>
<p>The Lord told us not only that we as the many grains are the increase of Christ but also that He is the vine and we are the branches (John 15:5). As branches of this vine, we are the increase of Christ, and just as the branches are the same as the vine in life and in nature, we Christians are the same as Christ in life and in nature.</p>
<p>What is a Christian, and what is the church? A Christian is a part of the church, and the church is the increase of Christ. Thus, we Christians are parts of the increase of Christ. We are branches of the vine and have the life of the vine. We also have another life, the natural life, which causes us to live as something other than branches of the vine and to not sense the need to depend on other Christians. However, if we deny the natural life, take Christ as our life day by day, and live as branches of the vine, we will sense our need for other Christians (1 Cor. 12:19-22). We will realize that we are only members and that we cannot be the increase of Christ by ourselves. It is the entire Body that is the increase of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Firstborn among Many Brothers</h2>
<p>In John 20 we see that the Lord&rsquo;s brothers are His increase. On the morning of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the Lord appeared to Mary and told her, &ldquo;Go to My brothers&rdquo; (v. 17). In 1:14 the Lord is called the only begotten Son of God, but chapter 20 tells us that the Lord has brothers, indicating that the Lord was multiplied. As the only begotten Son of God, He was the one grain. However, through His death and resurrection, He produced the many grains. He, as the original grain, is the first among the many grains, and all the other grains are out of Him. Thus, the only begotten Son of God became the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29) among the many sons who are His increase. The many grains, the branches of the vine, and the many brothers are all the increase of Christ. Christ has been increased; He is no longer merely the one grain or merely the only begotten Son. He has been increased and is now the Firstborn among many brothers.</p>
