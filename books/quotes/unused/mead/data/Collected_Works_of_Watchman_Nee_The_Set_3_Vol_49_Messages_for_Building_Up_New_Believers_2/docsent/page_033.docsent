   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RESTORING THE BROTHER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not sufficient for us to just forgive our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This only takes care of the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We still need to restore him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the charge in Matthew 18:15-20.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. Telling the Person</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Matthew 18:15 says, "If your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If he hears you, you have gained your brother."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Offenses occur all the time among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a brother offends you, what should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord says, "Go, reprove him between you and him alone."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a brother offends you, the first thing you should do is not to tell others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not tell the brothers and sisters or the elders of the church about it or make it the subject of your conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not the Lord's charge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a brother offends you, the first thing you should do is go to him and tell him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A problem often arises when a brother offends another brother and then the offended brother goes around publicizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He continually talks about it until the whole church knows about it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the brother who supposedly offended him remains unaware of the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such tale-telling is typical of the conduct of a weak person; only a weak one would be so timid as to not talk directly with the offending brother.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He would only dare to speak about the matter behind his back; he would dare not speak about it face-to-face.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is an unclean thing for anyone to speak of matters behind others' backs and to spread gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do have to deal with our brother's fault, but the Lord does not want us to tell others first.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first one who needs to be told is the person who is directly involved, not others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we learn this basic lesson well, the church will be spared many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How do we tell others?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Should we write a letter to them?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord did not tell us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord did not say that we should deal with it in writing, but rather by going to our brother and speaking to him face-to-face.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, just as it is wrong to speak about a matter behind someone's back, it is equally wrong to speak about it in front of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The matter should be communicated "between you and him alone."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many children of God fail in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They publicize things before many people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the Lord charges us to speak only when the involved parties are together.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, individual sins should be dealt with by the individuals alone; no third party should be involved at all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to learn this lesson before God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should never say anything behind the back of the brother who has offended us, and we should not speak to him in front of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must point out his fault only when we are alone together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not have to talk about other things or bring up other problems; we simply need to point out the fault.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This requires grace from God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is one lesson God's children must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some brothers and sisters may think that this is too troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While this is, in fact, quite troublesome, you cannot be afraid of trouble if you want to walk according to God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you feel that your brother's offense against you is too small to be bothered with, you may feel no need to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If this is the case, there is also no need to tell others about it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you feel that a matter is insignificant, simple, trivial, and unworthy of bringing to his attention, you should not tell others about it either.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You should not think that he does not need to be informed but that others do need to be informed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you want to speak of it, speak to him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If there is no need to speak of it, simply keep silent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is wrong for others to know about something when the offending brother is ignorant of it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>B. The Reason for Telling</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The second half of verse 15 says, "If he hears you, you have gained your brother."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the reason for telling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The reason for telling your brother is not to receive any compensation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is only one reason for telling: "If he hears you, you have gained your brother."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the issue is not how much loss you have sustained.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If your brother has offended you, and the matter is not cleared up, he will not be able to get through to God; there will be obstacles in his fellowship and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why you have to admonish him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not a matter of venting your hurt feelings, but a matter of your responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is a very small matter if it is simply a matter of hurt feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If it is just a matter of hurt feelings, if the issue does not pose a problem to you, and if you think you can get over it, you do not need to speak to your brother or anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No one knows better than you do how serious the matter is to you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The responsibility of making the decision to go or not to go rests with you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Such responsibility rests with the party who is clearest about the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There are many things that can be let go of, but there are also many things that must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If some offenses will indeed stumble your brother, you must point out his fault to him while he and you are alone together.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Anything that should be dealt with must be dealt with carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You may let the matter go easily, but the other party may not be able to get through like you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He has committed an offense before God, and God has not yet forgiven him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If a brother has committed a mistake that will jeopardize his relationship with God, this is not a small matter, and you should go and clearly tell him about it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You must find an opportunity while he and you are alone together and say, "Brother, it was not right for you to offend me in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Your offense will ruin your future before God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You will create obstacles and bring loss to yourself before God."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If he listens to you, "You have gained your brother."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In this way you restore your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today many of God's children do not obey the teaching of this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Some people always speak of others' wrongdoings, continually publicizing them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some do not tell others, yet they never forgive and always harbor grudges in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some forgive but do not try to restore.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But this is not what the Lord wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is wrong to speak of others' faults; it is wrong to keep silent yet be unforgiving in the heart; and it is equally wrong to forgive but not to exhort.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord did not say that it is good enough for us to forgive the brother who has offended us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord also showed us that the offended one has the responsibility to restore the offending one.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Since it is not a small thing to offend someone, we have the responsibility to tell the one who has offended us for his sake.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must think of some way to restore our brother and gain him back.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When we speak to him, we must be proper in our attitude and pure in our intention.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our purpose is to restore our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If our intention is to gain him, we will know how to point out his fault.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If our intention is not to restore him, it will only worsen the relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The purpose of exhortation is not to ask for recompense or to justify our own feelings; it is for the purpose of restoring our brother.</S>
