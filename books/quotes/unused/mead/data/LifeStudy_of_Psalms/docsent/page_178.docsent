   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THREE CATEGORIES OF PERSONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REGARDING THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Psa 49 51</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In studying the Psalms, we need to pay attention to the sequence of the psalms and also to how the psalms are arranged in groups.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that Psalm 45 is a psalm concerning the king and that Psalms 46 48 are a group of psalms concerning the city of the king, Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we will consider another group of three psalms Psalms 49 51.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalms 49 51 cover three categories of persons regarding the enjoyment of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first category Psa 49 consists of those who trust in their wealth that is, in anything other than Christ .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the second category Psa 50 are those who call upon the Lord according to His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The third category Psa 51 is a single person, King David, repenting, confessing his sins to God, and asking God for His purging.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those in the first category have no share in the enjoyment of God in Christ; those in the second category participate in the enjoyment of God; and the one in the third category has a full portion of the enjoyment of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to ask ourselves where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Are we in Psalm 49, Psalm 50, or Psalm 51?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we want to have the full enjoyment of God in Christ, we must be like the one in Psalm 51, the one who thoroughly repented and confessed his sins to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I. THOSE TRUSTING IN THEIR WEALTH</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 49 is about those who trust in their wealth anything other than Christ .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the Lord's word, in this age wealth, which is mammon, represents the entire world Matt 6:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some people think that money can do anything; they believe that as long as they have money, they do not need anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead of trusting in God, they trust in money.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are the ones in Psalm 49.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word in Psalm 49 should be a warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To trust in money to trust in anything other than Christ is to be in Psalm 49.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Things such as our education or car may be a kind of wealth, or treasure, to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we trust in such things, we have no share in the enjoyment of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. A Word of Wisdom</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Psalm 49 is a word of wisdom, the meditation of understanding vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 3 the psalmist says, "My mouth will speak wisdom,/And the meditation of my heart will be that of understanding."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Hebrew word translated "meditation" may also be rendered "utterance."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To love money is to be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person who is lacking in money may be very sober, clear, and full of understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, a person who has a great deal of money is likely to be foolish and use his money to do foolish things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, those who are greedy and covetous also are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such persons do not have the wisdom and understanding found in Psalm 49.</S>
