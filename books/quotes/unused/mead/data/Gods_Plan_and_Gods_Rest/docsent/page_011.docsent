   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REDEMPTION AND CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to note the relationship between redemption and creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should by no means consider that the Bible speaks of nothing but redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thank God that in addition to redemption there is also creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The desire of God's heart is expressed in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's goal, God's plan, and God's predetermined will are all made known in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Creation reveals God's eternal purpose; it shows us what God is truly after.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The place of redemption cannot be higher than that of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Redemption recovers what God did not obtain through creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Redemption does not bring anything new to us; it only restores to us what is already ours.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God through redemption achieves His purpose in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To redeem means to restore and recover; to create means to determine and initiate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Redemption is something afterward, so that God's purpose in creation may be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Oh, that the Lord's children would not despise creation, thinking that redemption is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Redemption is related to us; it benefits us by saving us and bringing us eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But creation is related to God and God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our relationship with redemption is for the benefit of man, while our relationship with creation is for the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May God do a new thing on this earth, so that man will not only stress the gospel but go beyond that to take care of God's work, God's affairs, and God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In fact, our preaching of the gospel should be with a view to bringing the earth back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must show Christ's triumph over the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are not Christians, that is something else.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But once we have become Christians, we should not only receive the benefit of redemption but also achieve God's purpose in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without redemption we could never be related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But once we have been saved, we need to offer ourselves to God to attain the goal for which He first made man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we pay attention only to the gospel, that is only half of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God requires the other half, that man may rule for Him upon the earth and not allow Satan to remain here any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This half is also required of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hebrews 2 shows us that redemption is not only for the forgiveness of sins, that man may be saved, but also to restore man back to the purpose of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Redemption is comparable to the valley between two peaks.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As one descends from one peak and proceeds to ascend the other, he encounters redemption at the lowest part of the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To redeem simply means to prevent man from falling any further and to uplift him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, God's will is eternal and straightforward, without any dip, so that the purpose of creation may be achieved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, something happened.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man has fallen, and man has departed from God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The distance between him and God's eternal purpose has become farther and farther apart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's will from eternity to eternity is a straight line, but ever since his fall, man has not been able to attain to it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thank God, there is a remedy called redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When redemption came, man did not need to go down anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After redemption man is changed and begins to ascend.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As man continues to rise the day will come when he will again touch the one straight line.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The day that line is reached is the day the kingdom will come.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We thank God that we have redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Apart from it we would plunge lower and lower; we would be suppressed by Satan more and more until there would be no way to rise.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Praise God, redemption has caused us to return to God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What God did not obtain in creation and what man lost in the fall are completely regained in redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must ask God to open our eyes to see what He has done so that our living and work may have a real turn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If all our work is just to save others, we are still a failure, and we cannot satisfy God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Both redemption and creation are for the obtaining of glory and the overthrowing of all the power of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us proclaim the love of God and the authority of God as we see the sin and the fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But at the same time, we must exercise spiritual authority to overthrow the devil's power.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The commission of the church is twofold: to testify the salvation of Christ and to testify the triumph of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand, the church is to bring benefit to man, and on the other hand, it is to cause Satan to suffer loss.</S>
