AND NOT RELYING ON ORGANIZATION</h2>
<p>To work for the Lord, we should not rely on organization; once there is an arrangement and organization, our work will be similar to a worldly enterprise that first establishes a small unit and then develops into a bigger organization. This is how a general leads an army. First, he trains the soldiers; then he forms them into a corps or division. Although such an arrangement is not altogether useless in the Lord&rsquo;s work, if our work relies entirely on organization, it will become like degraded Christianity. Organization is not a sign of advance but of becoming fallen. If the church is established by organization, it is merely an organization, not the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is an organism. It can be compared to the human body. In the operation of the human body, although there is a certain amount of organization, it is linked to the body organically. For example, although dentures can be inserted into our mouth, they are merely an organization; they may be in the right position and have the proper function, but they do not have an organic relation with the body.</p>
<p>The value of a work or a church depends on how much is left after organization is taken away. In 1975, due to the need, there was a change in the church in Taipei. The church in Taipei had a history of twenty-six years, extending from 1949 to 1975; through these twenty-six years of development, it was inevitable for the church to experience some changes. The longer a church is in existence, the more the church becomes organized and develops a kind of organization; the more the church is an organization, the more fallen it becomes. Therefore, no matter where we work, we must endeavor to avoid organization.</p>
<p>After the change of system in 1975, the number attending our Lord&rsquo;s table meeting decreased by one-third. When there was an organization, over seven thousand met in seventy to eighty homes for the Lord&rsquo;s table. After the change, the organization was removed, and everyone walked and served according to the spirit without relying on organization. In the end, the number of attendees dropped from seven thousand to four thousand; approximately one-third of the people were gone. This proves that in 1975 one-third of those attending the Lord&rsquo;s table were upheld by organization, and two-thirds were upheld by life. Some said that it was sad to lose one-third of the people; nevertheless, I felt that it was quite good that two-thirds remained and that not everyone left once the organization was removed. I believe that if the organization in the denominations ceased, only one-tenth would remain, and the majority would be scattered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE SAINTS TO DEVELOP<br />
THEIR ORGANIC FUNCTION</h2>
<p>Those who work with the students need to lead them to function for the development of their organic function. The development of the students&rsquo; organic function is an important part of our service. In the past we may not have paid much attention to this matter; instead, we relied on organization and arrangement. In fact, part of the work with the students relies on visiting people through door-knocking. Every student needs to knock on the doors of his classmates. This is not an arrangement. Although outwardly speaking it seems to be an arrangement, this arrangement is for every brother and sister to fulfill his or her organic function. In the same way, after we preach the gospel through door-knocking and bring people to salvation, we need to begin to contact the new believers and help them establish home meetings and group meetings. Apparently, it may seem to be an arrangement, but this arrangement is for all the brothers and sisters to fulfill their organic function. In the matter of door-knocking, if there is no arrangement, everything will amount to zero. This kind of arrangement relies on the organic function of the saints and develops their organic function.</p>
<p>The organic function of the saints will not be influenced by a change in the national situation. Even if the national situation changes, the brothers and sisters can spread to the whole inhabited earth, to the cities, villages, roadsides, and parks and fulfill their organic function by preaching the gospel everywhere. If preaching the gospel is merely a matter of arrangement, once the national situation changes and the arrangement is gone, no one will do anything because, like a machine without an arrangement, no one will know what to do. Thus, we always need to remember that the church and the Lord&rsquo;s work are an organism, not a machine. If it is a machine, it would not be able to move when there is no &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; or when a &ldquo;screw&rdquo; is missing. However, this does not apply to organic function. For example, if a person has a kitchen and a dining room in his house, he can cook three meals, sit down, and eat with his family. If, however, the kitchen were demolished and the dining room no longer existed, the family would still think of a way to eat. They could still buy bread or noodles and eat by the roadside and stay well fed. Man&rsquo;s eating is something organic and does not require a certain arrangement. When we lead the church and the Lord&rsquo;s work, we can still find food to satisfy the need of the Body even if the &ldquo;dining room&rdquo; and &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo; are destroyed. Hence, although the environment may change, our organic function of eating continues.</p>
<p>Some may say that because of the change in the outward arrangement, many works have been incorporated into the training center, and thus, the campus work is affected. This proves that our work is a matter of arrangement and is not organic. For example, our literature work puts out books and publications when we have desks and sufficient equipment, and we also put out books and publications when we do not have desks or sufficient equipment. We write when we have pens and pencils, and if we run out of pens and pencils, we continue by writing with brushes. No matter what circumstances we face, we continue to put out our publications because our literature work is organic. This organic operation cannot be defeated or hindered. We should lead the church and the work in a similar way.</p>
<p>My inward, organic feeling toward the literature work and the leading of the church remains the same. Based on my learning, I do not want to have so many arrangements, but I would like to serve and lead by the organic function. I hope that we would all remember this principle. It is not that we cannot use outward arrangements, but we should make use of them only when they are necessary.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 2: Leading the Saints to Practice the New Way Ordained by the Lord &nbsp; pg 60</div><br></body></html>
