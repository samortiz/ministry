While redemption is God's great act, consecration should be our great act. If I asked, "Is redemption a great thing in the universe?", you will surely say yes. Redemption is indeed a crucial thing, but consecration is just as crucial as redemption. In fact, the goal of redemption is achieved through consecration. Redemption recovers God's lost authority in man, while consecration returns God's lost authority and position in man back to God. Hence, we can say that redemption and consecration are two sides of the same thing. No one can be a proper Christian without consecrating himself to the Lord. It is vain to exhort, encourage, or inspire others to consecrate themselves. Unless a man sees the basis of consecration, he cannot consecrate himself. Once a man sees the basis of consecration, it becomes very spontaneous for him to consecrate himself to the Lord. Only those who have seen the basis of consecration will consecrate themselves to the Lord in a thorough way.</p><p>Paul was very clear concerning the basis of consecration. His consecration was an answer to God's compassion. Chapters one through eight of Romans are on redemption. Chapters nine through eleven are parenthetical words; the nation of Israel is presented as an illustration. Following this, chapter twelve speaks of consecration. The basis of consecration is redemption. First there is redemption, and then there is consecration. First Corinthians 6:19-20 says, "Do you not know that...you are not your own? For you have been bought with a price. So then glorify God in your body." Redemption is the reason and the cause for consecration. Second Corinthians 5:14-15 says, "For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised." These verses say that since the Lord has died for us, we should live to Him. When we see His redemption, we offer up our consecration. We must show others what redemption is before we can talk to them about consecration.</p><p>If a man has not seen redemption, his consecration will be temporary and baseless. If a man does not see redemption, he cannot consecrate himself. Even if he has consecrated himself, his consecration will not be thorough. What is redemption? Redemption is the greatest subject in the eyes of God. It recovers God's lost right. In God's eyes this world is not only sinful, but lost. Luke 15 does not say that there were a hundred sheep and that one lost its temper; rather, it says that one was lost and missing. It does not say that a woman had ten silver coins and that one became rusty. It says that one was lost. In the parable of the prodigal son, it says that the prodigal son was lost and was as good as dead. In God's eyes, when man sinned and fell, He lost something.</p><p>Christians are God's inheritance. God created the universe with the intention that Christ would be the Head over all things and that all things would be made subject to Him. But a tragedy happened&mdash;man sinned and fell. The man that God created became lost; he became someone else's possession. This was a tragedy to God. Would you not feel grieved if your hard-earned monthly salary fell into someone else's hand and was lost? The same is true with God. His greatest grief is His loss of man.</p><p>Man's sins are a secondary issue. The main issue is that God lost something. The prodigal son may have made money or squandered money, but he remained a prodigal. Others may have found him to be a good man, even a gentleman, but they would still have to say that he was a lost man. This shows us that the primary goal of redemption does not concern the issue of sin. This is like a watch being pawned to the pawn shop and remaining there for three years. During the three years, the owner of the watch has lost his right to the watch. On man's side redemption means the forgiveness of sins, while on God's side it means God gains something back. Sal- vation is for man to gain something, whereas redemption is for God to gain something. Redemption brings back to God what He had lost in Eden. Redemption also tells us that henceforth we belong to God. Originally, man belonged to God. Later, he belonged to someone else. Now God is redeeming man and recovering him.</p><p>Since redemption means the recovery of man back to God, the matter of consecration immediately follows. Consecration is man's acknowledgement of God's right in him. It is the acknowledgement of God's place in the universe. There are three passages in the Old Testament which provide an understanding of consecration: Exodus 12&mdash;13, Exodus 32, and Numbers 8. Exodus 12&mdash;13 provides the most complete type of redemption. On the night of the Passover, all the firstborn were killed. At that time the Israelites were slaves under the domination of foreigners. They cried out as a result of their suffering, and their cry reached God. God cared for them and promised to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians. He said that the Israelites were His people, while Pharaoh said that they were his people. God wanted the Israelites to serve Him in the wilderness, but Pharaoh wanted to keep them in Egypt to make bricks and build cities for him. The controversy between God and Pharaoh was centered around to whom the Israelites belonged. It was not a matter of whether or not the Israelites were going to heaven; it was a matter of to whom the Israelites belonged.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
