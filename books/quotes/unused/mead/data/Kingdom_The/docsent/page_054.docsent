   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE MYSTERIES OF THE KINGDOM 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 13:24-33; Gal 1:15a, 16a; 2:20; 4:19; Eph 3:17a THE THORNY PLACES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last chapter we began to cover the mysteries of the kingdom from Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We saw that the Lord Jesus is both the Sower and the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As He sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside which was hardened by the traffic of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Other seeds fell on stony ground where stones beneath the surface hindered their growth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we come to the next kind of earth, that which is filled with thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should remember that the source of the thorns was the serpent Gen 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Matthew 13:22 the Lord Jesus told us that the thorns represent the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These thorns choke the growth of the Lord Jesus within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all are familiar with the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the United States it is easy for people to earn a living, but this situation is filled with temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These temptations arise from the cooperation between the modern things and our lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to earn a living in order to maintain our existence on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With this there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, Satan is very subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's intention is for us to earn a living, but Satan's subtle design is to choke the growth of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we know the Lord's way, we will be happy to lower our standard of living rather than trying to lift it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will continually encounter the temptation of raising our standard of living, of wanting better cars and bigger houses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is an endless cycle of slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan wants to make us slaves to the standard of living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He will entice us to work harder and longer to make more money and then to occupy more time to spend the money.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is much wiser to simplify our living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will save us considerable time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no need for us to work so hard and to occupy so much time in spending money.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The care of this age is really a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not be trapped by it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many Christians have fallen into this snare and have been trapped by the anxiety of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, many brothers and sisters have been willing to lower their standard of living for the sake of migration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They have sacrificed their standard of living, and this afforded them a way to migrate to various places.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not an easy matter to migrate from one city to another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are the real Hebrews, pilgrims on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are not settlers or dwellers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Lord allows, we will continue to take many more cities by the way of migration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if we are always trying to raise our standard of living, we are through with migration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as we have food, drink, and clothing, that is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not here for our standard of living; we live on this earth for the Lord's recovery.</S>
