<p>The Lord has prepared Taiwan with its transportation system, and He has prepared the manpower, the funds, and people in general. Hence, we should have accomplished many things for the Lord. However, even after three years the result in the work is not satisfactory because we have limited the Lord. The Lord provided for us, but we have not given Him a way to move. I know that this is our condition, because I have visited all the churches. On the one hand, I am thankful to the Lord because saints are maintaining His testimony in every place by His grace. On the other hand, I feel that we have limited the Lord. The Lord has prepared the environment, the manpower, and the people, but we have limited Him. We need to consider the condition of all the churches and the Lord&rsquo;s desire in the light of His provision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE</h2>
<p>In Matthew 6 the Lord charged the disciples to pray, &ldquo;Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). After the Lord was raised from the dead, He said to the disciples, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (28:18-19). In chapter 6 the Lord prayed for God&rsquo;s will to be done on earth, because this is God&rsquo;s desire, and in chapter 24 the Lord spoke of His desire for the gospel to be preached in the whole inhabited earth (v. 14). This is the reason that all authority in heaven and on earth was given to the Lord Jesus. Possessing this authority, the Lord charged the disciples to preach the gospel to all the nations until the consummation of this age (28:18-20). This is also His charge to the church.</p>
<p>The Lord has been with the church since the time of His resurrection. He is exercising His authority so that the church can preach His gospel to all the nations. When we spread the gospel, God&rsquo;s will is being done on earth. Only by spreading the gospel can God&rsquo;s will be done on earth as it is being done in heaven. Therefore, God desires that we would spread the gospel in Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR LIMITATION</h2>
<p>God wants us to spread His gospel, but very few saints have such a deep feeling. Therefore, we are spreading the gospel in a limited manner, both corporately and individually. Although we serve together, meet frequently, and pray that God&rsquo;s will would be done on earth, do we have a strong desire to preach the gospel? How much do we fulfill our function by preaching the gospel? God has commissioned us with the gospel, but we have hindered Him, held Him back, and limited Him.</p>
<p>The Lord has prepared the geographical location, transportation, manpower, people&rsquo;s hearts, and financial support for us. These items are in wonderful coordination together. In the past twenty years of my service to the Lord, I have not seen a situation in which the Lord provided so much. The place where we are is stable and free, transportation is accessible and convenient, the manpower is adequate, people&rsquo;s hearts are hungry, and the financial support is sufficient. However, our function in the gospel is minimal, even though there is no lack.</p>
<p>We have failed the Lord and limited Him; hence, we are indebted to Him. We should not think that we have done so much for the Lord. A brother recently said to me, &ldquo;The number of baptisms in one of our meetings exceeds the number baptized in fifty years in a certain denomination.&rdquo; We do not need to compare ourselves with others, nor do we need to boast. We need to humble ourselves and examine ourselves before God. We did not accomplish anything, and we have nothing for which to boast. On the contrary, we have limited and hindered the Lord. I believe that all the saints would admit that we have limited and hindered the Lord, because we have not allowed Him to flow through us adequately.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR LOOSENESS LIMITING THE LORD</h2>
<p>On the one hand, we need to acknowledge that we have limited the Lord, but on the other hand, we must know how we limit Him. The responsible brothers in the churches often tell me that they are incapable; therefore, they ask me to send brothers from Taipei to help them. They say that the churches are not doing well because no one is sent to help. The responsible brothers say that they are incapable and weak. It is good to admit that we are incapable and weak, but still we must know the source of our problem.</p>
<p>The problem is in us. We need to consider the specific aspects of this problem so that we can go to the Lord and be enlightened through His judgment. Some brothers say that the Lord is limited by our unfaithfulness and by our unwillingness to give Him our heart. Others say that we love the world, are selfish, and are unwilling to abandon and give up the self. Although these factors are present, they are not the source. If we consider the saints among us, we cannot say that they do not have a heart or have not given up the self. Nevertheless, they are not that active in the gospel.</p>
<p>If we sense before the Lord that the above points apply to us, we should judge and condemn these things. Although we often sense that we have these problems, we let them go instead of judging and condemning them. This shows that we are loose. Therefore, the Lord is limited by our looseness. This is our problem. Here is an example of looseness. The meeting is scheduled to begin at nine o&rsquo;clock, but a brother arrives at ten minutes after nine. Perhaps the brother would say that it does not matter that he is ten minutes late to the meeting. However, if we are loose in relation to the time of a meeting, we will be loose in everything. If we are ten minutes late to a meeting, then as a rule, we should have a deep feeling concerning this and come early for the next meeting. Such a response shows that we are strict with ourselves, not loose. How many among us are strict in this way?</p>
<p>If we are under the Lord&rsquo;s light, we will see that even though we love the Lord and have surrendered ourselves to Him, the meetings are not blessed and the work lacks fruit because of our looseness. Many blessings have slipped away in our service because of our looseness. We cannot say that the saints who serve do not love the Lord or have not surrendered themselves to Him. To say this would be an injustice to them. However, their service does not bring in much blessing, and their work does not produce much fruit, nor does it meet the expected goal, because of looseness.</p>
<p>Many things among us have been delayed because of our looseness. When we sense that we still love the world, we do not deal with it because of looseness. If we were stricter, we would deal with our love of the world, and the world would fall away from us. For example, when we anticipate that five hundred people will attend a gospel meeting, but only three hundred attend, we are still satisfied and peaceful. This response shows that we are loose. A strict person would not respond in this way. He would not be peaceful. This is strictness. If we do not have such a response to the low attendance, there is looseness in our being. We have never been pressed or constricted. Because we are loose, we can be satisfied when the attendance is low. If we were strict, we would find the cause instead of letting the matter go.</p>
<p>I have often seen brothers preaching the gospel as if they had a fishing rod and were waiting for the fish to bite the hook. Some brothers do not even use a hook; they wait for the fish to jump into the net. How loose this is! Because of such looseness, they are unable to bring people to salvation, and they miss the opportunities to save many souls. Some saints always use their own dialect when speaking with people. They do not care that others may not understand. This shows that these saints are loose. If they were strict, they would realize that people do not understand their dialect and would speak so that others could understand and receive help.</p>
<p>Those who serve the Lord have indeed paid a price and love the Lord. However, our looseness is a serious problem that has caused us to lose many blessings that we should have received. Our looseness can ruin everything. We should not look for a great problem. As long as there is a hole in a one-gallon bucket, a gallon of gasoline will leak out, even if the hole is as small as the eye of a needle. Our little hole of looseness has caused many blessings to leak out.</p>
<p>When we are strict, our service becomes three-dimensional. When we are loose, our service becomes two-dimensional, and all the blessings leak out. If we would be a little stricter with ourselves, our service would become three-dimensional, and the blessings would be kept.</p>
<p>Many saints are unable to solve their spiritual problems because they are loose; they cannot cross over a spiritual threshold because they are loose. Because we are loose, our meetings often are not up to the standard. Sometimes the wrong hymn is called, or sometimes the correct hymn is called a few minutes late. Sometimes no prayer is offered when there should be prayer, or prayer is offered at the wrong time. This is an indication of looseness. Looseness causes the spiritual &ldquo;air&rdquo; to leak out of our spiritual service.</p>
<p>May the Lord lead us into His light so that we may see the extent of our looseness. We fulfill only twenty percent of our spiritual function, but we are not concerned. Instead of condemning our looseness, we excuse ourselves by saying that we are incapable and that we are weak. We should not be proud, but to continually say that we are incapable is looseness, not humility. If we are incapable, we should weep desperately before God and pray together with others with fasting so that we would deal with our incapability in a serious and thorough way. We say that we are incapable, but we are not desperate before the Lord, and we do not fast and pray. We are incapable because we are loose.</p>
<p>We say that our meetings are not up to standard, but we are satisfied instead of being desperate. As a result, the attendance in the meetings continues to drop. Some brothers say that they cannot preach the gospel because of their love for the world, but they do not deal with the world. Some brothers are fleshly, some have a narrow heart, and some cannot coordinate. The brothers may have some feeling concerning their problems, but they do not deal with the problems. This is the result of looseness. Because we are loose, we do not deal with our problems. As a result, in the church and in the work many blessings are lost.</p>
<p>I believe that the Lord will bless Taiwan. Many local people will hear the gospel and taste His salvation, and churches will be established in various localities. However, our looseness prevents Him from moving freely and quickly. Our looseness limits Him. If a few saints in every locality would be strict with themselves, there would be a drastic change in the local churches. May the Lord enlighten us to see how much our looseness limits Him. Because of our looseness, the Lord has no way to move, His work cannot propagate, and many saints in the church do not receive shepherding or nurturing. The saints attend the meetings, but they do not have the heart to serve God. If the responsible saints were stricter, we would be dissatisfied with our situation. We would pray with fasting and seek the Lord concerning the source of our problems. Then we would see our mistakes and our lack.</p>
<p>Often, because we are so loose, I cannot say Amen to prayers that ask the Lord to work. The Lord wants to work, but our looseness frustrates Him. Our prayers need to change. We do not need to ask the Lord to work; we need to ask Him to shine on our looseness. This is the root of the problem. How can the Lord work if we do not deal with our looseness?</p>
<p>A saint once prayed that we have no way if the Lord does not work. Such a prayer is spiritual, but the person who uttered this prayer does not get up until eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning. This is looseness. If we are loose, the Lord has no way to move. We have been praying for the Lord to work for ten years, but the Lord still does not have a way. Instead of dealing strictly with ourselves, we are relaxed. If we would be a little stricter, the Lord would have a way, our meetings would improve, the work would be blessed, more souls would be saved, and many saints would be edified.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s work in us is hindered by our looseness. We love the Lord, but we are loose. According to what we have offered to the Lord, we should have very good results, but our looseness has canceled everything. Our looseness is a great problem in our service and work.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Serving According to Revelation &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
