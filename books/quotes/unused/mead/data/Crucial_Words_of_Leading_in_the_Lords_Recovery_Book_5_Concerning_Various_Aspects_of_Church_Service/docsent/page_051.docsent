   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Full-timers Not Being the Hirelings of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the administration of the full-time brothers and sisters, they are not directed by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 13:1-3 says, There were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers...And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This portion of the Scriptures does not mention elders; it speaks only of five prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As they were fasting and praying, the Lord set Barnabas and Saul apart to work in the Gentile lands.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter 14 Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We believe that the local church in Antioch must have provided for their needs on the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only the five prophets and teachers took part in sending out some, but the whole church supported them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Barnabas and Saul finished their work, they returned to the church and fellowshipped with the church concerning what happened during their trip.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This clearly indicates that the full-timers are not hired by the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The full-timers produced by a local church are supported by that local church, but the local church does not hire them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither should the churches direct the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The authority to direct the full-timers rests with the co-workers in all the localities, just as it did in the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The prophets and teachers bore the responsibility of sending out the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, it is rather simple and practical to send people out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no need of an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We hope that all the saints will take action.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who should resign from their jobs, should resign, and those who should close their shops, should close them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The saints should hand over their lives to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever people are enlisted for warfare, there will be people who donate supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever people offer their lives, there will be people who offer their money.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The elders should take action by considering how to support all the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The co-workers should also bear the responsibility of equipping them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the full-time brothers and sisters go to the various towns and villages, they do not need to be involved in many activities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They should first take a look at the local situation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is good if there are saints who can receive them; otherwise, they may rent a place.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every place the saints visit for the work will become a gospel station of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The full-timers should begin the work there and lead eight to ten people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, the gospel station will become a small church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All nine thousand saints who regularly meet should do their best to offer manpower and finances, and we should use the seventy-seven local churches as bases and centers to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Unless we are unfaithful in these matters, it will be easy to evangelize Taiwan in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BEING FAITHFUL IN MATERIAL OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the teaching of the Bible concerning material offerings, every person who belongs to the Lord should regularly give one-tenth of his income as an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From church history and the biographies of the saints, as well as from my own experience, I can testify that whoever practices giving one-tenth of his income, according to the Lord s word, will never suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not be greedy, however, and think that if we would give the Lord a little more, He will give us more in return.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If that is our thought, we are truly and genuinely Jacobs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are all descendants of Jacob who have bargained with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In spite of that, the Lord still remembers what we offer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Throughout the centuries, every saint who gave one-tenth of their income, according to God s word, was blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, some will even give two-tenths or three-tenths.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we give, the more we want to give.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if our earnings are barely enough to meet our needs, we still must give one-tenth to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our income may be short a little, but we will see the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In addition to the regular giving of one-tenth, in the Old Testament there is also the giving for special occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After giving one-tenth, some brothers and sisters who have a higher income will have more than enough left over.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These saints should not consider what they give for the construction of a large meeting hall as part of their regular giving.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some saints may think that our God extorts high taxes, because there is the first kind of tithe, a second kind of tithe, and other tithes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A person could give a tithe during the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Malachi says, Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What we give to the Lord is merely one-tenth of our income, but the Lord opens the windows of heaven and pours out manifold blessings on us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some saints are not willing to give the Lord the one-tenth that He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, the Lord shuts up heaven and makes heaven like bronze and the earth like iron; there is no rain from heaven and no produce on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 1958 I visited Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I saw the land there, a reverence for God welled up in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This was the land that God promised would be flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A cluster of grapes produced from that land had to be carried by two people on a pole Num 13:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, what I saw outside of Jerusalem was nothing but small pebbles.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The wind had blown away all the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The land was so arid that nothing could grow in it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The grapes produced were so small that not only was there no need for two people to carry a cluster, but one person could carry twenty clusters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we need to fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everything that the Bible says will be completely fulfilled in time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not bargain with God; otherwise, He will shut the windows of heaven.</S>
