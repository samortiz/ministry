   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO PRONOUNS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Please note the pronouns in verses 17 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 17 says that "He" shall be in you, while verse 18 says that "I" am coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the relationship between the He in verse 17 and the I in verse 18?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do they qualify as two persons or one?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is best for us to read the two verses again to find out who the "He" and the "I" are in verses 17 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I were to tell you something like this, "A man just stopped a taxi by the city hall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He paid five dollars and had the driver bring him here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I arrived, I ran in and saw all of you sitting here, and I began to preach."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please tell me what would be the relationship between that man and me?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, that man is I and I am that man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is just a different way of mentioning the same person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise the "I" in verse 18 is the same one as the "He" in verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The meaning of this passage is clear; the Lord will ask the Father, and the Father will send a Comforter to your midst.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This Comforter, who is the Holy Spirit, is just the Christ that will dwell inside of you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way the disciples will no longer remain orphans.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a most precious portion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Christ was on the earth, the Holy Spirit, who is the Comforter, lived inside of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After His death, resurrection, and ascension, He lives inside the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Christ was with the disciples on earth, the Holy Spirit was with the disciples already, for the Spirit was inside Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But what happened after those days?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By His death and resurrection, Christ is now in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, He is coming to His disciples by the Spirit, through the Spirit, and in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may say that the Holy Spirit is now in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But actually it is Christ in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why in the first part of this portion it says, "He...shall be in you," but then the latter part changes to "I am coming to you."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The "I" is in the "He."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE HAND IN THE GLOVE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One time I was talking to a friend of mine in Kaifeng concerning Christ's being in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A foreign lady happened to come by.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She greeted me and was about to take off her gloves to shake my hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I rushed up to her and said, "There is no need to take off your gloves."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I held up the hand with the glove and turned to my friend, asking, "Am I holding the glove or the hand?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may say that I am holding her glove, but I am actually holding her hand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The relationship between Christ and the Holy Spirit is exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you outwardly take hold of the Spirit, you are actually possessing Christ inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Receiving the Holy Spirit is the same as receiving Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My friend nodded his head and said, "Now I see!"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is similar to what we said earlier about the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may say that He is God and also say that He is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When you touch His divinity, you cannot avoid touching His humanity also.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When His humanity is manifested, His divinity simultaneously comes forth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the same way, Christ and the Spirit are one inseparable entity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You may interchange the two terms as synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit is in Him, and He is in the Spirit.</S>
