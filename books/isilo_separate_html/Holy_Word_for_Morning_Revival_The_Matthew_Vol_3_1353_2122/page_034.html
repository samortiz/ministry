The term &#8220;the daughter&#8221; of Zion in 21:5 denotes the people of Jerusalem (cf. Psa. 137:8; 45:12). This prophecy was being fulfilled to them.</p><p>Verse 5 says that the King came &#8220;mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden.&#8221; This signifies the humble and lowly state in which the King of the heavenly kingdom was willing to remain....The heavenly King came not with haughty splendor, but with gentle, humble meekness. This impression of meekness is strengthened by the colt accompanying a donkey to bear the meek King. The Lord Jesus did not ride into Jerusalem proudly on a horse. He came mounted upon a little donkey, even a small colt. No earthly king would do this....[He] came not to fight or to compete, but to be a meek King. The presence of the baby donkey testified that the Lord did not care to fight or compete with anyone.</p><p>The people honored the Lord with their clothing, that is, with whatever they had....We need to honor the Lord, the meek King, with whatever we are. No matter what our condition may be, we have something with which to honor Him.... [Furthermore], the people shouted out a quotation from Psalm 118: &#8220;Blessed is He who comes in the name of Jehovah&#8221; (v. 26). According to Psalm 118, only the One who came in the name of the Lord was qualified to be praised in such a way. Thus, the spontaneous praise of the people sovereignly indicated that this meek King came not in His own name, but in the name of Jehovah.
