<h2 class=head2>The Content of the Entire New Testament Being the Spirit</h2><p>The sequence of the four Gospels is wonderful. At the beginning Matthew says that Mary conceived through the Holy Spirit and brought forth a God-man; at the end John says that this God-man became the Spirit and was breathed into His disciples. At the conclusion of the Gospels, the God-man Jesus, who brought divinity into humanity through incarnation and who also brought humanity into divinity through death and resurrection, became the Spirit. As such, He breathed Himself into His disciples as their life and everything and sent them with His commission, qualifying them to represent Him with His authority for the carrying out of His commission (John 20:22-23; Matt. 28:18-20).<p>After the four Gospels, there is the book of Acts. Acts is altogether a story of the Spirit. Many Bible readers recognize that the Acts of the apostles is the Acts of the Spirit and the biography of the Spirit. In Acts 16:7 we see a new term, the Spirit of Jesus. Do not think that the Spirit of Jesus is different from the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of Jesus and the Holy Spirit in the preceding verse are used interchangeably, revealing that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a general title of the Spirit of God, while the Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross. This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and His suffering of death. When Paul and his company of co-workers went out preaching in their ministry, they were led and controlled by the Spirit of Jesus.<p>After the book of Acts, there are the Epistles, and the first book of the Epistles is Romans. Romans 8:9 says of the Spirit of Christ, “If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.” The Spirit of Jesus is related mainly to the Lord’s humanity and human living with its sufferings and death, while the Spirit of Christ is related mainly to the Lord’s resurrection and power of life. Then in Philippians 1:19 we see the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the Spirit mentioned in John 7:39, the Spirit related to death and resurrection, in whom is the bountiful supply, having the element of death, the effectiveness of death, the element of resurrection, and the effectiveness of the resurrection power. Such a Spirit has the bountiful supply and even is the bountiful supply. The fourteen Epistles of Paul all speak at some length concerning this Spirit.<p>In Revelation, the last book of the Bible, the Holy Spirit is not mentioned at all. The term the Holy Spirit cannot be found anywhere in the entire book of Revelation. Rather, it speaks of “the Spirit.” In chapters two and three it is the Spirit speaking to the seven churches: “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches” (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). Then 14:13 says, “Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.” It does not say here “says the Scripture” but “says the Spirit.” Where does the Spirit say such a word? It is not in the air or on the throne in the heavens but in the believers. After the believers see and hear the matter of suffering martyrdom for the Lord, there is a voice out of heaven, saying, “Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” At that time the Spirit responds and acknowledges in the believers, saying, “Yes.”<p>At the end of the Bible, Revelation 22:17 says, “The Spirit and the bride say, Come!” It does not say “the Spirit and the bride both say,” but “the Spirit and the bride say,” indicating that the Spirit and the bride have become one. In the beginning of Revelation it was the Spirit speaking to the churches; then it was the Spirit speaking in the church, the believers; and at the end it is the Spirit and the bride, the church, speaking together as one. This indicates that the church’s experience of the Spirit has advanced to such an extent that she has become one with the Spirit. Hence, the entire Bible consummates with the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. The Triune God came through incarnation and passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.
