   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO GROW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the best way, actually the only way, to help children grow?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the mothers know the best way is not to teach them, but to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Feeding, not teaching, causes children to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why Paul said, "I fed you" 1 Cor 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can we likewise perfect the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not merely teach them; we should feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul planted and Apollos watered 1 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To water the plant is simply to feed it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What the churches as the kingdom need for the perfecting of the saints is not teaching but feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As mothers know, little ones are perfected year after year by growth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because of this growth they are able to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this does not mean that the children lacked the organs before the perfecting work began.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It simply means they lacked the ability.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This ability comes only by perfecting, and perfecting comes from the feeding which helps them grow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such feeding is what all the churches as the kingdom need today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TEACHINGS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AND GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After hearing some of my messages, a few people were offended and argued, saying, "You say that we don't need teachings, gifts, or regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Don't you think that the teachings are helpful?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are the gifts not needed?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Don't you think that some of the regulations are good?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My response is that it all depends on how you use them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These things are all right if they help people to grow, but the tragedy is that many Bible teachers help people only to know the Bible, not to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I know this from experience, because I was under the best Bible teaching for seven and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During that period I did not have the slightest amount of growth in life as a result of that teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many others have had the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps, in some exceptional cases, Bible teachings helped people grow a little.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, they did not help very much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything depends on whether the teaching affords people the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The same is true with the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was personally involved with them, especially with tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am sorry to say that I did not witness the genuine growth in life among the people who spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not criticizing or despising, but I must be faithful and honest to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Check with so many of the people who speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where is the growth?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today the churches as the kingdom of God need something to help them grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If speaking in tongues can help the saints grow in life, I am for it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I myself dropped it because I found that it produced no growth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Speaking in tongues may stir up your heart and your spirit, but once you have been stirred up you must immediately turn to life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, you will be hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regardless of how much you exercise your gifts, you will remain hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Speaking in tongues will never feed you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may say that it gives some satisfaction, but do you have the growth?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even growth by itself is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The proper growth produces transformation, a genuine change in life, a metabolic change in your being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Transformation is the true proof of your growth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Following transformation comes the building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The real growth produces transformation, and transformation issues in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the contrary, most people who speak in tongues are very independent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thank the Lord if you have received help from speaking in tongues, but if you remain there you may become independent and individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I know these things from my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I was involved with them and saw them for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the meetings held for the exercise of spiritual gifts, most people do not care for others; everyone cares for his own practice of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In their daily living as well, it is very difficult for tongues-speaking people to be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Throughout the history of the church, no one has been more divisive than tongues-speaking people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nearly every tongues-speaker is a division in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In spite of this, there is a kind of assurance among tongues-speaking people that, if all the believers will speak in tongues, all will be one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>History proves the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is not the proper oneness among tongues-speaking people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What we need today is the proper growth which results in transformation and building.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This will produce the real oneness.</S>
