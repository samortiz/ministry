In judging others, there is a basic qualification&mdash;we first must be judged thoroughly by God. I cannot pass on a method of judging others to you. The only thing I can say is that our knowledge of others is based on our knowledge of ourselves. If we do not know ourselves, we cannot know others. If we are thoroughly judged by God, we will easily know the brothers and sisters when we see them. When a man's spirit is released, we immediately will know whether his spirit is right or wrong. We must learn the lesson ourselves, and we must pass through the judgment personally. When we have had the inward experience, we will be able to detect that sickness when others are in similar predicaments. If we circumvent a lesson, we will be insensitive to the same thing when others fall into its snare; we will easily excuse them. But if we have been deeply touched by God in that matter, we will be alarmed as soon as it surfaces in others. Hence, the basis of our knowledge of men is the kind of judgments we have experienced ourselves. The more we know ourselves, the more we will know the brothers and sisters. If we have never been judged ourselves, we will not be able to do anything even if we apply all the methods of judgment to others. We can never lead others through something we have never experienced ourselves. If we have passed through enough dealings ourselves, we will be able to identify the trouble spots in others as soon as they appear. We will know exactly where their problem lies. Since we have gone down the same road, we will know what to do.</p><p>We should seek to experience more dealings. The more experience we have, the more we will know the brothers and sisters. Otherwise, we will be in the dark even when our brothers and sisters are in error. We have to be dealt with by the Holy Spirit in all things great or small. Whatever we have passed through ourselves will be easily picked up by our discernment when others experience the same thing. All men are alike. They are all similar in temperament, nature, and likes. There is not much novelty in the way men commit errors and sin. Everyone is a descendant of Adam and knows all the "tricks" that came with Adam. Once we are enlightened to know ourselves, we will know almost everyone in the whole world. Please remember that every descendant of Adam has the full range of Adamic attributes within him. If we are experienced in discerning ourselves, it will be easy for us to diagnose others. Do not think that we can know men simply by acquiring certain skills. We must learn the lessons ourselves before the methods will become meaningful to us. How useful we are to others depends on how much dealing we have received from the Lord ourselves. Every area that we have circumvented will be an area that we cannot touch in others. We should not be so foolish as to think that we can run away from this "school." If we run away, we will forfeit our spiritual usefulness.</p><p>What is ministry? Ministry is learning some lessons before the Lord and then ministering them to others. If we have not learned anything, we will not have anything to minister to others. All of our environments, arrangements, and disciplines are for equipping us for the ministry. The discipline of the Holy Spirit always increases the riches of the ministry. If we experience little, we can render little help to others. If we experience much suffering and discipline, we will be able to bear much burden, and we will lead others into rich experiences. The scope of our ministry is dictated by the amount of discipline we have received from the Holy Spirit. If we have not learned much, we will only be able to speak to the brothers and sisters in a frivolous way. Our words will not hit home; they will not be sharp and pointed enough to produce any result. If we have learned the lesson ourselves, we will know if others have passed the test. They will not be able to cheat us. In preaching the gospel we will know whether others are saved; they will not be able to cheat us in the matter of salvation. But the same can be said of deeper spiritual experiences. Everything depends on the amount of lessons and experiences we have learned. Those who learn more will know others more. They will know what is wrong with a brother as soon as they contact him. In order to fulfill our ministry of serving the Lord, I beg all of us to place ourselves in God's hand willingly and unreservedly and to receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit. If we are not inwardly built up, we cannot perform any outward work. God does everything within man. He does not work on man's mind alone. We cannot become preachers merely by studying the Bible for two or three years. It would be easy for the Lord to charge His disciples to recite His sermons, but He did not do this. Instead He gave them some practical training.</p><p>We want to know men for the purpose of ministering to them. We are not here to satisfy our curiosity. Our purpose is to build, not to destroy. We have no time to mind others' business. We seek to know men for the purpose of meeting their needs only. In order to become a useful vessel, we have to commit ourselves unconditionally, unreservedly, and willingly to the Lord's hand. We have to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The more we accept, the more useful we will become. Every discipline we receive will increase our capacity and usefulness a little. We must not only seek to teach doctrines. We have to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Only then will we be able to lead others into spiritual riches.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 58: Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
