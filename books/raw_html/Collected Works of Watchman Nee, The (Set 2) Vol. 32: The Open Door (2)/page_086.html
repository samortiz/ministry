<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>The Lord has indeed blessed me through my illness. He has also blessed the brothers and sisters. We have all received the proper lessons and profit before the Lord. The condition of my sickness was actually more serious than it was in Tientsin. But the Lord heard our cry and showed mercy to my weakness. He proved His victory. Within the shortest possible period of time, I became well again, and there is only a little cough left in me. Please pray much for us.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chao Bi-chen</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother K. H. Weigh, K'un-ming</h2><p>The meetings here are going on as before. The gospel meeting on the Lord's Day afternoon has improved much. Thank the Lord for His leading. On Friday we have a meeting for the saints. The focus of this meeting is on Bible study. Presently, we are studying Matthew. We are studying it chapter by chapter (one or two chapters each week). During the week the brothers and sisters read the chapters at home. When they come together, each takes a turn reading a verse. Then they have mutual exhortation and edification according to the leading of the Spirit. According to the practice of the past two weeks, it seems that this kind of meeting combines the functions of edification, Bible study, and testifying. Most of the brothers and sisters apply the exposition of the Scriptures to their daily living. But the Lord also leads some brothers to speak something on the side of knowledge. During the past two meetings, I have received much edification from the mouths of the brothers and sisters. Some light is new to me. May the Lord continue to bless this kind of meeting so that all the glory goes to God. Recently, I have felt that the meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14 is an important kind of meeting in the local church. But I am still not clear as to how this kind of meeting should be conducted. I hope to receive some help from some brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Thank and praise the Lord for His leading and arrangement. He has prepared a suitable gospel hall in the heart of K'un-ming for us. (This is something the workers are responsible for.) We have been having gospel meetings continuously for a few evenings. The house is not very big, and the meetings appear to be very crowded. Every night the Lord works, and some repent and receive Him. After the Chinese New Year, the Lord willing, I intend to go to west Yunnan to do some work there. Brother Jiang Shun-chin from Yau-An County wrote a few times asking me to go and preach the gospel at the beginning of the next Chinese New Year. I helped the two brothers from Norway go to Da-Li. Is there any news from Brother Nee? When will he return home?</p><p>Brother Kwang-hsi, February 9</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chen Hsi-wen, K'un-ming</h2><p>I went to Shan-Cha River on January 25. Later, I returned to Luh-Liang. On the twenty-eighth I left Luh-Liang and arrived at Yi-Liang on the twenty-ninth. On the thirtieth I returned to K'un-ming. It takes two days to travel from Chu-Jing to Luh-Liang. Luh-Liang, Ma-Jie, and Shan-Cha River are thirty miles apart from each another. Ma-Jie is more important, and the population is larger. Shi-Jung County is eight miles from Ma-Jei, and it is smaller than Luh-Liang. I have heard that a Western missionary worked there once but left after a short time. I have also heard that there are no believers in the town, but there are two or three sisters and a Brother Chao and his family in the villages twenty miles from the town. I have met with Brother Chao and have tried to find out about his situation. Although they were persecuted, they are still standing for the Lord. We thank the Lord for this.</p><p>It is one hundred miles from Shi-Jung to Lo-Ping. This county is larger than Shi-Jung and has a bigger population. No one is preaching the gospel there. From Lo-Ping I went to Ban-Chiao, which is a distance of fifty-five miles. This is the main way to enter Kweichow. When Brother Chou Hung-bao, Sister Chen Huei-sien, and I went to these places to conduct open-air evangelization, many came to listen to us. Although we have not seen fruit yet, the seed of the gospel has been spread. The work in Yunnan is indeed important. May the Lord send more workers to this region to do some long-term work. They will surely see results.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Hsi-wen, February 8</p><h2 class="head2">A Conference in Pu-Han, Fukien Province</h2><p>Between October 6 and 23 of last year, Brothers Chen Ke-san, Tsai Tse-chung, and Lan Jin-yang went to Hwei-An, Tseng-Mao, Dong-Yuen, and Bai-Chi under God's sovereignty. In Bai-Chi they rented temporary places and conducted gospel meetings for a few days. The Spirit did some clear work. Unfortunately, the harvest is ripe but the workers are few. On October 24 Brothers Chen Ke-san and Tsai Tse-chung went to Chuenchow and then worked in An-Hai, Jiu-Du, Chuenchow, Shi-Shee, etc., separately or together. Finally, they went to work in Sien-You. Everything was under the Lord's leading. May glory be to the Father and to the Lord Jesus Christ, amen! (Ke-san, etc., returned on December 13.) During this period of time, Brother Jai-seng and a few brothers and sisters spent most of their time doing pioneering work around Wu-Tung. From December 26 to January 4, the three of us had a special conference in Pu-Tien. The Lord was gracious to us. Glory to His name! We also conducted conferences in Han River on January 16-29. The attendance came from the three counties of Fu-Ching, Pu-Tien, and Sien-You. The number of saints filled seven or eight tables. What a joy it was when those of us from various places met together and fellowshipped in the Lord! The conference in Han River had three meetings a day. The Lord showed us our poverty and pitiful condition, and then He showed us the fullness and riches in Christ. We also studied the book of Ephesians, which shows God's eternal purpose. Finally, we had exhortation for our daily living. Thank the Lord that in His faithfulness and mercy, He has graced the church here, and the Spirit has granted them gifts of prophecy, healing, etc. May glory be unto Him forever and ever, amen! Finally, we were taught of the Spirit and received the same revelation to soberly and carefully appoint elders and deacons in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. (The elders are Brothers Fang Shi-rong and Fang Jia-je.) We fasted and prayed and committed them to the faithful Lord. The church has been properly established, and there has been a clear line drawn between the church and the work. May the Lord gain the preeminence in the church, and may He receive the rich inheritance and glory, amen! At the end of the conference, believers were revived, sinners were saved, and sick ones were healed. The conference in Pu-Tien was more or less the same. (The elders that were appointed are Chu Ai-tseng and Lin Gao.) Through this experience we learned a little about being co-workers together. We realized the danger of working alone and saw the benefits of working together, including: (1) mutual edification, (2) mutual correction, (3) mutual learning, and (4) mutual help. Our future is in the Lord's hand.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Chen Ke-san, Chen Jsai-seng, Chai Tze-chung<br />February 8</p>
