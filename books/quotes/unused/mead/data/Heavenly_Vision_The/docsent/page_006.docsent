   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Having the First Place in Everything</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Colossians 1:15-18 reveals that Christ must have the first place, the preeminence, in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ Being the Essence of Our Daily Walk</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see clearly that Christ must be the essence, the substance, of our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that the essence of our daily walk is not humility or patience or love or kindness or good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The essence of all these virtues must be Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our humility must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our patience must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our love must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our kindness must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our good behavior must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we see such a vision of Christ, we will never help others to have humility, patience, love, and kindness without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will never help them to be good without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, we will minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will testify to others that Christ, the essence, the substance, of our daily walk, is humility, patience, love, kindness, and good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ Being the Reality of Our Service</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ must also be the reality of our service, the reality of our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No matter what kind of service we may do or what kind of ministry we may have, the reality of that service and ministry must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not minister knowledge and forms to others or impart gifts to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, we should minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not easy to minister only Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Try to cease from ministering knowledge, forms, and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do this, you may find that you have nothing to minister, for your ministry is full of knowledge, forms, and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you desert these things, you find that nothing remains.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I would ask you to check your ministry in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ's being the reality of our ministry and service includes His being the reality of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we preach the gospel to sinners, we must have Christ as the reality of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that we should not merely preach the gospel but should preach the gospel with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is the gospel, and we should preach Him to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need the vision of Christ as the reality of our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need the vision to see that our ministry must be full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I come to contact a brother in order to have fellowship with him, I must not have only the knowledge of the Word but must have Christ as the reality of this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The knowledge of the Word is the means by which Christ is conveyed to this dear brother.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Knowledge, forms, and gifts should simply be the means to convey Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may say that such things are the "wrappings" used in "packing" Christ as the content.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose you buy a diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The diamond is placed in a container, and then the container is wrapped.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Neither the container nor the wrappings is the reality of the diamond which you have bought.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reality of the wrappings and the container is the diamond itself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you take away the wrappings and the container, you will still have the diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, with many so-called ministries today, once the "wrappings" and the "container" of teachings, forms, and gifts are removed, there is nothing left.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no "diamond."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because this is the situation, I say once again that we need to have the vision of Christ as the reality of our ministry and service.</S>
