   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider the truth concerning the ministry in the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ONE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the eyes of the Lord there is just one ministry in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Speaking of the need of a replacement for Judas, Peter said that Judas was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry Acts 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The twelve Apostles were all in this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that there is one unique ministry in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Years ago, I did not see this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But because of the controversy regarding receiving the ministry of others, I have spent time to study the pure Word regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My eyes have been opened to see that the twelve Apostles were all in this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, when the Apostles prayed about a replacement for Judas, they asked the Lord to show them whom He had chosen to take part of this ministry Acts 1:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may argue that this ministry is limited to the twelve Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Ephesians 4:11 and 12 say, And he gave some apostles; and some prophets; and some evangelists; and some shepherds and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of the ministry, to the building up of the body of Christ Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>. Verse 11 is related to the whole period of time from the Apostles until the Lord s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God s New Testament economy there are many apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout the centuries, there have been thousands of them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, all of them have been given for the perfecting of the saints to the work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Notice that verse 12 does not say the work of the ministries, but says the work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although there are thousands of gifted persons, all are for the work of the one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the New Testament age, God s unique intention is to build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God created the universe, formed man, and accomplished redemption all for this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this one purpose, God has one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God does not have two operations in this New Testament age; He has one operation with one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The ministry in the New Testament economy is a corporate ministry, a ministry that includes thousands of gifted people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, in 2 Corinthians 4:1 Paul said, We have this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul did not say, I have this ministry, nor, We have these ministries ; he said, We have this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul, his co-workers, and the other apostles all had this ministry, the one ministry in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 2 Corinthians 3:6 Paul says that God made us able ministers of the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ministry is the service; all the ministers are the serving ones carrying out this service.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The many ministers do not have many services, but one service, one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I like Paul s word in 1 Timothy 1:12: I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this verse Paul does not say, He put me into my ministry ; he says that the Lord put him into the one unique, corporate New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all need to praise the Lord that by His mercy and grace He has put us into the corporate ministry that builds up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>PERSONAL MINISTRY AND CORPORATE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although these verses reveal that the ministry in the New Testament is corporate, certain other verses seem to indicate that the ministry is personal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Acts 20:24 Paul says, But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This verse refers to Paul s personal ministry because Paul speaks of the ministry which he had received of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, the ministry in this verse is the personal ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Acts 21:19, definitely and clearly refers to Paul s personal ministry: And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Other verses that seem to refer to personal ministry are 2 Timothy 4:5 and Colossians 4:17.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 2 Timothy 4:5 Paul charged Timothy, Fulfill thy ministry Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>, apparently encouraging him to fulfill his personal ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Colossians 4:17 says, And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This evidently points to Archippus personal ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In considering the verses that speak of personal ministry, we need to realize that all the believers are members of the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a whole, the Body has one corporate ministry, not many ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although there are many functions in the Body, the ministry in the Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, when I speak, my whole body speaks: my eyes, nose, ears, arms, fingers, legs, and feet are all involved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, my speaking is my body s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This ministry is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, each part of my body also has its own ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The mouth speaks, the hands make gestures, and the feet render support.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But when the ministries of all the members are added together, they total the unique ministry of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This example indicates that the many ministries of the members of the Body are not separate ministries but part of one corporate ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The New Testament ministry is uniquely one and corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But because this ministry is the service of the Body of Christ and because the Body has many members, every member has its own ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, according to the members, there are many ministries; however, according to the Body as a whole, there is just one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Your ministry should not be separate from the corporate ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Body has a corporate ministry, and all the members of the Body have their individual ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As we have seen, all the ministries of the members added together equal the corporate ministry.</S>
