   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON THE MOUNTAIN Date:Friday evening, February 17, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee TAKING THE WAY OF RECOVERY ACCORDING TO</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE PATTERN ON THE MOUNTAIN</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Watchman Nee: The Lord's intention concerning the church is one that is according to "the pattern on the mountain."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A church must find out what the pattern on the mountain is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It must take God's standard as its standard before it will realize how wrong it has been.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the condition of the church that we are trying to match?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only as our eyes are drawn to the glorious church ordained by the Lord in the Scripture will we realize our shortage and lack.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Reason for the Church's Failure</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The basic reason for the failure of the church is that it cannot meet its own need of begetting and nourishing the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Changes in membership of a church should not come solely as a result of movement of saints to and from other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a church is strong, the number of brothers and sisters moving out of the church is small.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a church is weak, the number of brothers and sisters moving out of the church is great.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A businessman pays much attention to the influx and outflow of economic forces such as capital.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A church also should pay much attention to the influx and outflow of its members.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A church may have three to four hundred brothers and sisters, but it may be very short in care and shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a year's time, many new ones are added, but many old ones leave also.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a drain on the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, a church must not only be good at preaching the gospel and gaining new ones, but must give itself to edifying the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first responsibility of the church is to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second responsibility is to perfect and nourish men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a church saves a hundred people in a few months, yet loses a hundred at the same time, it is a total failure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the reason I say that a church's failure lies in its inability to keep the children it has begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Law of the Work of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a church is strong, it will be in full control of everything; it can dictate at will the number of sinners it saves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order for the church to be strong, it has to work according to the pattern on the mountain, a pattern which the Lord revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If it does not work according to the Lord's pattern, it will be very hard to bring in men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if the church works according to the Lord's pattern, it can tell itself to increase by five hundred, and it will increase by five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Or it can tell itself to increase by a thousand, and it will increase by a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we take the Lord's way, it will not be a surprise to save three or five hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It will not be a surprise to even save three or five thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some of our brothers call the Lord "the Son of Revival."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether or not He is the Son of Revival depends on whether we work according to the law which He has revealed to us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who know the law according to which the Lord works agree with my word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the church knows the law of the Spirit and works according to this law in preaching the gospel, it will experience no obstacles in its saving work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once the church rises to the standard, men are saved and revival comes.</S>
