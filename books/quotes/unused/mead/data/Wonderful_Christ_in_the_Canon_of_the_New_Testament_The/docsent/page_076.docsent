   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A STRONG BASE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today is a day of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have a strong base for the things we minister.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I admit that so many items are very new.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we should not think that because they are new, they are not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord is progressing in opening His word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even today we are seeing something more, that is, the matter of the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is strongly based upon 1 Corinthians 12:12, For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is the Christ Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>. The many members are one body, and so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is simply the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A JOYFUL NOISE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We believe in the Bible, the divine Word, and we believe every word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God incarnated to be a man, that He died on the cross for our sins and was literally resurrected from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is our Saviour and life today, and we are looking forward to His coming back, when we will all be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We believe in all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Who can say that we are heretical?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is it just because we are shouting?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Does this mean that to be silent is scriptural?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not believe so.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are many verses in the Bible about shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When all the captives returned to Jerusalem, and saw the foundation of the temple laid, they all shouted for joy Ezra 3:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Psalm 5:11 says, But let all those that put their trust in Thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because Thou defendest them: let them also that love Thy name be joyful in Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse says that we should ever shout for joy, not just once in a while.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It also says that if we love the Lord s name, we will be joyful in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are joyful, how could we be silent?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Psalm 47:1 says, O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some may argue that this is a kind of voice, not a noise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Psalm 100:1 says, Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible tells us to be noisy!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Seven times the Psalms tells us to make a joyful noise.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some will say that this is something of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we had better read Matthew 21:15-16, And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased, and said unto him, Hearest thou what these say?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The children were crying in the temple and shouting, Hosanna to the Son of David!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Certainly the chief priests and scribes thought this was out of place in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They were greatly displeased.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But Jesus declared that out of the mouth of babes and sucklings praise would come unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They were so quiet scripturally, but they never saw such a verse in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Preaching was only practiced in the sanctuary of the church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But God raised up John Wesley, who cared nothing for this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He preached and taught the Holy Word on the street corner.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In his meetings there was much shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even today, there are still the shouting Methodists.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Church history shows us that many human concepts were brought in to confine the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He told the seven churches in Revelation, I am the living One, and was dead; and, behold I am living forevermore Rev 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is living!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He can never be confined by any forms.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Of course, if we were to have a form of shouting, Jesus would leave that too.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why everything must be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>LESSONS LEARNED IN CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I was born and raised in formal Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I really know what Christianity is.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After I was saved, I was brought into an assembly of Christians to learn the good teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I received the teachings on prophecy and typology; but after seven and a half years, I discovered I had been killed by the teachings of dead letter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I repented and came into the matters of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After practicing the inner life for some time, I still felt weak, so I became involved with the Pentecostal things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I spoke in tongues for a considerable time and took the lead to help others to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then I stopped this peculiar kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By the Lord s mercy He planted me in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You can see that I passed through all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I was in formal Christianity, fundamental Christianity, the inner life, and the Pentecostal things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Through all this process, the Lord planted me in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now I have learned to enjoy the Lord as everything in my spirit by calling on the name of the Lord, the life-giving Spirit, and pray-reading the living Word, which is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>THE DIVINE SPIRIT MINGLING</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>WITH THE HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By all these lessons in the past, I have realized that it is altogether a matter of the divine Spirit mingling with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is why 2 Timothy 4:22 says, The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit, and 1 Corinthians 6:17 tells us, But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Zechariah speaks not only of the wonderful divine Spirit in his book Zech 4:6 , but also the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the whole universe, only three things are important: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The book of Zechariah speaks of the recovery of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But without the divine Spirit and the human spirit, God s building is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is why both of these spirits are mentioned in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God s building is possible, and God is doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This building is a corporate entity, the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How the Lord must open our eyes to see this!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The whole matter issues from the Triune God as the seven Spirits in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The book of Revelation is a harvest of the divine Spirit and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>John spoke of it first in his Gospel when he said that God is Spirit and that we must worship Him in spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now in the book of Revelation we see the sevenfold Spirit in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This book was written to the seven churches from the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne Rev 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To see all that the sevenfold, intensified Spirit is speaking to the churches, John had to be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In spirit he saw the churches with the Son of Man walking in the midst.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In spirit he saw the world under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In spirit he saw the great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In spirit he saw the Holy City, New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Everything was so clear because he was in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We will never understand what the Lord is speaking unless we also are in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When we are in spirit, the vision is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This book is the speaking of the Spirit to the churches Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Eventually, the Spirit and the Bride speak together as one Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is altogether a matter of the divine Spirit with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>May we all see this.</S>
