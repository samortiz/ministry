<p>Finally, verse 19 says, &ldquo;And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; We are not being filled with material things, scriptural knowledge, or the so-called spiritual gifts but unto all the fullness of God Himself. It is in this way that we are built up together, and it is in this way that we can realize the Body life. Otherwise, we can talk about the Body, but we still will not have its reality. The reality of the Body is this very indwelling Christ experienced by us in an inward way.</p>
<p>We all need a further time to kneel by ourselves in our rooms to pray over these verses until the heavenly vision is revealed into our spirit. This will revolutionize us, and our whole concept will be changed. What we need is not something outward or mere knowledge, gifts, signs, powers, and other such matters. What we absolutely need is the inner experience of the indwelling Christ. Ephesians 3 says that we are strengthened into the inner man, that Christ makes His home in our heart, and that we are filled (not covered or clothed) unto all the fullness of God, that is, the very being, essence, and element of God. The riches of Christ and His immeasurable dimensions include so much that we would need many days to explain even a little of our experience. It is through this inner experience of the indwelling Christ that we apprehend with all the saints the unlimited measure of Christ, and it is by this that we are built up.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Building Up of the Church by All the Saints through the Inner Experience<br />
of the Indwelling Christ</h2>
<p>Verse 1 of chapter 4 begins with, &ldquo;I beseech you therefore.&rdquo; <em>Therefore</em> indicates that what Paul is about to say is based on what was mentioned in chapter 3. Chapter 4 goes on to deal with the building up of the Body. As we have stressed previously, Christ the Head does not build His Body directly. Rather, He builds up the church through the gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Even these gifted persons, as the gifts given to the church, do not build the church directly. They perfect the saints as the members of the Body by ministering the unsearchable riches of Christ to them so that they may have the inner experience of the indwelling Christ. Christ makes His home in their hearts to occupy their whole being, and they grow up into Christ in all things. Then they are joined and knit together, and they receive something of the very indwelling Christ whom they have experienced to minister to one another. It is in this way that they are built up as the Body.</p>
<p>The key point concerning the building up of the church is the inner experience of the indwelling Christ. The gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers&mdash;do not minister gifts to people. Rather, they minister the unsearchable riches of Christ to the saints so that they may be perfected in life and in the experience of Christ in order to grow.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being Built Up<br />
Not by Knowledge nor the Gifts but by Life</h2>
<p>If you read Ephesians 3 and 4 again, kneeling before the Lord and praying, the Lord will give you a vision of these things. This is the way for the church to be built up and the way for each of us as members to be built up in the Body. It is not by knowledge or gifts. The more knowledge we have, the more divisions we will have, and the more gifts we have, the more fighting we will have. Rather, it is by the inner life, the inner experience of the indwelling Christ, that we are built up. We must pray, &ldquo;O Father, strengthen us into the inner man, that Your Son, Christ, may make His home in our heart, to take over and possess our whole being, that we may grow in Him and receive something from Him. Then by what we receive of the Head we will be able to minister to all the members of the Body, and we will be joined and knit together for the building up of the Body.&rdquo; It is in this way that we will have the reality of the Body.</p>
<p>This is not my own opinion or interpretation. Ephesians is the book that deals specifically with the church life, and the central portion of Ephesians is chapters 3 and 4. This portion tells us that our inner man must be strengthened, Christ is making His home in our heart, and we are being filled unto all the fullness of God. Then we grow up into Christ in all things and receive something from the Head which we minister to others in order to be built up together. It is in this way that we realize the Body life. This is what we need.</p>
<p>How subtle the enemy is today! He is challenging us on this point. Some say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to these people. They are a poor church. They don&rsquo;t have a nice church building. They only have some poor chairs, not proper pews.&rdquo; Truly, we are poor in material things. Moreover, some say that we are poor in knowledge, and others say we are poor in gifts. However, the church can never go on strongly and be built up properly by miraculous manifestations. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I am an experienced builder, and I have seen the proper way to build up the church. We can never build up a strong church by the gifts. The way to build up the church is by the experience and enjoyment of Christ as life for the Body.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
