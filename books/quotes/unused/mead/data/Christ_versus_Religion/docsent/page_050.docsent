   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to chapter 9 of John, where we find another sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have already passed through three sabbaths, and now we come to the fourth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In all of them the Lord Jesus did something to break them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus always acted deliberately and intentionally to break the sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was an excellent sabbath breaker.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must not think that it was just by accident that He performed these things on the sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No, He did it with a definite purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did it to purposely break the regulations of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A SABBATH REVIEW</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us review briefly the sabbaths through which we have already passed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is interesting that in the record of Matthew there are two sabbaths, and in the record of John there are another two sabbaths.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first sabbath was a case of hungry people: the Lord Jesus brought His disciples into the cornfield and gave them full freedom to do as they liked.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The cornfield was not the synagogue or the temple; it was a rather wild and uncultured place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Would you rather sit in good order in a cultured synagogue, or would you prefer to be in the cornfield, plucking the ears of corn, without keeping any regulations?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What kind of person would you prefer to be?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The cornfield was an eating place, a place of liberty from all religious regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second sabbath was a case of a withered member, which the Lord Jesus likened to a sheep fallen into a pit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The withered member was the fallen sheep without rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So the Lord broke the sabbath that the withered and fallen member might find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the second case the object of the Lord's concern was not in the cornfield, but in the pit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are withered, we are simply in the pit; we are bound and have no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But, hallelujah, the Lord Jesus has lifted us up!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus has healed us, and now we are out of the pit and dwelling at home.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is firstly a cornfield and then a home.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The third sabbath is the case of an impotent man lying in a religious porch, waiting for something to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus saw him and by His word imparted life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus has not only fed us and lifted us up, but imparted His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we not only have satisfaction and freedom, but we are made alive.</S>
