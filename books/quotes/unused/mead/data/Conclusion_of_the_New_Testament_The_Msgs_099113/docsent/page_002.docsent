   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE NINETY-NINE THE BELIEVERS THEIR STATUS 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these messages on the believers we shall cover the believers' status, designations, symbols, life, nature, past, present, and future.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We shall begin with the believers' status, and in this message we shall cover the believers' status before they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. BEFORE BEING SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before the believers were saved, they had a sixfold status.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were sinners, sons of disobedience, children of wrath, children of the Devil, enemies of God, and sons of Gehenna.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sinners</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before we were saved we were sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Matthew 9:13 the Lord Jesus says, "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1 Timothy 1:15 Paul declares, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." a. Having Sinned</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our status as sinners we all have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"All have sinned and come short of the glory of God" Rom 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word "all" refers to all human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Kings 8:46 says, "There is no man that sinneth not."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As those who have sinned, we have come short of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's glory is God Himself expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever God is expressed, His glory is seen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man was made by God in His image that man may express Him for His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But man has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead of expressing God, man expresses sin and his sinful self and thus is short of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We sinners were not only under the requirements of God's righteousness but also under the demand of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all have broken God's righteous law, and we all have come short of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, before we were saved we were under God's condemnation. b.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Constituted of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As sinners we not only sinned but were constituted of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A sinner is one who is constituted of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 5:19a says, "Through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result of Adam's disobedience, the many, including us, were not only made sinners but were constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>An element not created by God was injected into our being and constituted us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are sinners by constitution, not by accident, for sin has been wrought into us and constituted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, sin is not merely an outward deed; sin is an inward, subjective element in our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before we were saved we were typical sinners by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We were sinners not only because we had sinned, but because we were constituted of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We were constituted sinners in Adam long before we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, when we were born, we were born sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were born with a constitution of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From this we see that we do not become sinners after sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, we were sinners even before we sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All unbelievers, being constituted of sin, are sinners by birth. c.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Enslaved under Sin</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As those constituted of sin, we were enslaved under sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Romans 7:14b says, "I am fleshly, sold under sin."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The phrase "sold under sin" means sold to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sin is the buying master, and we were sold to him to be his slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In John 8:34 the Lord Jesus says, "Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A slave is always under bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Satan, the Devil, has brought all humankind under the bondage of sin by imparting himself into man as the sinful nature that compels man to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although we were not taught to sin, we were born as those enslaved to sin and could not keep from sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because we have a devilish nature, we are slaves of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is impossible for anyone to free himself from this slavery.</S>
