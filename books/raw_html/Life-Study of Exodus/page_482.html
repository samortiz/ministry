<h2 class="head1">THE PSALMIST&rsquo;S APPRECIATION<br />OF THE TWO ALTARS</h2><p>Because the two altars are connected, the psalmist speaks of them together: &ldquo;Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God&rdquo; (Psa. 84:3). Writing in a poetic way, the psalmist appreciates the two altars. This is especially interesting when we realize that in God&rsquo;s dwelling place there were other furnishings and utensils, such as the ark, the table, and the lampstand. But the two altars are foremost in the psalmist&rsquo;s appreciation.</p><p>The sparrow and the swallow signify us, human beings who are small, weak, and unworthy. The Lord Jesus said that two sparrows were sold for a penny (Matt. 10:29). Nevertheless, we who are as frail as sparrows can find a house at the Lord&rsquo;s altars. Furthermore, as swallows, we can lay our young at these altars.</p><p>Those who do not have the proper appreciation of Psalm 84 may wonder how sparrows and swallows could possibly make their nest at the Lord&rsquo;s altars. Those who view the psalm in this way may regard the altars as desolate and not taken care of by anyone. However, Psalm 84 is very sweet. It is filled with appreciation of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, in particular, of the two altars.</p><p>These altars signify Christ&rsquo;s death and His intercession. The offering altar is the altar of Christ&rsquo;s death, and the incense altar is the altar of Christ&rsquo;s intercession. I can testify that these two altars, joined together, have become very sweet to me in my experience. I am like a sparrow or a swallow nesting at the altars and laying my young ones there.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TWO ALTARS IN OUR EXPERIENCE</h2><p>In their experience many Christians have only one altar, the first altar, the offering altar in the outer court. This means that they have the cross, but they do not have the incense altar. In our experience we need both altars.</p><p>Now that we are studying the incense altar described in chapter 30 of Exodus, I am burdened to point out that we are not merely having a Bible study or simply teaching the Bible. All the points we are covering should be applied to our prayer life. Our prayer life must be in God, and it must be with God in us as our supply and satisfaction. If we are to have a proper prayer life, we must also offer Christ to God as incense. Furthermore, it is very important for us to see that this kind of prayer is linked to the crucified Christ. I would encourage you to bring all these matters to the Lord in prayer and ask Him to show you something further.</p><p>The revelation concerning the incense altar has helped me a great deal. Often it has served to govern my prayers. But sometimes, due to the environment, I too have prayed in a rather natural way.</p><p>May the Lord have mercy on us that we may see that the proper and genuine prayer life is in God and requires that God be in us; that it is one with the resurrected and ascended Christ as our incense to God; and that it is linked to the crucified Christ by the blood, the fire, and the sweet savor. If we have this kind of prayer, we shall be able to live a life that motivates God&rsquo;s move. This kind of prayer governs God&rsquo;s dispensation of grace and His administration of His authority. This means that the prayer offered at the incense altar governs the universe. This is a matter of great significance. May our eyes be opened to see it.</p>
