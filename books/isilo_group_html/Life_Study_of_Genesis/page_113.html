The Result</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) A Bride Gained&#151;Eve Gained by Adam</H2><P>The result of Adam's sleep in which his side was opened to release a rib was that he gained Eve as his complement to match him. This signifies that the result of Christ's death with His side pierced to release His divine life was that He obtained the church as His complement. Henceforth, God is no longer alone. Christ has gained a bride to match Him. Revelation 21&#151;22 unfolds that in eternity the New Jerusalem as the consummation of the church will be the bride of Christ for God's full complement to match Him eternally.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) One with Man&#151;Adam and Eve Becoming One Flesh</H2><P>Adam and Eve eventually became one flesh, one complete unit. This was a figure of God and man being joined as one. God's desire is to be one with man. He has reached this goal through Christ's death and resurrection which produced the church, representing the proper humanity to match Him as the husband. In this union humanity is one with divinity; this union will last for eternity. The coming New Jerusalem will be just the unity of God and man, a living, complete unit composed with divinity and humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) Living with Man&#151;Adam Living with Eve</H2><P>Adam and Eve, being one, lived together. This portrayed that God, the universal husband, will live with regenerated humanity forever. The universal marriage life of God and man is fully revealed in Revelation 21. In eternity, God in Christ will be the center, reality, and life of man's living, and man will live by God in Christ as life. Man will express God's glory and will exercise God's authority over the new earth. God and man, man and God will live together in a marriage life forever.</P><P>So, Genesis 1:1&#151;2:3 is a picture of God's purpose, and 2:4-25 is a portrait of the way to fulfill God's purpose. These two sections may be considered as a blueprint of an architectural plan. Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 may be considered as the building process, and Revelation 21 and 22 as a photograph of the finished building.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_112.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_114.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 113</div><br></body></html>
