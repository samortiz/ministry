   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>First Corinthians 12 unveils to us the manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After this, Paul shows us in chapter thirteen that love is the most excellent way to exercise the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we pay attention only to the outward gifts and do not have love, the gifts will be empty and without life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if we have love, and we add to it faith and hope, we have something that abides.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually, faith is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hope also is the Triune God, and love also is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our love is in the flesh, and it fluctuates constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are saved in the faith of Christ, and we receive Him into us also in the faith of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is also our hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should fellowship with Christ, abide in Him, eat, drink, and enjoy Him, and allow Him to do the transmitting work in us, communicating into us His divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then, if we need love, hope, or faith, Christ as our supply will spontaneously be expressed from us as love, hope, and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we come to 1 Corinthians 14, Paul begins by saying, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To pursue love is to pursue the growth in life so that we may develop the gifts in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the pursuing of love must be accompanied by an earnest desire for the most profitable gift, the gift of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, prophecy does not come merely from teaching, but from God being in man and man cooperating with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without God there is no prophesying, but neither can there be prophesying if there is only God without man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Prophesying is words spoken as a result of a cooperation and coordination between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is God's speaking in and through man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what the book of 1 Corinthians shows us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today Christ has come into us and has become our life and eternal portion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is our everything and has become our constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we are joined to Him as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By this, the capacity of His life is manifested in us and becomes the gifts in our meetings and service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nothing we do is done by ourselves; everything is done by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The result of everything we do is hope.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not do anything that is not in hope.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The result of everything we do is also love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In such a situation, we will spontaneously be able to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are the factors of our meetings and service as described in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we come to the meetings or to serve, we do not come alone or empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, we come with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is the content of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether we sing, pray, or speak, we are full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is also the content of our service.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever we do in the church must have Christ as its element.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we enjoy this all-inclusive Christ every day, He will become our inward supply in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He will become the dispensing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, He will be manifested in our meetings and service, in our gifts, and in all our activities.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the dispensing of God as our supply in our meetings and service.</S>
