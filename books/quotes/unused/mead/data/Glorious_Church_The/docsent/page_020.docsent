   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH IN GOD'S PLAN WITHOUT SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we read Ephesians 5:25, we find the same meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this passage we need to notice three points:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, Christ gave Himself up for us because we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 5, which speaks of Christ dying for sinners, is in reference to redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 5, however, does not deal with the problem of sinners but with the issue of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The context of Ephesians 5 is not that Christ came to die for us because we were sinners, but that He gave Himself up for us because we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, Christ gave Himself for us because He loves us, not because we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to 1 Corinthians 15, Christ died for our sins, but Ephesians 5 says that Christ loved the church and gave Himself for it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He gave Himself because of love, not because of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To die for sin is one thing, but to die for love is entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To die for sin deals with the problem of sin this is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Christ's giving Himself for us is a matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sin is not involved in Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This aspect of His death is related to love and has nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, Christ gave Himself for us in order to give Himself to us, without any question of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse may be translated, "Christ also loved the church and gave Himself to the church."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Adam imparted his bone to Eve; Christ has imparted Himself to us as well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have Him within us because He died; He has already entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because He died, we now have His very life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He Himself has been imparted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us consider this for a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is this not wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From God's point of view, the church has never sinned and has never been related to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is true that God knew that man fell and needed to be redeemed, but marvelously, along another line, He did not see sin at all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, there is a portion in us which has no need of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the portion which we have received from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It does not need to be redeemed because it transcends sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We obtained this portion, of course, after we were redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This portion is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Scriptures reveal how God has used many women to typify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis contains, in addition to the story of Eve, the story of Rebecca and Asenath.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rebecca's marriage to Isaac typifies the church being offered to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Asenath's marriage to Joseph and her bearing sons in Egypt typifies the church being chosen out of the world unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Exodus speaks of Zipporah being married to Moses in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This typifies the church in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Joshua speaks of Achsah, who after being married, asked for the upper springs and the lower springs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This typifies the church receiving the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ruth's marriage to Boaz typifies the redemption of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Abigail's marriage to David typifies the church enlisted as an army for warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Old Testament speaks of many women who typified the various aspects of the church; the church was chosen from the world, redeemed, taken through the wilderness, enlisted for warfare, given the inheritance, and offered to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All of these types in the Scriptures refer to the church, but of them all, the type in Genesis 2 is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no other type similar to it because Eve portrays the church as it really is in God's mind and the place it has in His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the other types occur after man's fall; only the type of Eve precedes the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the other types involve the matter of moral responsibility; this one alone is free of it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Eve that God made came out of Adam, not out of a redeemed sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She was made before sin occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In like manner, the church comes out of Christ; it is not a matter of sinners receiving grace and being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eve came out of Adam and was wholly for Adam; even so, the church comes out of Christ and is wholly for Christ.</S>
