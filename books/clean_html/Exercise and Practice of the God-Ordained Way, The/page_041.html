<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWELVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE PRACTICAL PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 15:8, 16</h1><p>In this message we will fellowship more concerning the gospel of Christ. This kind of fellowship should be of help to us in learning how to preach the gospel to others. In visiting with people, we should be normal, living, and lovely to them. The ones we visit should be inspired and moved by our speaking. Some preach the gospel as though they were reading a newspaper clipping to someone. The result of this kind of preaching is that there is no impact.<p>Others lose the listener by providing too much explanation in their preaching. This creates the opportunity for side issues to come in. If we are asked a question, we should restrict our answer to the point at hand, thus leaving no side issue to be raised by the person. Do not think that it is better to have a large amount of speaking. This may cause the impact to be lost. It is better to speak a few words that are directly to the point to bring the person to the proper destination. In this way we are like ushers who direct people to their seats in an auditorium. We must learn to purify our speaking and avoid speaking according to our natural custom.<h2 class=head1>USING PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS</h2><p>My main concern is that many of the saints go out diligently and faithfully to talk to people, but most of the speaking is doctrinal in nature. We all need training in order to overcome our doctrinal nature. The person we are visiting may ask us to explain to him who God is. We must learn not to answer such a question with doctrines but with some kind of practical illustration. We may tell him that in the whole universe there must be a sovereign One. God is this sovereign One. We have to learn to always hit the point and avoid side issues.<p>I have practiced gospel preaching for many years. I have discovered that many sinners like to ask a lot of questions which lead into side issues, thus taking you away from the main point. It is best not to follow their questions. You must consider the best way to answer so that the side issues are kept closed. This requires learning. If you are presented with a question which you cannot answer so well right away, you should still do your best to give an answer. However, you should learn not to answer too quickly.<p>To one who asks who God is, you may say, “This is the biggest question in the universe. The philosophers and religious leaders have always considered this problem. One thing that is clear to all of them is that there must be someone in the universe who is sovereign.” This leads the person to a direct point. Then point out that this sovereign One is called God. He is not Buddha. He is not an idol. He is just God. God is unique. God is one and only one. He is the One who created the entire universe, including man. At this time you can direct him to the point which you want to reach. This will keep him from going astray. You have to be trained, but you also have to consider the questions. Ask yourself how to answer who God is. This kind of thinking and considering will cause you to learn some secrets.<p>Theology alone does not work. When you talk to people, the greatest impact will be from practical speaking. If you are not practical in your speaking, you will create more questions in the ones you contact. You must answer in a very practical way. This is why you have to learn. Do not just learn in a doctrinal way in order to go out to give lectures to people. Lectures have no impact. Just talk in a practical way. Of course, your talk must be based upon Biblical knowledge. But the way you use your knowledge of the Bible is the key. You must learn to convert your doctrinal talking into practical talking. Do not talk like a Bible teacher or theologian but in a practical way, touching people’s daily life.
