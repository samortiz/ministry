   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another great recovery, which we should not neglect, is the recovery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In England C. H. Spurgeon was called the king of preachers, and in America D. L. Moody was called the king of evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The two were famous preachers of the gospel in the nineteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They brought many people to salvation, and their gospel influenced many people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Just prior to the beginning of the twentieth century, many of the missionaries who went to China were saved through the preaching of Moody and Spurgeon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Very few people have spread the gospel as much as these two men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The move to take the gospel abroad came next.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Foreign missions peaked at the end of the nineteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The gospel went out to the entire globe, following developments in world politics, military affairs, commerce, and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Western missionaries preached the gospel all over the world in Africa, South America, China, Japan, India, and even in the remote islands of the Pacific Ocean; furthermore, a great deal of money followed these missionaries from Europe and America to the places to which they were sent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This gospel work was prevailing at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, God was working in His church, and on the other hand, the environment was ready.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These things were under God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The gospel in Europe and America was a great recovery, as was the foreign missionary work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, in the foreign missionary work there were both good things and complicated things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There were all kinds of people with all kinds of backgrounds.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, the China Inland Mission was good, but not all of its missionaries were very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I was serving the Lord in China and had some knowledge of Him, I was able to observe some missionaries from the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I discovered certain situations that were not acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some of the missionaries did things in the way of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, one of them, who taught theology and wrote a Greek dictionary for the New Testament, eventually became his country s ambassador to China.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was unquestionably good for diplomatic relations, but was spiritually very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is evidence of the confusion and corruption among the missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There were even non-believers who went out preaching as missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One of my history teachers was an atheist, but he also stood in the pulpit to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the situation was very confused.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The spread of the gospel abroad was a great recovery, but within that recovery there were many corrupt situations that cause one s heart to ache.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many good universities in China were founded by mission boards, such as Yenching University in Peking, Huchiang University in Shanghai, and Tungwu University in Soochow, Kiangsu Province.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition, the missions founded many hospitals; however, this proves that their work was quite complicated and transmuted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result of these recoveries related to the gospel, there were churches in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, when good things come, bad things follow; when genuine things come, false things follow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In China the people, the work, and the truths were both good and bad, a mixture of a little of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we still praise the Lord that because of these recoveries, the gospel was preached in our homeland, producing the church throughout China and resulting in our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we were to make a list of every recovery from justification by faith up until the present, I believe we would find that almost all the truths in the Bible have been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although they are not all complete, they are still substantially recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, while we cannot say that everything has been recovered, we can say that almost everything has been recovered.</S>
