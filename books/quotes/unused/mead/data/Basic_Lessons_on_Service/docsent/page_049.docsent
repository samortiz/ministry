   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the previous lesson we saw the portions of the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this lesson we want to begin to fellowship about the enjoyment of the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this lesson we need to read all of Leviticus 3.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I feel that we need to help the saints to read this chapter very carefully, and we need to ask them to pay their full attention to two things: the blood and the fat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that the net above the liver is also God's portion from the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The net is a part of the fat.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition to this, there are the two kidneys and the fat tail.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, the fat tail is additional fat Lev 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>E. The Enjoyment of the Peace Offering 1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's Portion a. The Blood</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this lesson we want to cover God's portion of the enjoyment of the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's portion firstly is the blood Lev 3:2, 8, 13, 17; 7:26-27, 33 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fat is for God, and the blood is also for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Men were not allowed to eat the fat or to drink the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Leviticus 3:17 says, "It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations wherever you dwell, that you shall not eat any fat or any blood."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse strongly charges that no fat or blood should be taken by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1 To Satisfy His Righteous Requirements</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The blood satisfies God's righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God needs the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God desires to have fellowship with His chosen people, but He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His righteous requirements will not allow Him to have fellowship with His chosen people as long as they have sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the blood is required.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may say that our sin or our sins require the blood, but actually, it is not so accurate to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The most we can say is that our sin or our sins need the blood to solve their problem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the requirements are not on our side; the requirements are on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's righteous requirements need the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So the blood firstly satisfies God's righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2 To Maintain His Holy Position</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Righteousness is a condition, whereas holiness is a position.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The blood is needed to satisfy God's righteousness, and it is also needed to maintain God's holiness, God's holy position.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If God came to fellowship with us sinners without the blood, this would overthrow His position.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the holy God, and His position is altogether holy, separated from anything common.</S>
