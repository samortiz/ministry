   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We ourselves need to labor directly to bring one or two into the church life yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This should be a goal in our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We love the church, but we may not have brought one person into the church in the past five years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must have a definite beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must practice contacting people to bring definite fruit into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also need to practice the church life in group meetings and in larger prophesying meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is really needed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we need the adequate number as a base for our practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The elders need to work two to three hours in the gospel every week to bring one or two remaining fruit into the church within a year.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the elders do this, others will rise up to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not give any announcement about this or promote it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have been doing this for years, with little result.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Promotion does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to labor ourselves to build up a living example.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is altogether up to our decision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Would we still remain in the natural way, or would we turn to this way, a way full of the need for learning?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A working brother's job may occupy him to the uttermost, but he should still endeavor to save some time every week for definite laboring in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many of us have been busy working for years with little result.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must change our way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must have a plan for reaching people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should make a list of all our acquaintances and study their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we can work on them according to our study.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the way to gain the proper persons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not leave our bearing of fruit to fortune.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not a matter of fortune but a matter of labor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all have acquaintances for whom we can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to consider them and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to study their situation and decide when the best time would be for us to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Farmers do not labor in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They study the situation of their land, their crops, and the weather, and they labor accordingly so that they can reap a proper harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to be the same way in our labor to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must have a plan and a schedule to labor on people two to three hours every week.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to learn how to gain people.</S>
