   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Salvation, the Power, the Kingdom of Our God, and the Authority of Christ Having Come</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Revelation 12:5 there is the birth of the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The man-child signifies the overcomers who have the authority to rule over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This man-child will be raptured to the throne of God in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the man-child is raptured to the throne, there will be a great battle in the heavens against Satan, and Satan will be cast down to the earth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today the enemy, Satan, is still in the heavens, but once the overcomers arrive there, he will have no place but will be cast down.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once he has been cast down, a loud voice will declare, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ v. 10 . Here Christ is spoken of as His Christ, the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Again this implies the trinity of the Godhead, for Christ is God Himself Rom 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1 Our Prayer for the Coming of the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord s desire today is to establish His kingdom in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be a Christian is not merely a matter of being holy and victorious; it is a matter of submitting to the authority of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be a Christian is not only a matter of grace, enjoyment, life, and power; it is also a matter of allowing Christ to have the right to govern us, constitute us His kingdom, set up His throne, and carry out His will in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When there is a group of people in the church who are willing to allow Christ s authority to flow among them, this will bring Christ s kingdom to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When there is a group of overcomers in the church, these overcomers will bring the authority of heaven, the kingdom of God, to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time the church will be victorious, and the enemy will be powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The overcoming believers fight against Satan to usher in God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord taught us to pray for the coming of the kingdom Matt 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May the Lord grant us mercy and show us that His prayer is for the unlimited spread of the kingdom of God on the earth and in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course, in order to carry out such a plan of God, there is the need for God s people to pray sufficiently.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The true prayers of God s people are for His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may pray for numerous things, but unless the ultimate purpose is for God s kingdom, those prayers are of no value before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We admit that in the Lord s prayer there is the matter of dealing with sins and the matter of the daily living, but its beginning and ending are entirely for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the beginning it says, Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth v. 10 . At the end it says, For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever v. 13 . Therefore, this prayer shows us that He wants our prayer to be wholly for God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The situation in Revelation 12 depicts the true prayers of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There we see the woman bringing forth a man-child v. 5 . The woman signifies the totality of the redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The man-child signifies the stronger part of the redeemed people, that is, the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to realize that the woman and the man-child whom she brought forth have prayed v. 2 . Their voices have reached God; hence, following the rapture of the man-child there is war in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consequently, God s enemy is cast out from heaven to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then there is a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ v. 10 . Hence, once God s people utter the real prayers, the result is always the ushering in of God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other hand, without the prayers of God s people, there is no way for God s kingdom to come.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The coming of the kingdom is absolutely related to our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The examples in the Old Testament also confirm this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the children of Israel were in captivity, Jerusalem was destroyed, the temple was burned, and the nation of Israel was in complete collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that time, God raised up several men of prayer in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Daniel and three of his friends were competent in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their prayers brought in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God s kingdom had come to the earth through David, but after Solomon s time it was defeated again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Babylon Daniel was praying precisely for this matter so that God s kingdom might be brought back once more to the earth Dan 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was completely due to Daniel s prayer that God was able to build the temple, restore Jerusalem, and have the dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we must be clear that whether or not God s kingdom can come and whether or not He can rule on earth all depend on whether or not God s people will pray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The ultimate purpose of prayer is for bringing in God s kingdom.</S>
