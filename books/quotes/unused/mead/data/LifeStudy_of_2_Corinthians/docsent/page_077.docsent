   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPRESSION OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in us because we walk according to the Spirit, then we have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Righteousness, as we pointed out in the previous message, signifies the expression of God, His image.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we have righteousness, we have the expression of the God we serve and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because we have this expression as the spontaneous righteousness we live out by the Spirit of life, others can be convinced and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, those who oppose us may eventually be convinced by seeing the expression of God lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Romans 8:4 Paul speaks of the righteous requirement of the law, and in verse 29 he speaks of the image of God s Son: Because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we put this verse together with verses 2 and 4, we have the Spirit, righteousness, and the image.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Day by day, we need to walk according to the Spirit of life so that we may fulfill the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is equal to being conformed to the image of God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may wonder how we can be conformed to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way to be conformed to His image is to walk according to the Spirit of life so that the righteous requirements of the law may be fulfilled in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we shall have righteousness, and this righteousness is the very image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the Spirit produces righteousness, and righteousness is the image.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 14:17 says, For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this verse Paul gives us another aspect of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Romans 8 we have righteousness related to the Spirit of life and issuing in the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in Romans 14:17 righteousness is related to the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this chapter the kingdom of God denotes the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The meetings of the church are an exhibition of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the church life we have a condition and a situation that shows others what the kingdom of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church life is the kingdom of God, and the kingdom of God is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul s word in Romans 14:17 corresponds to what is written in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to Psalm 89:14, righteousness is the foundation of God s throne.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse can also be translated to say that righteousness is the establishment of God s throne.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s throne is established with righteousness as the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The book of Isaiah also has much to say about righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, Isaiah 32:1 says, Behold, a King shall reign in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here righteousness is again related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Where God s righteousness is, there His kingdom is also.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, Hebrews 1:8 and 9 say, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These verses are a quotation from Psalm 45.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Old Testament righteousness is often synonymous with the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, righteousness is related to government, administration, regulation, and rule.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Righteousness means that things are set up and maintained in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Where there is righteousness, everything is headed up in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Righteousness first issues in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then righteousness establishes the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Romans 8 we have righteousness and God s image, and in Romans 14 we have righteousness and God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Both the image and the kingdom are based on righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us now apply this aspect of righteousness to our family life and our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When a husband and wife are not happy with each other and the situation at home is not pleasant, there is no righteousness, no image of the Son, in their family life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, the kingdom of God is not present, for God s kingdom is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Others observing the situation will not receive any impression of the image of Christ, the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, suppose a brother and his wife live in the Spirit and walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They will be happy, and their children will be happy also.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What a glorious family life that would be!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Others will be able to see the image of God and realize that the kingdom of God is present in that family.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is righteousness in the family life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose in a particular church the saints are murmuring, criticizing, and gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, suppose that in the meetings there is disorder.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a church is in such a condition, there is no expression of God and no kingdom of God there.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But suppose that instead of murmuring, criticizing, or gossiping, there are forbearance, praise, calling on the Lord, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moreover, suppose the meetings are living, in good order, and rich in function.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Surely in such a church we can see the kingdom of God full of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everything there is orderly and peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The goal of the new covenant ministry is to minister the all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God into others to be their supply.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Simultaneously, this ministry dispenses Christ into the believers as their righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then as the believers live and walk according to the Spirit, they will be in a condition that expresses God and that gives an impression of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, they will actually be the kingdom of God established in righteousness, set in order, and properly headed up.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They will also have peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the result of the new covenant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By contrast, the result of today s different ministries is that there are differences of opinion, division, and disorder.</S>
