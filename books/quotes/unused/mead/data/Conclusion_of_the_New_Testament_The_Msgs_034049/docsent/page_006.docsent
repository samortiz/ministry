   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A Great Light Springing Up</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to the People Sitting in Darkness</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and the Shadow of Death</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaiah 9:2 prophesies, The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This prophecy is fulfilled in Matthew 4:15 and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Christ came to people, He came as a great light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Peter, Andrew, James, and John did not realize that they were in darkness as they were working by the Sea of Galilee to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They did not know that they were in the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As Peter and Andrew were casting their nets into the sea, Christ as the great light shined upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ s ministry did not begin with earthly power it began with heavenly light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This light is Christ Himself as the light of life, shining in the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lord began His ministry as light, He made no display of power or authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, He walked by the seashore as a common person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when He came to those four disciples by the Sea of Galilee, He shined upon them with a great light, shining in the darkness and in the region of the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that juncture, Peter, Andrew, James, and John were enlightened, attracted, and captured.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Immediately they forsook their jobs and followed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Matthew 4 there is no record, as in Luke 5, of any miracle being done by the Lord when Peter was called.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Matthew 4 there is the great light that attracted the first disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This attraction did not come from what the Lord Jesus did; it came from what He was.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was a great light with the power to attract people and capture them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way He attracted and captured the first four disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter, Andrew, James, and John were attracted and captured at the seashore not by seeing what the Lord did, but by realizing what the Lord was.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because they had been attracted and captured, they became faithful followers of the Lord Jesus unto the end.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>16.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The One Whose Zeal for</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s House Devoured Him</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Psalm 69:9a says, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This word was fulfilled at the time Christ cleansed the temple, the house of God John 2:12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the Lord cleansed the temple, His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of Your house shall devour Me John 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Within the Lord Jesus there was a zeal for the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This zeal devoured Him, ate Him up, consumed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was absolutely for the Father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father s house was His heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Lord saw the corrupted situation in the temple, He could not tolerate it, but cleansed it, even with a whip.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was driven by zeal for His Father s house to drive all the defilement out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His heart was pure for the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He could not bear to see that the temple, His Father s house, was contaminated by the things of man s greed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, in His zeal, He cleansed the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>17.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A Prophet Raised Up by God</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is also the Prophet raised up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The prophecy concerning this is in Deuteronomy 18:15, 18-19, and the fulfillment is in John 1:45 and Acts 3:22-23.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ was not only the One who proclaimed God s jubilee, and He was not merely a light shining in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, He was not only the One whose zeal for God s house devoured Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord was also a Prophet to speak forth God and to predict many things concerning God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some of Christ s speaking recorded in the Gospels is the speaking forth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some of His speaking in the Gospels includes predictions concerning God s economy, especially concerning the fulfillment of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In His ministry Christ surely was a great Prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>18.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Jehovah s Servant, Not Striving nor Crying Out,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not Breaking a Bruised Reed nor</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Quenching the Smoking Flax</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Isaiah 42:1-3 prophesies that in His ministry, His service, Christ would be Jehovah s Servant, not striving nor crying out, not breaking a bruised reed nor quenching the smoking flax.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This prophecy is fulfilled in Matthew 12:17-21.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Matthew 12:19 says of Christ, He shall not strive nor cry out, nor shall anyone hear His voice in the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In His ministry the Lord did not strive with others, and He did not promote Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He did not seek to make Himself known to people on the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He had no fame, and He made no name for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In a sense He was very hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the Lord Jesus was living on earth, He never made Himself great.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rather, He always kept Himself small.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should be hidden and concealed all the time as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we would enjoy Christ, we should remain small, concealed, and hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Matthew 12:20 goes on to say, in fulfillment of Isaiah 42:3, A bruised reed He shall not break, and smoking flax He shall not quench.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Not only did Christ make no noise in the streets; He did not break a bruised reed nor quench a smoking flax.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This indicates that He was full of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Jews often made flutes of reeds.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When a reed was bruised and no longer useful as a musical instrument, they broke it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They also made torches of flax to burn with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The oil ran out, the flax smoked, and they quenched it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some of the Lord s people are like a bruised reed that cannot give a musical sound; others are like smoking flax that cannot give a shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Yet the Lord will not break the bruised ones who cannot give a musical sound, nor quench the ones like dimly burning flax that cannot give a shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>19.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A Man of Sorrows Despised</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>and Rejected of Men</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christ was also a man of sorrows despised and rejected of men Isa 53:3; Psa 22:6-7; Luke 22:28; 23:11; Matt 27:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He was not a man of enjoyment, happiness, or blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As we consider Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, Luke 22, and Matthew 27, we see a portrait of Christ as a despised man of sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>20.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The One Willing to Be Humiliated</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Isaiah 50:6 prophesies of Christ as the One willing to be humiliated: I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This word is fulfilled in Matthew 26:67: They spit in His face and beat Him with their fists, and they slapped Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>21.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The One upon Whom Fell</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>the Reproaches of Those Who Reproached God</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>According to Psalm 69:9b, the reproaches of those who reproached God would fall upon Christ: The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Christ suffered not only for us but even for God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He suffered as God s Substitute, for the reproaches of those who reproached God fell upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hence, Christ was not only our Substitute bearing our problems, but was also God s Substitute bearing God s problems.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In Romans 15:3 Paul quotes the prophecy in Psalm 69:9b in order to encourage the saints to bear the problems of others just as Christ bore God s problems.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you consider the matters we have covered thus far concerning the person of Christ in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies, you will see a portrait of who Christ is and what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>All these matters are related to Christ s coming to dispense God into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Every aspect of Christ s person prophesied in the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New is for this purpose.</S>
