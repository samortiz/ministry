   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Producing a Corporate Seed as the Issue</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>of the Travail of His Soul, Whom He Saw</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>in His Resurrection and Was Satisfied</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through His life-releasing death and with His life-imparting resurrection, Christ produced a corporate seed as the issue of the travail of His soul, whom He saw in His resurrection and was satisfied Isa 53:10c-11b .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isaiah 53:10b says, "When He makes Himself an offering for sin, He will see a seed."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we mentioned previously, Christ's making Himself an offering for sin is related to His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is the "cause," and the "effect" is His seeing a seed in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here seed is singular, indicating that the seed is a corporate seed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This corporate seed implies all the many grains, all the members of Christ's Body, all Christ's brothers, and all the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The great "delivery" of Christ's resurrection still has not ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This delivery is continuing; it has produced millions of saints, and it is still producing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We, the gospel preachers, are the midwives.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we go out to contact sinners, we help to speed up the delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All those brought forth through the gospel are the components of this corporate seed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was accomplished through Christ's life-increasing and life-releasing death with His life-imparting resurrection, which produced a corporate seed as the issue of the travail of His soul, whom He saw in His resurrection and was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I believe that, even today, when the Lord Jesus looks at us, He is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are a part of the seed; we are a part of the issue, the outcome, of His travail.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To Be His Continuation</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>for the Extension of His Days</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This seed is Christ's continuation for the extension of His days Rev 1:18a .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because Christ continues to live by living in us, we are the extension of His days.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For the Pleasure of Jehovah,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Which Will Prosper in His Hand</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is for the pleasure of Jehovah Eph 1:5, 9; Phil 2:13 , which will prosper in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the fulfillment of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians 1:5 and 9 are two verses that mention God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's economy comes out of God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's dispensing is to fulfill God's good pleasure, which is to produce many sons to be the components of the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the whole universe nothing but the church could be God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our gospel preaching, merely to save souls is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to realize that our preaching of the gospel is to produce something to be God's pleasure, something to make God happy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When one soul is saved, thousands of angels in heaven rejoice Luke 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The angels are so happy because this is God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Isaiah 53:10c says that the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in the resurrected Christ's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ's hand today is still moving, working, and operating to produce more and more believers for God's good pleasure.</S>
