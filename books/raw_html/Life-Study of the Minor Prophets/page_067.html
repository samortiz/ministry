<h2 class="head1">II. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S JUDGMENT</h2>
<p>Let us now go on to consider the matter of Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. On Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah Cutting Off the Wicked</h2>
<p>In His judgment on Israel, Jehovah will cut off man, beast, birds, fish, stumbling blocks, the wicked, the remnant of Baal, the idol worshippers, the idol priests with the priests, the worshippers of the host of heaven, the worshippers of Malcam, and those who have been turned back from going after Jehovah (1:2-6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah Preparing Jerusalem<br />
with Its Princes</h2>
<p>In His judgment on Israel, Jehovah would also prepare Jerusalem with its princes, the sons of the king, all who wore the clothing of foreigners, and all those who did violence and deceit, as His sacrifice, and He would call the Chaldeans, whom He had sanctified, to come and eat His sacrifice by plundering the wealth of Jerusalem and desolating the houses and vineyards in Jerusalem (vv. 7-13). God had prepared His sinful elect as His sacrifice to offer to the invading army of the Chaldeans (Ezek. 39:19-20; Jer. 25:9). The Chaldean army, as the cutting, swarming, licking, and consuming locusts, would destroy Israel, and this destruction would be their eating of the sacrifice.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Great Day of Jehovah<br />
Being Near</h2>
<p>In verses 14 through 18 the prophet said that the great day of Jehovah was near. This would be a day of overflowing wrath, a day of trouble and distress, and a day of waste and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and deep darkness, and a day of trumpet and alarm against the fortified cities and the high battlements. Jehovah would bring distress upon the people so that they would walk about like the blind. Their blood would be poured out like the dust, and their bowels like dung. Neither their silver nor their gold would be able to deliver them. The whole land would be devoured by the fire of Jehovah&rsquo;s wrath and jealousy, for He would make an end, a sudden destruction, of all the inhabitants of the land.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Prophet&rsquo;s Admonition<br />
to the Shameless People of Israel</h2>
<p>In 2:1-3 we have the prophet&rsquo;s admonition to the shameless people of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Admonishing Them to Gather Themselves Together<br />
to Repent to Jehovah</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Gather yourselves together, yes, gather, / O nation that has no shame, / Before the decree has effect, / (The day passes like chaff) / Before there comes upon you / The burning anger of Jehovah, / Before there comes upon you / The day of Jehovah&rsquo;s anger&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). Here the prophet said that before the burning anger of Jehovah came upon them, they should gather themselves together to repent to Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Admonishing Them to Seek<br />
Jehovah, Righteousness, and Meekness</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Seek Jehovah, / All you meek of the earth, / Who have performed His judgments. / Seek righteousness; / Seek meekness; / Perhaps you will be hidden / In the day of Jehovah&rsquo;s anger&rdquo; (v. 3). Here the prophet admonished them to seek Jehovah, to seek righteousness, and to seek meekness so that they would be hidden in the day of Jehovah&rsquo;s anger.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Degradation of Jerusalem<br />
at the Prophet&rsquo;s Time</h2>
<p>In 3:1-7 the prophet speaks concerning the degradation of Jerusalem at his time. This degradation was the cause of God&rsquo;s coming in to judge, correct, and chastise them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. On the Nations</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on the nations would include His judgment on the Philistines (2:4-7), on Moab and Ammon (vv. 8-11), on the Cushites (v. 12), on Assyria (vv. 13-15), and on all the nations (3:8).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2>
<p>In 3:9-20 we have a word concerning Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation to the Gentiles and to Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. To The Gentiles</h2>
<p>In His salvation to the Gentiles, Jehovah, in the time of restoration, will &ldquo;change the language of the peoples / Into a pure language&rdquo; (v. 9). To change a people&rsquo;s language is to change their culture because culture is wrapped up with language. The original language of any people is dirty and impure. But in His salvation God will change the language of the peoples into a pure language. When a person&rsquo;s language has become pure, this indicates that a person has been thoroughly saved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. To Israel</h2>
<p>In verses 10 through 20 the prophet speaks regarding Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation to Israel. His salvation to Israel is for Christ to be the King of Israel. In these verses first we see Jehovah&rsquo;s deliverance (vv. 10-13, 15-20) and then Israel&rsquo;s singing and rejoicing (v. 14).</p>
