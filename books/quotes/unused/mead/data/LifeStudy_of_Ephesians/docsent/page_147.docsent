   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE LIVING BY BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the matter of living by being filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is covered by Paul in 5:15-21.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. THE FIFTH ITEM</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>OF THE WALK WORTHY OF GOD S CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To live by being filled in spirit is the fifth item of a walk worthy of God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first four aspects of such a worthy walk are the keeping of the oneness, the growing up into the Head, the learning of Christ, and the living in love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In chapter four Paul speaks of keeping the oneness, of growing up into the Head, and of learning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter five he speaks of living in love and in light and of living by being filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, in chapter five there are three crucial words: love, light, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Love and light are covered in the first fourteen verses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The next section of this chapter deals with the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be filled in spirit v. 18 is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, the human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our spirit should not be empty, but should be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the items in 5:18 6:9 are related to the one matter of being filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many readers of this chapter pay attention to such details as wives submitting to their own husbands or husbands loving their wives, but they fail to see the source of all these virtues, that is, being filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we are filled in our spirit with Christ unto all the fullness of God, then wives will be subject to their husbands, husbands will love their wives, parents will care for their children, slaves will obey their masters, and masters will treat their slaves in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All of these things are the issue of being filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those from a Pentecostal or charismatic background may regard the spirit in verse 18 as the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They may interpret Paul s word to mean that we should be filled with the Holy Spirit and speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But according to the Greek text, Paul here is not saying that we should be filled with the Spirit, but that we should be filled in our spirit, that is, in our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our spirit may be empty and flat, like a flat tire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If our spirit is flat, it needs to be filled with pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to go to the heavenly filling station and get our spirit filled with pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way we shall be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to chapter three, we are to be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If our spirit is filled with the riches of Christ, we shall have no problems in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have pointed out that living by being filled in spirit is the fifth aspect of a walk worthy of God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first aspect is the keeping of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is for the Body life, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second aspect is the growing up into Christ the Head in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Following this, we learn Christ by being placed into the mold, the standard of a living according to the truth in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We Christians have a high standard with an uplifted principle to govern our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To learn Christ is to take Him as the standard and to take His life as the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fourthly, a life worthy of God s calling is a life in love and in light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must live not only according to truth and by grace, but also in light and in love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to be those who live in intimacy with God and walk in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our daily life must be altogether according to God s heart and in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have these four aspects of a worthy walk, we shall spontaneously be filled in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These five items are arranged in a marvelous sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Firstly we keep the oneness, and then we grow in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After this, we learn Christ and live in love and in light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we are spontaneously filled in our spirit with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Out of this inner filling will come submission, love, obedience, care, and all the other attributes of a proper Christian life, church life, family life, and community life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the fifth aspect of a walk worthy of God s calling is the issue of the first four aspects; that is, it is the issue of keeping the oneness, growing in Christ, learning Christ, and living in love and in light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What a life we have when we demonstrate these five aspects of a worthy walk!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are filled inwardly unto the fullness of God, there will be no problems at home, in the church, or in the community.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the crucial point in this message.</S>
