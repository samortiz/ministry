<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>TO BE SAVED BY REIGNING IN LIFE AND BY THE DISPOSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION OF THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:17; 8:2, 5b, 4</h1><h2 class=head1>AN OPENING WORD</h2><p>The full salvation of God to us is revealed in the book of Romans in two sections. The first section is God’s redemption through the death of Christ, and the second is God’s saving in the life of Christ. Hence, 5:10 says, “If, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.” The main significance of what is covered in Romans chapters one through four is the redemption of Christ (including reconciliation) in God’s full salvation, and the main significance of what is covered in Romans chapters five through sixteen is the saving of Christ in God’s full salvation. In this book we will see only the main significance of the second section of Romans, that is, how Christ saves us in His divine life.<h2 class=head1>SAVED BY REIGNING IN LIFE</h2><p>Many readers of the book of Romans appreciate chapter five because it contains many wonderful matters, such as justification, peace, joy, boasting, and glory (vv. 1-5). But few have paid attention to the matter of reigning in life in verse 17. Romans 5:17 says, “For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.” In this verse the abundance of two things is mentioned: the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness. Grace has been given, and out of the abundance of grace, the gift of righteousness has also been given. The righteousness of God has been given to us as a gift. This gift of righteousness is one of the highest gifts that God gives to us in the whole universe. Many of us may have realized that God has given us His Son, His eternal life, and the Holy Spirit as the precious gifts. But very few of us may have realized that God has also given us His righteousness as a crucial gift.<p>Paul’s presentation of the righteousness of God in the book of Romans is very strong, clear, and irrefutable. He presents the righteousness of God as the base of our faith and shows that this righteousness of God is based upon God Himself. This righteousness of God is the foundation of God’s salvation in the book of Romans.<p>God’s salvation in the book of Romans is mainly a matter in life. But His salvation has a base. In the Gospel of John, the base of God’s salvation is love (3:16). In the book of Ephesians, the base of God’s salvation is grace (2:5, 8). In Romans God’s love (5:5) and grace (5:2, 15, 17, 20, 21) are mentioned, but the base of His salvation in Romans is righteousness (1:17). The base of righteousness is God Himself. Without God, there is no righteousness. God Himself is the base of His righteousness, and His righteousness is the base of His salvation. His salvation has the solid foundation of His righteousness, and upon this foundation of righteousness, we are saved. Only God’s righteousness, not man’s righteousness, including the Jew’s righteousness, can be counted on.<p>God’s righteousness is the very foundation of His throne (Psa. 89:14; 97:2, NASB). God’s throne is standing on His righteousness. If you were to take away the righteousness of God, everything in the whole universe would collapse. Concerning His righteousness, God is tested, examined, and judged (Rom. 3:4). In this testing, examination, and judgment, He has already won the victory, and no one is able to defy God in His righteousness.<p>Due to the problem of man’s fall, the redemption of Christ was needed. Therefore, after presenting the fact of man’s fall (Rom. 1:21—3:20), Paul presents Christ’s redemption (Rom. 3:21-26). Christ came as our Redeemer in order to accomplish redemption. God can justify us based upon Christ’s redemption (v. 24) because all of His righteous requirements have been fulfilled by Christ’s death on the cross. Because of Christ’s redemption, He has a strong base according to His righteousness to justify us and to declare that we are approved by Him. His justification is not merely a matter of love; it is a matter of righteousness. The justification God has given us is based upon the fulfillment of His righteous requirements by Christ’s all-inclusive death. Hence, God’s justifying us is a matter of His righteousness, and His righteousness never changes.<p>God’s gift of His righteousness matches His grace. First, God’s grace is given; then out of God’s grace, there is God’s gift. This gift is the righteousness of God. Because we have received the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness, we can reign in life. After we have been justified, we should reign in life.<p>The crown of our enjoyment of all the items in chapter five is reigning in life. We are kings enjoying the kingship, but our kingship is not one of authority or power. Our enjoyment of the kingship is in life. Life should be the crown of our enjoyment of God’s salvation. Our enjoyment of God’s salvation should come up to the standard that we are kings reigning in life.<p>We are saved in the divine life of Christ, by reigning in the divine life, from all kinds of insubordination. To be saved in life causes us to reign as kings. According to Romans 5:17, those who receive the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness, those who are justified, shall reign in life. A justified person should reign because he has the divine life, a kingly life, with which to reign. Without the kingly life, no one can reign. When we were redeemed by Christ, forgiven of our sins, and washed by the blood of Christ, we were justified. In addition, we were regenerated with a divine, spiritual, heavenly, kingly, and royal life. Thus, we are now able to reign in life as kings.<p>The gospel which is commonly preached today does not include the matter of reigning in life. We may have heard only that we were sinners and that if we believed in the Lord Jesus, God would forgive us; then we would be redeemed and regenerated in order to have the divine life. This is right, but according to Paul’s word in Romans, there is much more. Paul tells us that we were saved with a life which is not only divine but also royal and kingly. It is a life which is able to reign (5:17). We have received a life which not only gives us the ability to be spiritual, heavenly, and divine, but also gives us the ability to reign. In this life we reign over all the negative things.
