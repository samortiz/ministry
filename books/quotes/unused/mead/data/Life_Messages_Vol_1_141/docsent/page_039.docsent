   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE LIFE WAY TO TAKE THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You may think it is awkward English to title this message "The Life Way to Take the Word," but I want to suggest some ways for you to get more life from your reading of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not say "The Living Way " because sometimes "living" connotes excitement or loudness rather than life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we consider how the Word can bring us into life, we shall answer some questions based on the previous message.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have been considering the context of the verse, "Abstain from all appearance of evil" 1 Thes 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the verse before and the verse after, it seems that if our behavior is proper, God will sanctify us wholly and preserve us blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is this the case, or is it that the sanctifying life within results in a high standard of behavior?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sanctification is surely a matter of life, but both sanctification and life will keep us away from all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The young people especially need to be familiar with 1 Thessalonians 5:22.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For your own safeguard you need to avoid all appearance of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not think you are too spiritual to be affected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Run away from anything that bears the appearance of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just a quick glance can stain your thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the sake of others and for your own sake, you must be careful; behind every appearance of evil, evil is lurking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even after fifty years of seeking to walk in the Spirit, I still have no confidence in my flesh; it could still do any kind of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In north China around 1928 there was a strong Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some of those who experienced the filling of the Spirit felt they no longer had any flesh and could not sin; men and women began to live together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The resulting fornication brought such shame to the Lord's name that for a long time afterwards the gospel had no entry among the people there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you see how the appearance of evil leads to evil?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not think you are being religious to practice a holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our mentality can so easily be under the subtle usurping of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the years I have been in this country I have stressed that Christ is in opposition to religion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now the enemy has come in and twisted my words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some are saying it is religious to read the Bible and pray at a regular time every day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some say that coming into a meeting quietly is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some have stopped meeting regularly on Sundays so as not to be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is religion?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is any kind of worship or service to God without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If in a meeting you are silent with Christ, you are not religious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If in a meeting you are shouting without Christ, you are religious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Neither silence nor shouting is right, and neither is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The question is whether Christ is in what you are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not to have regular church meetings is a deception of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not have confidence in people; truth is our center.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if the Apostle Paul were to come and contradict his writings in the New Testament, we would have to reject him see Gal 1:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If I were to propose that you worship idols, you would have to refuse and cast me out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must stand for the truth and not regard any man's person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is it good to kneel down to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ephesians 3:14 says, "I bow my knees unto the Father," indicating that there was something heavy on Paul's heart and he was not praying in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are heavily burdened and want to kneel down, and your environment allows it, go ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If not, there is no need to make kneeling a formal legality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have to choose between corporate morning watch and a private time with the Lord, how should we decide?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Corporate morning watch is helpful, but a private time is more crucial to your personal contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How you choose depends upon your need.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The elders can also make a decision in this regard, but you are not obliged to follow it.</S>
