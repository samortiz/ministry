by the Resurrection of Christ</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S.S. 2:8-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In order to empower and encourage His lover to rise up and get away from her down situation in her introspection of the self:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ empowers her by showing her the power of His resurrection by the gazelle&rsquo;s leaping upon the mountains and the young hart&rsquo;s skipping upon the hills&mdash;2:8-9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is by this power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection that we, the lovers of Christ, determine to take the cross by denying our self (Matt. 16:24).</li>
		<li>It is also by this power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection that we, the lovers of Christ, are enabled to be conformed to His death (Phil. 3:10), to be one with His cross as staying in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the precipice (2:14).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ encourages her by the flourishing riches of His resurrection&mdash;2:11-13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The dormant days (winter) are past and the trials (rain) are over and gone.</li>
		<li>The life in all appearances is blossoming.</li>
		<li>The time of praising&mdash;singing&mdash;has come.</li>
		<li>The fruit tree has ripened in its fruits.</li>
		<li>The vines are in blossom, giving forth their fragrance.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, is resurrection (John 11:25) before His death, indicating that the entirety of the Triune God is resurrection in the universe:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ as the God-man in His humanity was made the firstborn Son of God in resurrection (Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29).</li>
	<li>Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45).</li>
	<li>God regenerated many sons through the resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3), making them His new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit as the reality of His resurrection (John 11:25):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The resurrection of Christ is linked with the Spirit who gives life.</li>
	<li>This life-giving Spirit indwells our spirit (Rom. 8:11; Eph. 2:22).</li>
	<li>Hence, our regenerated spirit indwelt by the life-giving Spirit becomes the Holiest of all as God&rsquo;s dwelling place linked with the Holiest of all in the third heaven (Heb. 4:16).</li>
	<li>This Christ as the life-giving Spirit becomes the heavenly ladder that brings heaven to earth and joins the earth to heaven at Bethel&mdash;God&rsquo;s dwelling place in the spirit of the believers on earth (Gen. 28:11-22; John 1:51).</li>
	<li>We have to discern our spirit from our soul:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In our soul we are the old man (Eph. 4:22), the soulish man, the natural man (1 Cor. 2:14).</li>
		<li>In our spirit we are the new man (Eph. 4:24), the spiritual man (1 Cor. 2:14-15), that lives and walks in our spirit, as God&rsquo;s Holiest of all, indwelt by and mingled with the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ.</li>
		<li>It is in such a mingled spirit that we participate in and experience the resurrection of Christ, the reality of which is the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit, the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
