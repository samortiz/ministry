   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Contacting Christ with Our Human Spirit by Speaking to Him</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, you have to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To recognize is something in your mentality, your understanding, but to contact Him is something different.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have pointed out, to contact anything you have to exercise the right organ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To contact my voice, for example, you must exercise your ears.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now Christ is the Spirit, so you have to exercise your human spirit to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spirit is the deepest, inmost part of your whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To contact Christ, realizing that He is the living Savior and the Spirit, you simply must exercise the inmost part of your being to talk with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times I have told people not to compose a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Simply be like a little child who comes to his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a little child comes to his mother, there is no need for him to compose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He simply expresses what he feels within.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Simply come to Christ; realize that He is so living and that He is the Spirit so available and close to you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then express yourself from the very inmost part of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever you feel within, just tell Him, even with broken sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you feel that you are wrong with God or wrong with man whether with your parents, with your schoolmate, or with others simply tell Him, "Lord Jesus, I am wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am wrong with God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am wrong with certain persons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am wrong with so many things."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just tell Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not consider how to compose your utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no need for that.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Simply express yourself from within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you feel that you are sorrowful and have much trouble, just tell Him, "Lord, I am so sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have so many problems."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Tell Him what your problems are in a living, practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the previous message I recounted how I preached the gospel to a judge.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He asked me how he could believe, and I told him that he had to exercise the right organ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you exercise your nose to smell a voice, you cannot substantiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you exercise your eyes to look at the voice, you cannot receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, if you exercise your ears, the hearing organ will substantiate the substance of the voice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The right organ to substantiate Christ is your human spirit, your inmost part.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That day I also told the judge, "Sir, I suggest you go home tonight, close your door, and talk with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He asked me in what way he should talk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I said, "In whatever way you can.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Simply talk."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He did this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He went back that night and told his wife and his only child, "Please go to the other room.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have some business to do."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He closed the door and knelt down.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His wife looked into the room through the window.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What a surprise that was.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She said, "What is he doing there?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is something completely new."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He prayed there, and then he went to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nothing seemed to happen at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later, however, he told me that the next morning, while he was going to court to take care of a case, the whole universe changed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The heavens, the earth, and everything was new.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everything was lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He looked at a dog, and the dog was lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He looked at a cat, and the cat was lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He looked at everything, and everything was lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He began to laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While he was taking care of his case, he was laughing in the court.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The secretary and the other people could not understand what had happened to this judge.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At noontime he went back home, rejoicing and laughing all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When he got home, his wife asked him, "What?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Did you find a million dollars?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What makes you so happy?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He said, "I do not know; I am just happy."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then he referred himself to one of the young brothers who was a student in college.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That young brother told him, "Sir, you have to realize that this is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You have already shared in salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Not long after that, the judge gave up his position.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As an elderly brother in Taiwan, he recently went to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Try this, dear friends.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I would suggest that tonight you find a place to be in private with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Open yourself from your inmost part to say something to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You do not need to compose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Simply tell Him what you have on your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Tell him in broken language.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Tell him in such a way as to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do not do this only once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is just a start.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>From this time on, time after time you have to contact Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you would ask me how many times I contact Christ daily, I could not tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All the time I simply contact this living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I do not even have a definite time for this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I pray all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is just as the air to me; I simply live in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Can you tell me how many times you breathe every day?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you can, I am afraid that you are seriously sick, struggling to breathe once, twice, and a third time.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you are a healthy person, though, you do not know how many times you breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All the time you just breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You need to contact Christ your Savior in such a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Forget about Christianity; forget about religion.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We are not helping you to receive a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We are helping you to realize such a living One, the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Learn to recognize Him and contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We all need to learn how to receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This means that you have to open yourself from within.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You have to open your whole being to Christ and tell Him, "Lord Jesus, not only do I recognize You as my Savior, but now I open myself to You and receive You into me as my life and my everything."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Not many Christians know how to do this, and not many practice to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>To pray is one thing, but to receive Christ is another.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Many persons pray to Christ, but they do not have the realization of how much they have to receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We have to learn that we must receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He is living and real, so you must open yourself to receive Him again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We all have to learn to receive the living Christ, not merely a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Regrettably, today millions of people are Christians in name.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>They have taken the religion, but they have not received Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I have been to Europe a few times.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In France or Belgium, if you ask people, "Are you a Christian?" they may say, "Why not?"</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I learned not to ask people in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If you ask this, you will offend them.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>One day in the Philippines when I took a taxi, I had the thought to ask the driver if he was a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He also was offended.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He said, "Why not?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If I am not a Christian, then what am I?"</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>However, this is a Christian only in name, a Christian in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I realized that he did not have Christ within him.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>To have Christianity is one thing, but to have Christ is another.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In actuality, there is not such a word as Christianity in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Rather, there is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>What we are doing is not to help you to accept Christianity as a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We are helping you to realize the proper way to receive the living Christ into you.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>What you need is not Christianity but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Some may ask how they can receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The way to receive Christ is to open yourself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Simply open to Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>He is the Spirit, and He is now within you.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Learn to open yourself to Him all the time, saying, "Lord Jesus, I am closed to everything else but open to You."</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>I can assure you that whether tonight or tomorrow, or this week or next week, something will happen to you within.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>You will receive the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>You will sense the loveliness of Christ, and you will sense the light, the power, the life, and the love of Christ within you.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>You must recognize Christ as the One we have spoken of here, and you have to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Always say something to Him, not from your mentality but from your heart and spirit, from your inmost part.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>You should not hate anyone, but even if you do hate someone, you should tell Christ, "Lord Jesus, now I am going to hate someone.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Lord, be with me while I hate him."</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Simply say a word to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Then He will help you to know how to hate.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>He will help you to know whether or not to hate that person, and eventually He will help you to drop your hating.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Simply speak to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Make him a Friend in whatever you do.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>If you are going to a movie, just tell Him, "Lord Jesus, I am interested in the movie, and I am going to see it."</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Talk with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>This is the best way for you to contact Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Learn to say something to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Do not keep anything hidden from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Be exposed and open before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Tell Him everything that is on your heart, open to Him, and learn always to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>This is the best prayer.</S>
