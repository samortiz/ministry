Revelation 21:10</H2><P>"And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God." </P><P>"And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain" is in contrast to "And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness" in 17:3.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revelation 21:11</H2><P>"Having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal." </P><P>This city especially has the glory of God. In ancient times the glory of God in the temple was not obvious since it appeared like a cloud.</P><P>"Her light." Is this light the glory of God? The answer is no, because in verse 23 "the glory of God illumined it" and the Lamb is the lamp of the city. The illumination of the glory of God is upon everything, but the shining of the lamp is limited to one place. Formerly, the shining in the Holy of Holies was by the glory of God, while the shining in the Holy Place was by the seven lamps. In 4:5 of this book, the seven lamps of fire are mentioned in relation to the Holy Spirit before the throne. Concerning the Holy Spirit's being sent forth into all the earth, it is the seven Spirits.</P><P>"Crystal" is transparent. Today the shining of the sun is not even universal, but the light of the new city in that day will be transparent. We do not know what color this light will be. All that we know is that it will be beautiful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Gates of the City<br>(Revelation 21:12-13; cf. verse 21)</H2><P>"It had a great and high wall and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. On the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates." </P><P>Both verses 12 and 21 mention "twelve gates." According to verse 21 the street is singular in number. Since there are twelve gates, it should follow that there are twelve streets. How can there be only one street? The street in verse 21 is like a square in the middle of the city, around which are roads. Since every side of the city has three gates, every side must also have three roads. "And at the gates twelve angels." The angels here are not kings; they are the guards of the gates of the new city. "And names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel." Israel represents the law of God. "And the twelve gates were twelve pearls" (21:21). Pearl represents the righteousness of God. Thus, we can see that one enters the gates of God according to God's law and righteousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Height of the City<br>(Revelation 21:14-17)</H2><P>"And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. And he who spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall. And the city lies square, and its length is as great as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel." </P><P>Verse 14 says, "And the wall of the city had twelve foundations." Verse 16 says, "He measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal." Then verse 17 says, "He measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits." The city is twelve thousand stadia in length, width, and height. (One stadia is equal to 606.75 feet.) The total height of the city is twelve thousand stadia, but the height of the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits. The height of twelve thousand stadia is measured from the bottom foundation all the way to the throne of God. The numbers in this chapter are either twelve or multiples of twelve. Twelve thousand stadia is a multiple of twelve, and twelve is the number of eternal completion.</P><P>The wall of the city has twelve foundations. Each layer probably is smaller than the layer under it, similar to the shape of a pyramid. Thus, all twelve layers can be seen.</P><P>On the foundations are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (v. 14). The apostles represent the grace of God; therefore, the grace of God makes up the foundations of the wall of the city.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_078.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_080.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 79</div><br></body></html>
