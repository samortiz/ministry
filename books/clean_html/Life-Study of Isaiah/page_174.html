<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Inner Temple for God's Dwelling</H2><P>We have to see the central thought of God toward the positive ones, His chosen people. The positive ones are the ones who were chosen, called, redeemed, and saved by God, the ones who have been regenerated and are being transformed into the divine image. God to them is not just an ordinary dwelling place. God to them is a sanctuary, and the sanctuary is the inner temple for God's dwelling. The most inward part of the temple is the Holy of Holies, the dwelling place of God. God's dwelling becomes our dwelling. Such a revelation of God as our sanctuary should cause us to aspire to live a life with God as our roommate all the time. We need to have definite, intimate, and sweet times with God as our roommate. We should live, stay, and dwell all the time with God and in God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Holy Place for the Priests<br>to Stay and to Serve God</H2><P>Christ is the sanctuary, the Holy Place, for us as the priests to stay and to serve God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Incarnated Christ<br>Being a Tabernacle to God's People</H2><P>When God was incarnated to be a man, He tabernacled among men on earth. The incarnated Christ is a tabernacle to God's people (John 1:14). He is the tabernacle of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The God-man, Christ,<br>Being the Inner Temple of God</H2><P>When Jesus came out to minister, He told the Jewish people that He was God's temple (John 2:19, 21). The God-man, Christ, is the inner temple of God. In John 1 He is God's tabernacle; in John 2 He is God's temple. The book of Isaiah, written about seven hundred years before the incarnation of Christ, prophesied that this coming One would be the sanctuary of God's chosen people for them to live with God, taking God as their roommate.</P><P>When we enjoy Him as our dwelling place and as our roommate, we have light, air, water, food, and everything that we need. When I am away from my home, the place where I stay may have many things, but it does not have what I have at home to meet my needs. There is no place on earth as good as our home. Whenever I return to my home, I have a feeling of "home, sweet home." Our home today is a person&#151;Christ, who is also God's dwelling place.</P>
