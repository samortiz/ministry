   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is to save us, the sinners, from God's condemnation Rom 5:16b, 18a and also from Satan's death Rom 5:12, 21a; John 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As sinners, we have condemnation over us from God and also death within us from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The condemnation of God is dissolved by Christ as the covenant, and the death that comes from Satan is annulled by Christ as the light that issues in life John 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is to bring us, the believers, into the divine life that we may become God's heirs to inherit God with all His riches as our divine inheritance Rom 5:18b; 8:17a; Gal 3:29b; Acts 26:18b .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These items constitute the substance of the gospel according to the ministry of the apostle Paul in the three books of Romans, Galatians, and 1 Corinthians.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>as the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's life germinates us by Christ as the life-giving Spirit Eph 2:5; 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to beget us unto the divine sonship, that we may have the sonship of God and be the sons of God John 1:12-13; Rom 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As sons of God, we are also heirs who will inherit God Rom 8:17a; Eph 1:13-14a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For us to inherit God as our inheritance, we need Christ to satisfy the requirements of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Also, we need Christ to be the light that issues in the divine life so that we can be regenerated to be God's heirs to inherit Him as our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's life also germinates us to renew us, the old man Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We were not only sinful and dead, but also old.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So, we need to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to be renewed not merely by being washed but by being germinated with God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's life also germinates us to transform and conform us into the glorious image of God's firstborn Son, making us, the many sons of God, like the Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is accomplished by life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Begetting, renewing, transformation, and conformation are all carried out by life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Finally, God's life germinates us to glorify us with the divine glory Rom 8:30b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The divine glory is the expression of God's divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God's life is expressed, it becomes the shining glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The above matters are the substance of the gospel according to the ministries of the apostles John and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, John ministered on life, and then Paul ministered on righteousness and life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In his Gospel and in the beginning of his first Epistle, the apostle John did not touch the matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later in 1 John, he did touch God's righteousness 2:28 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But Paul was different.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul touched God's righteousness first, then God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 5:18 says that God justifies us unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, justification brings us into life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we receive God's justification according to Christ as God's righteousness, the issue in us of this justification is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, justification is unto life.</S>
