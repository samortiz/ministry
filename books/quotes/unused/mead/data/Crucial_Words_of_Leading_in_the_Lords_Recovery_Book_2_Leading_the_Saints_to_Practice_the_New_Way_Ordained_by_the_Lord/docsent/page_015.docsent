   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Earnestly Desiring</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Practicing to Prophesy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The elders should also earnestly desire and practice to prophesy 1 Cor 14:1, 31, 39 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we desire earnestly to prophesy and speak for God, there will be an outward manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Prophesying requires our continual practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Take myself as an example; I have neither attended a seminary nor passed through the training, as some of us have; nevertheless, I learned my speaking posture and gestures by practicing in front of a large mirror on my mother s dresser.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every day I practiced my articulation, my bearing, and other aspects related to prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes I went to the seashore to exercise my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I always endeavored to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every one of us, especially the young people, should have the attitude and spirit that although we do not know how to speak for the Lord today, we will learn to do so in a month, and that in two months we will be able to speak even better.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not remain as elders and co-workers yet be unable to speak year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must learn to speak in a way that is both appealing and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This requires that we exercise to touch the Lord in spirit and continually enter into the Holy of Holies to touch God s throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This should not be an empty saying; it should be our living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some elders are relatively young; it is not appropriate for them to continue to serve as elders according to the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they truly desire to be elders, they must endeavor to change.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>History shows that Christianity has propagated the most within the past four to five hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today in Taiwan, however, Buddhism is greatly propagated; their books can be found everywhere, in big streets and in small alleys.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems that we can sleep and eat peacefully while letting the days pass by.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Few among us care for the gospel and even for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the aggressive activities of other religions should be a warning to us that we are losing out to them on the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope that we can all receive this word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today whether we are elders or co-workers, we must realize that this is our common obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not remain in the old way; rather, we should endeavor to advance and not try to find an excuse for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must rise up, whether willingly, reluctantly, or under compulsion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps some will say that this involves too much of man s endeavor and is too much out of the flesh, but we should ask, Do you mean to say that remaining quiet, unmoved, and unchanged is to be spiritual and not fleshly?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Spirituality always leads to a result.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Matthew 12:33 the Lord Jesus said, Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At present, we do not have much fruit; what can we say?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Inwardly, I have a painful and heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who need to confess their sins should rise up to confess them, those who need to repent should rise up to repent, those who are still asleep should wake up, and those who still want to take the old way should no longer think about it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must all rise up and endeavor to take the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have been damaged by the old way for long enough.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The elders and co-workers must be on the alert, rise up, pursue the truth earnestly, and bear fruit so that their function can be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, they need to desire earnestly that they may prophesy and exercise to practice prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Excelling in the Exercise of Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To practice prophesying is to excel in the exercise of gifts 1 Cor 14:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since we earnestly desire to be spiritual, we must seek that we may excel in the gifts for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In doing so, we must not seek the inferior gifts, such as speaking in tongues, which are not profitable for the building of the church; rather, we must seek earnestly the gifts that build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is to excel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to excel in such a way, we must steep ourselves in the truth and delve deeper into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to read the Life-studies every day for ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we read, we need to be prepared to minister something for three to five minutes in the district meeting on the coming Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not speak aimlessly; rather, we should share what we have enjoyed in our reading of the Life-studies over the past six days.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this way the meetings will surely be different from in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The purpose of the change in system is so that everyone would rise up and stop sleeping peacefully when they sense that there is a need.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many have slept peacefully year after year, behaving as if there is no difference between the old system and the new system.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all need to rise up to encourage one another and not blame one another.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The responsibility lies with us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have no reason to blame others; we need to be responsible before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all need to ask the Lord how we can function properly.</S>
