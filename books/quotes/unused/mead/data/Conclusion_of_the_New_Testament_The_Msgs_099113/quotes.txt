[2]  In these messages on the believers we shall cover the believers' status, designations, symbols, life, nature, past, present, and future.
[3]  Before we were saved we were not only sinners constituted of sin we were sin itself.
[4]  Hence, when Christ became a man in flesh John 1:14 , He was made sin not sinful on our behalf to be judged by God that we might become God's righteousness in Him. e. Condemned
[5]  Referring to the sons of disobedience, Ephesians 2:3 says, "Among whom also we all behaved ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest."
[6]  To Perish with the Devil in the Lake of Fire
[7]  Revelation 20:10 says that the Devil "was cast into the lake of fire," and verse 15 says that those not found written in the book of life are likewise cast into the lake of fire.
[8]  In this message we shall begin to consider the believers' status after they have been saved.
[9]  Now the believers are children of God, sons of God, partakers of the divine nature, heirs of God, priests of God, slaves of God, brothers of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, members of Christ as the Head of the Body, partakers of Christ as God's Anointed, slaves of Christ, priests of Christ, co-kings of Christ, partakers of the Holy Spirit, and heavenly citizens.
[10]  Even at times when we are weak or backsliding we still have the deep conviction that we are children of God, for once we have been born of God we are His children forever. a. Born of God, Not of Blood, Nor of the Will of Flesh, Nor of the Will of Man
[11]  Through Their Receiving of the Son of God by Believing in His Name
[12]  When we believed in Christ, the divine life with the divine nature in fact, the divine being of the Triune God Himself entered into us, and we were born of God to become sons of God.
[13]  a. Having Received the Spirit of Sonship with the Sonship
[14]  As sons of God, we have received the spirit of sonship with the sonship Rom 8:15; Gal 4:5-6 .
[15]  The sons of God have the life, the position, the right, the privilege, and the blessings of a son.
[16]  After being saved, the believers are also partakers of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .
[17]  Through the precious and exceedingly great promises given by God, we, the believers in Christ, who is our God and Savior, have become partakers of His divine nature in an organic union with Him.
[18]  The New Testament believers become heirs of God not through the law or through their fleshly father but through God, even the Triune God the Father who sent forth the Son and the Spirit Gal 4:4, 6 , the Son who accomplished redemption for sonship v. 5 , and the Spirit who carries out the sonship within us v. 6 .
[19]  Titus 3:7b says that the believers are "heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
[20]  In this verse we see that the believers are not only sons but also heirs who are qualified to inherit the Father's estate Rom 4:14; 8:17; Gal 3:29; 4:7 .
[21]  This eternal life is for us not only to live and enjoy God in this age, but also to inherit all the riches of what He is to us in the coming age and in eternity.
[22]  God gives His Holy Spirit to us not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God.
[23]  g. To Share with All the Saints in the Light the Triune God Embodied in Christ as Their Portion
[24]  Acts 26:18 speaks of the forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Christ.
[25]  This divine inheritance is the Triune God with all He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people.
[26]  To Inherit an Inheritance Kept in the Heavens as a Living Hope
[27]  First Peter 1:3 tells us that through the resurrection of Christ we have been regenerated unto a living hope.
[28]  As heirs of God, the believers are joint heirs of Christ according to the promise and the hope of eternal life, through justification by the grace of Christ and regeneration in the resurrection of Christ, to inherit the Triune God as their inheritance with the Holy Spirit as the pledge, to share with all the saints in the light the Triune God embodied in Christ as their portion, to be glorified with Christ, and to inherit an inheritance kept in the heavens as a living hope.
[29]  In this message we shall cover further aspects of the believers' status after they are saved.
[30]  It is a great matter that we, who once were sinners, sons of disobedience, children of wrath, children of the Devil, enemies of God, and sons of Gehenna, are now priests of God serving Him.
[31]  Revelation 20:6 indicates that being a priest is a matter in resurrection.
[32]  In His resurrection and with His divine life Christ has made us living priests to serve God.
[33]  a. Predestinated to Be Conformed to the Image of God's Son
[34]  Romans 8:29 says, "Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers."
[35]  The Greek word rendered "predestinated" can also be translated "marked out beforehand."
[36]  Before the foundation of the world, God marked us out to a certain destiny being conformed to the image of His Son.
[37]  Hebrews 2:11 says, "He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers."
[38]  "He who sanctifies" is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and "those who are being sanctified" are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God.
[39]  We have seen that we are brothers of Christ as the firstborn Son of God.
[40]  Because we are organically united with Christ and because Christ dwells in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 and makes His home in our heart Eph 3:17 , our entire being, including our purified body, becomes a member of Him.
[41]  As members of Christ produced out of Him to be His parts, we are composed and tempered together by God to be Christ's Body 1 Cor 12:24-27; Rom 12:5 .
[42]  In 1 Corinthians 12:27 Paul declares, "You are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
[43]  By Holding Fast the Beginning of the Assurance Firm to the End
[44]  Hebrews 3:14 tells us that we are partners of Christ by holding fast the beginning of the assurance firm to the end. We must hold fast what we have believed from the beginning and have no doubt concerning it.
[45]  If we hold fast the beginning of the assurance firm to the end, we shall keep ourselves in the partnership with Christ.
[46]  In this message we shall cover the three remaining aspects of the believers' status after being saved: co-kings of Christ, partakers of the Holy Spirit, and heavenly citizens.
[47]  It will be in the millennial kingdom that the believers will be co-kings of Christ.
[48]  Revelation 20:4 and 6 both speak of the overcoming believers reigning with Christ "a thousand years," referring to the coming age of the millennial kingdom.
[49]  Having Tasted the Good Word of God and the Works of Power of the Coming Age
[50]  In Greek "word" here is rhema, the instant word of God.
[51]  The good word of God in 6:5 refers to the word of the beginning of Christ mentioned in Hebrews 6:1, which is the milk the Hebrew believers tasted Heb 5:12-13 when they believed in the Lord.
[52]  The good word of God as the word of the beginning of the Christ is elementary and includes repentance, faith in God, baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection, and eternal judgment, all of which are related to Christ's earthly ministry.
[53]  One kind belongs to the spirit with the divine life, and another kind, which includes the works not of life but of power, involves miracles.
[54]  Works of power are related to our physical body, not to our spirit.
[55]  Finally, in their status after being saved the believers are heavenly citizens.
[56]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIVE THE BELIEVERS THEIR DESIGNATIONS 1
[57]  In this message we shall begin to cover the four designations of the believers given in the New Testament: disciples, believers, saints, and Christians.
[58]  Those Who Have Believed in Christ as the Son of God according to God's New Testament Economy of the Faith
[59]  Anyone who does not have faith in Christ, who does not believe in Christ, is certainly not a believer.
[60]  Those Who Have Received Christ as Their Generating Life for Them to Become the Children of God
[61]  The believers are those who have received Christ as their generating life for them to become the children of God.
[62]  John 1:12 and 13 say, "As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
[63]  We have seen that in the New Testament the believers in Christ are designated disciples and believers.
[64]  First Corinthians 1:2 tells us that we have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.
[65]  To be sanctified in Christ Jesus is to be sanctified in the element and sphere of Christ.
[66]  Christ is the element and sphere that separated us unto God, made us holy unto Him, when we believed in Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him.
[67]  By the Holy Spirit with God's Holy Nature Dispositionally
[68]  Those Who Bear a Strong Testimony for Christ That Makes Them Distinct and Peculiar in the Eyes of the Unbelievers
[69]  Whereas in the time of Peter and Paul Christian was a term of reproach, today it should bear a positive significance, that is, a man of Christ, one who is one with Christ, not only belonging to Him but having His life and nature in an organic union with Him, and who is living by Him, even living Him, in his daily life.
[70]  In the New Testament there are even more symbols of the believers than of the Spirit.
[71]  This indicates that as God, Christ, and the Spirit are mysterious, so the believers also are mysterious.
[72]  If we realize that we are sinful, fallen, and lost and if we truly believe in the Lord Jesus Christ that He is the Son of God incarnated to be a man, that He died on the cross for our sins, that He was resurrected physically and spiritually, and that He is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us as our life and everything, we are certainly the wheat of life.
[73]  On the one hand, the Lord Jesus says that the believers are wheat; on the other hand, He tells us that the believers are the good seed.
[74]  By the Gospel of the Kingdom of the Heavens
[75]  The Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations" Matt 24:14 .
[76]  For us to be the salt of the earth means that we keep the earth from being fully corrupted.
[77]  This means that we exercise our influence over the earth created by God to keep it in its original condition.
[78]  In this message we shall cover six more symbols of the believers: a lamp, a city situated upon a mountain, the sun, virgins, plants, and living stones.
[79]  Eventually our shining will give glory to the Father.
[80]  Consummating in the New Jerusalem Situated upon the Golden Mountain, Shining over and Enlightening the New Earth with the Divine Light
[81]  Revelation 21:18b says, "The city was pure gold, like pure glass," and verse 11 says, "Having the glory of God.
[82]  Another New Testament symbol of the believers is virgins.
[83]  Matthew 25:1 says, "Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom."
[84]  Paul in 1 Corinthians 3:6-8 illustrates the believers as plants.
[85]  The Lord's word in Matthew 15:13 conveys the same illustration.
[86]  With Christ as Their Shepherd, Who Laid Down His Soul Life for Them That They May Have the Divine Life
[87]  The many grains of wheat are produced through the death and resurrection of Christ.
[88]  In His work on the cross the Lord Jesus died as a grain of wheat falling into death for the release of the divine life.
[89]  The Lord Jesus fell into the ground and died so that His divine element, His divine life, would be released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many believers in resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 , just as a grain of wheat has its life element released by falling into the ground and growing up out of the ground to produce much fruit, that is, to bring forth many grains.
[90]  Concerning this, Peter says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead" 1 Pet 1:3 .
[91]  In addition to being many grains of wheat, the believers are also the many branches of the vine.
[92]  This vine, which is Christ, with its branches, which are the believers in Christ, is the organism of the Triune God in God's economy to grow with His riches and to express His divine life.
[93]  As branches of the vine, we need to abide in the vine, the Christ of God.
[94]  In this message we shall cover five more symbols of the believers used in the New Testament: vessels of mercy unto honor and glory, branches of the cultivated olive tree, a spectacle, the offscouring of the world and the scum of all things, and the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[95]  The believers in Christ are vessels of mercy unto honor and glory.
[96]  As vessels of mercy unto honor and glory, we were chosen by God according to His sovereign mercy Rom 9:11-16 .
[97]  The Bible reveals that man was created as a vessel to contain God.
[98]  In His creation of man, God made man a vessel to contain Him with the intention of coming into this vessel and filling it with Himself.
[99]  When God enters into the vessels created by Him, He finds that they are a proper match for Him.
[100]  God created us in such a way that we are able to take Him into us and contain Him as our life and life supply, to the end that we may be one with Him to express what He is and that He may be glorified in us and with us.
[101]  Prepared by God unto Glory through Glorification the Last Step of God's Full Salvation
[102]  In 1 Corinthians 4:9 the believers are symbolized by the unusual figure of a spectacle, a public gazingstock: "God has set forth us the apostles last of all, as doomed to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men."
[103]  In the New Testament all the overcoming believers, not only the apostles, are likened to such a spectacle, such a gazingstock for the public.
[104]  R. THE OFFSCOURING OF THE WORLD AND THE SCUM OF ALL THINGS
[105]  In this message we shall cover more symbols of the believers: threshing oxen, runners in a race and contenders in a game, workman in carpentry, nursing mother, father, wise master builder, ambassadors, stewards, captives of Christ in His triumphal procession, and incense-bearers.
[106]  The prize in verse 24 is a reward as an incentive, and this reward is an incorruptible crown, which the Lord will award His overcoming saints who win the race.
[107]  Second Timothy 2:15 says that Timothy should present himself "approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth."
[108]  This indicates that some of the believers who know the truth should learn to be workmen in carpentry to cut the word of the truth straight, that is, to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion.
[109]  In both 2 Corinthians 5:20 and Ephesians 6:20 Paul says that he and his co-workers were ambassadors of Christ.
[110]  An ambassador is one sent by a particular authority to contact certain people.
[111]  The faithful believers are ambassadors sent by God, the highest authority in the universe.
[112]  As captives of Christ in His triumphal procession, the believers celebrate and participate in Christ's triumph in their New Testament ministry, ministering Christ to others.
[113]  In this message we shall cover the following New Testament symbols of the believers: letters of Christ, mirrors, earthen vessels, pillars, luminaries in the world, good soldiers of Christ, and laboring husbandmen.
[114]  In 3:3 a letter of Christ does not mean a letter written by Christ; rather, this letter is a composition that uses Christ as the alphabet and conveys Christ as the contents.
[115]  A letter of Christ is one composed of Christ as the contents to convey Christ and express Him.
[116]  A letter of Christ is composed using Christ as the words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs.
[117]  Being Transformed into the Image of the Lord from Glory to Glory, Even as from the Lord Spirit
[118]  When we with unveiled face are beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done.
[119]  Thus, we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence, transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind Rom 12:2 , into His image.
[120]  To be transformed is to have Christ added into our being to replace what we are so that Christ may increase and our natural life may decrease.
[121]  According to 2 Corinthians 4:7, we have this treasure in earthen vessels "that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us."
[122]  In chapters two, three, and four of 2 Corinthians Paul uses five very significant and expressive symbols of the believers: captives in a triumphant procession for the celebration of Christ's victory, incense-bearers scattering the fragrance of Christ, letters written with Christ as the content, mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of Christ in order to be transformed into His glorious image, and earthen vessels containing the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure.
[123]  Philippians 2:15 reveals that the believers are luminaries in the world: "That you may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world."
[124]  Literally the Greek word translated "lights" here is luminaries, which reflect the light of the sun, Christ.
[125]  Because we have the divine life and nature, we have become luminaries reflecting Christ as the real sun.
[126]  Second Timothy 2:3 says, "Take your share in suffering evil as a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
[127]  We come now to the last four New Testament symbols of the believers: stars, the man-child, the firstfruit and the harvest, and jasper and other precious stones.
[128]  Participating in and Enjoying the Seven Spirits of God
[129]  In Revelation 3:1 the Lord Jesus refers to Himself as "He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars."
[130]  This indicates that the stars participate in and enjoy the seven Spirits of God.
[131]  As the stronger part of the universal woman, the man-child consists of the overcomers among the believers.
[132]  "Virgins" Who Were Not Defiled, Who Followed the Lamb Wherever He Went, and in Whose Mouth No Lie Was Found, for They Were without Blemish
[133]  Speaking of the firstfruit, Revelation 14:4 says: "These are they who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins.
[134]  The Harvest a. The Majority of the Believers Who Will Be Ripe Later Than the Firstfruit
[135]  Revelation 14:15 speaks of the harvest: "Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Send forth Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe."
[136]  The harvest of the earth is God's people on earth, the believers in Christ 1 Cor 3:9 .
