<h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S PRAYER IN THE GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE</h2><p>In His prayer in the garden of Gethsemane, it appears that He was afraid to take the cup. The cup represents the cross; it represents redemption. The Lord knew that man needed redemption. He came to the earth and lived for over thirty years for the purpose of going to the cross. Yet the Lord was not set on taking the cup; He was not set on going to the cross to accomplish redemption for man. He was seeking God's will. He was obedient to God's will. The Lord could choose to go to the cross or not to go to the cross. He could choose to take the cup or refuse the cup. The Lord's ultimate intention was to do the will of God. This is not an easy thing to do. God told Abraham to take Isaac to Mount Moriah and offer him up on the altar as a burnt offering. It was hard for Abraham to obey. But when Abraham took up his knife and was ready to kill, God told him to stop. This was also difficult for Abraham. He had already lifted up his knife, and it was hard for him to drop it. If Christ had refused to give up His crucifixion, His obedience would not have been perfect. Right up to the point when He was about to die, the Lord was not set on taking the cross. It would not have been a perfect obedience if the Lord had been inflexible about His crucifixion. In this respect the prayer in the garden of Gethsemane was a most profound exercise. Right up to the point of His death, He was still unsettled as to His taking of the cross; He was still inquiring of God. To Him the cross was dispensable; He was not decided on this issue. He could take the cup, or He could reject it. Yet He would not insist on His own will, but only God's will. This was the Lord's mind.</p><p>Throughout the ages many theologians have seriously offended the Lord by foolishly misjudging Him. They thought that the Lord was afraid to die, that He was weak in His flesh and fearful of the bitter cup. Actually, the Lord was not afraid of death. He was trying to be certain of God's will. He could drink the cup, or He could refuse the cup, but God's will must be done. The Lord did not pray that God would allow Him to act independently; He prayed that He would act according to God's will. To Him, God's will was absolute, while the cup was relative. Our Lord never acted against God's will. Once He was clear that the cross was God's will, He told the disciples, "Arise, let us be going" (Matt. 26:46). As they were leaving the garden, the persecutors came. Peter drew his sword and struck the ear of the slave of the high priest and took off his right ear. The Lord told Peter, "Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?" (John 18:11). After the Lord became clear that the cup was God's will, He no longer hesitated. The Lord was not set on dying; He was set on obeying. It is not enough to have a mind to die or to go to the cross. The Lord had a mind to obey!</p><h2 class="head1">THROUGH OBEDIENCE THE LORD RECEIVING<br />THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY</h2><p>Philippians 2 goes on to tell us that God highly exalted Christ and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, making Him Lord (vv. 9-11). The Lord proceeded from His divinity for the purpose of establishing God's authority. He was obedient unto death. In the end God raised Him from the dead and bestowed on Him the highest name&mdash;the name of Jesus. Now He is the Lord. We have to learn obedience every step of the way, just like Him. The Lord was obedient to the end, and God highly exalted Him and committed all authority to Him. Revelation 4 and 5 describe the situation after the Lord's ascension. All authority in heaven and on earth is no longer in God's hand; it has been given to Christ. No one can open God's scroll except the Lord (5:2, 5) because God has committed all authority to Him. Today He is God, and He is also man. He sits in heaven as a man.</p><p>Unless we are obedient all the way, we cannot express God's authority. Our submission to authority is the basis of becoming an authority. This is the straight pathway. Christ took this way before God made Him the authority. If we desire to be an authority, we must have a thorough understanding of authority and submission. We must not claim any authority for ourselves. We must have a mind to obey; we must have the mind in us that was in Christ Jesus. Even after a man becomes an authority, he must still have a mind to obey. He has to maintain this ground and practice obedience. No matter what position we have as an authority, we should still have a mind to obey. The sooner we have a mind to obey, the sooner God will make us an authority. We worship the Lord that He was so clear about the nature of authority.</p><p>Suppose the Father had said to the Lord at the end of His time on earth, "You have been on earth for thirty-three years, and You have finished the work that I have assigned to You. Now You can return to heaven." Even if the Lord had considered the cross for thirty-three years, He would have immediately returned to the Father; He would not have waited for the cross. This was the Lord's mind; He did not insist on His own will. God requires the same thing from us. He told Abraham to bring Isaac to the altar, and Abraham obeyed. Later He told Abraham to take Isaac back, telling him that his son would not die, and Abraham took Isaac back without any hesitation. God's requirement on us is no less than His requirement on Christ. We have to have this mind in us, which was in Christ Jesus. Only an obedient man can have the mind of Christ Jesus. If we have a mind that is set on obedience, God will be free to commit His authority to us just as He committed it to Christ. The scroll in Revelation 5 contains the mystery of the future of the universe. God did not open the scroll Himself. He committed it to the Lamb of God; Jesus of Nazareth was the One who opened it. God has left the execution of the plan of the universe to the Lamb. Through the Lord's absolute obedience, God entrusted such authority to Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH NEEDING TO TAKE<br />THE WAY OF OBEDIENCE</h2><p>We know that this is the end time and that God is recovering the church. He wants to entrust the church with His authority. During the past few days, we have seen that the church is the ultimate expression of God's authority. The church cannot fail. The church has failed during the past two thousand years, but from now on it cannot fail. It has to reach the glorious state described in Ephesians 4 and 5. In the future men will recognize authority through the church. How solemn is our responsibility today! We can no longer say that one church's failure will be compensated by another church's revival. We can fail no longer. Today the church must move at a rapid pace. God is recovering His authority through us today. Are we someone that God can trust? God's way hinges on us today. We have to be absolute in our obedience. We have to obey to the end. Otherwise, God will not have a recovery. Today rebellion still exists in the church, and unless we deal with this problem, there is no way for the church to be recovered.</p>
