   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The enjoyment of the soul-life today is wrapped up with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To gain the world for the enjoyment of the soul is to forfeit the life in the enjoyment of the kingdom in the coming age.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do bear the cross to follow Him by losing the enjoyment of our soul in this age, He will reward us with the enjoyment of the soul in the kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium will be the reward to the followers of Christ who remain under the killing of the cross on the pathway to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the dear ones who follow Christ in this way will be rewarded with the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
