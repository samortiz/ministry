   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LEADERSHIP IN THE LORD S MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us consider Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is not a long record of Apollos in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was not dissenting, but he somewhat remained in another flow 1 Cor 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no hint that Apollos intended to carry on another flow, but whatever he was and whatever he did gave people a different impression.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why after he worked in Corinth some could say that they were of Apollos 1 Cor 3:4 , and some were puffed up on behalf of Apollos against Paul 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Apollos was not wise.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he had been wise, he would have never behaved in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By the Lord s mercy, I can declare that in those eighteen years when I was involved in the work on mainland China, I was wise.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I never caused anyone to think that they could be puffed up on behalf of me against Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There was no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever the saints saw of me, my behavior, my way of living, my actions, the way I worked, my messages, and my speaking, they all considered to be absolutely one with Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I did not leave any loopholes for anyone to think that I was different from Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I believe that was the Lord s wisdom through His mercy given to me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our history since that time speaks a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among so many co-workers of Brother Nee, where is the recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I did not have any kind of thought to be the one to carry on the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even when I went to Taiwan, I was definitely sent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That was Brother Nee s proposal to the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I never had the thinking or the feeling that I was going to be the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even when I came to the United States, I did not have the thought of being the leader in the western world of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But where is the recovery today and under what kind of leadership?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some of the so-called co-workers claim that they were so close to Watchman Nee, but nearly not one church has ever been raised up by any of them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is altogether not wise for you to remain in the recovery taking this ministry on the one hand, and yet on the other hand to say something else.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not wise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not profitable to yourself or to your future.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may say you have a ministry, but this is not profitable to your ministry if you have one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You can never profit your ministry in the future in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, you have dispensed your future in a cheap way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The wise way is to stay, without any opinion, with the recovery which is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I want to be faithful and frank, and I want to make the situation clear to all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I do not believe that my being here is altogether of myself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, I believe that my being here is of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I want to see many of you rise up to be able to do the same thing that I am doing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I would never be jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I like to see this and I am for this!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ARMY</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AND THE CITIZENS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now you understand my standing, my heart, and where I am.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brothers, we need to be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are an army formed by His mercy and grace to fight the battle for the kingdom of the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The island of Taiwan has to be evangelized and truthized by this army within the next four years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the fulfilling of this purpose, I would not tolerate any kind of dissenting thought.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be a citizen of the United States is one thing, but to fight in the United States Army is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Gideon was called to take the army to fight the battle for Jehovah, the Lord told him that he had too many Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>7:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, the Lord chose three hundred men and told Gideon to send the others home.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This does not mean that whoever went back home was no longer an Israelite.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was still an Israelite, but he had nothing to do with the fighting army.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may be a member of a local church and yet have nothing to do with the ministry to fight the battle for the Lord s interest on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All of you are the elders, the co-workers, and the apprentice elders, the leading ones, in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am speaking to you all as the soldiers in the Lord s recovery, not to the citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am speaking to the soldiers of the army.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Are you going to remain in the army?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have to realize what the army is and what the army would do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The army has no capacity to take your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no time for the army to fool around.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The situation is quite urgent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The intention of this heavenly army is to evangelize and truthize Taiwan first and then the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One brother recently asked me if I could come to his part of the world to labor in a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His fellowship with me gave me the feeling that he is not fighting with us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>My burden is to take Taiwan first and then the United States second.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do not care for any particular region on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am for the Lord s recovery and I have the view to make this strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To my observation the best strategy is to take Taiwan first.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you are only for your part of the world this may disappoint you, but if you are for the Lord s recovery you ll say, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You may even have the burden to send some soldiers to join the army to evangelize Taiwan!</S>
