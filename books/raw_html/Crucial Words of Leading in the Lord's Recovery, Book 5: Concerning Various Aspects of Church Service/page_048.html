	 <h2 class="head1">DEVOTING TIME AND ENERGY<br />
TO COMPELLING OTHERS</h2>
<p>If we read the Gospel of Luke thoroughly, we will see that the age we are in today is the third stage of preaching the gospel. This stage requires that we go out to the roads and the hedges to compel people. Whomever we come across, we need to compel. We need to think of ways to compel our cousins, classmates, and colleagues until they believe in the Lord. Do not think that this is a small matter; this is the principle of preaching the gospel. In the first portion of Luke 19, Zaccheus obtained salvation and was therefore joyful; however, if he were the evil slave who did not go out and do business, he would lose his reward when the Lord returns. The first part of Luke 19 is a story of salvation, whereas the second part is concerning the reward.</p>
<p>We all are saved and have received one mina. Whether we will rule over ten cities or five cities in the future is a serious matter. In this stage the Lord is harsh. He did not say that it is easy to go out. It is indeed not easy to go out and reap the harvest; however, those who preach the gospel in this stage will receive a reward. It is not easy to lead a person to salvation, because the world is attracting people and daily occupying them. We must use all of our strength to compel others. In addition, we should never think that we will quickly lead people to salvation. If we can all practice to preach the gospel in the way of compelling, each one of us will bring at least one person to salvation every year.</p>
<p>Having a close relative who is not saved indicates that we have not devoted our time and energy to compelling people. Never look for an excuse and say that he is too superstitious to believe or that he is too hard. We should counter our excuses by compelling him to believe. Sometimes we can go and weep before our relative, at other times we can beg him, and still at other times we can go to his home and speak incessantly. No one can withstand a persistent person. As long as we are willing to bother him persistently, he will be saved. The gospel preaching in Taiwan must enter into this kind of reality. It is not sufficient for us only to invite people to come and hear the gospel. We must compel them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERY HOME AND EVERY SAINT<br />
PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN THE COMMUNITY</h2>
<p>According to the parable in Luke 14, we are in the third stage of preaching the gospel; hence, we must compel people to hear the gospel. Our preaching of the gospel should begin from the homes. Every home should preach the gospel. Currently we have small groups. When several families come together to have a small group meeting, they can bring unbelievers. We should bring our gospel friends, relatives, and friends to the small group and preach the gospel to them. After a period of time, when the small group is strong, we can preach the gospel by the homes.</p>
<p>Moreover, we should promote preaching the gospel in the community. This does not mean that the co-workers go and preach the gospel in the community, or that we invite people from different occupations to the meeting hall to hear the gospel. Rather, the elders and co-workers should receive a burden to encourage the working saints to preach the gospel. We can encourage the saints who are medical doctors, lawyers, legislators, nurses, or policemen to rise up and preach the gospel. The elders and co-workers need to kindle the spirit of the gospel in the saints and raise them up to preach the gospel to their colleagues. For instance, a brother who is a medical doctor can open his home, not to invite his relatives but to invite his colleagues and their families to his home for the gospel. The elders or co-workers also can contact the brothers who are doctors and encourage them to speak the gospel in their private clinics or in the hospitals where they work. Suppose a saint who is a legislator lives in housing appointed by the government, and his neighbors are all legislators. The elders can encourage this saint to open his home to invite his neighbors to hear the gospel. In this way we can gain some legislators and their families. The same principle can be applied to saints in any occupation.</p>
<p>The secret to promoting the gospel in the community lies in the promoters being burning, crazy, and going out to compel others. We shall compel the working saints by dragging them out one by one and bothering them until they cannot sleep peacefully unless they preach the gospel. If we are burning, we will be able to kindle others. It is not easy to make others burning. Therefore, those, especially the full-timers, who go to compel others, must be burning. Then they can go out and compel others. This is our job; every one of us must be burning for the gospel and crazy for the gospel. Since we are Christians and we cannot resign, we must go and compel others to receive the gospel. This is what the Lord has entrusted us with in the third stage of preaching the gospel.</p>
