   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY-NINE REVELATION 1:9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is significant that John calls himself a partaker in the endurance of Jesus at the beginning of a book which specifically deals with judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book of Revelation brings us to a point where God sets endurance aside and executes judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As soon as judgment is carried out there is no more need for endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Endurance is only needed when judgment lies in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John, as he is about to write on the subject of judgment, declares that he is still living in the realm of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before God opens up His judgments, John secures a spirit of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Revelation 6:10 we hear the cry, "How long?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who utter this complaint find it difficult to exercise any more endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who are they?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps they are the Old Testament saints, but certainly they are the pre-tribulation saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They cry for vengeance, for the execution of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If impatience is justified in any, it is justified in the dead saints rather than the living, for they have waited longer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But even those who have waited so long are told that the time of endurance has not expired.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has determined to avenge all His saints at one time, and the martyred saints are told to wait patiently until the number of martyrs is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's wrath is not poured out until the seventh trumpet sounds.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seven bowls are included in it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Officially, the time of God's patience is not over until then; therefore, His saints need to exercise endurance until then.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They must not exert force.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the time of Antichrist the children of God will readily fall into the snare of resorting to force, as seen in Revelation 13.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But God's appointment for His children during the day of His patience is non-resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The saints are to submit to being overcome v. 7 . If ever there was a holy war, it is the war against Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If ever there was reason for resistance, there will be a reason then.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If ever there was a righteous cause to fight, it is to fight against Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But God's Word on this very point says, "If anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he is to be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints" Rev 13:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Matthew 24 makes it very clear that at the time of Antichrist the children of God have only one responsibility, that is, to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the power of Antichrist nears its climax, all the saints must leave the cities and flee to the country, because government is related to the cities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must be prepared to flee without our possessions, because we will be unable to escape if we take time to collect them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Note the need of detachment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The warning to nursing and pregnant mothers and the exhortation to pray that our flight be neither in winter nor on a Sabbath emphasize the urgency of the matter of fleeing in the day of Antichrist's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no guarantee that those who flee will not be slain, but the best measure of security lies in fleeing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is our responsibility to warn men to flee if they fall under the power of Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Flight under such circumstances will not in any way reflect on the dignity of God's children; it is His distinct command.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fleeing will not present a problem to those who see the absolute spirituality of the church, and it will not be a hindrance to the functioning of the church, for a spiritual church can function in the simplest manner.</S>
