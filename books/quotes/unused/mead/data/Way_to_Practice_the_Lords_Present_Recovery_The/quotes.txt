[3]  CHAPTER ONE PRACTICING THE NEW WAY TO BUILD UP
[4]  THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14
[5]  In this book we want to fellowship concerning our need to pick up the new way to practice the Lord s present recovery.
[6]  In order to meet the Lord s present need, we must enter into two portions of His Word: 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4:11-16.
[7]  To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, and in our speaking for the Lord, we have to speak forth the Lord and speak the Lord into others.
[8]  THE NEW WAY TO BUILD UP THE BODY OF CHRIST
[9]  When I returned to Taipei in 1984, I was burdened of the Lord to find out a new, scriptural way for us to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[10]  Although we have seen the light concerning how to preach the gospel in the most effective way, we still are not too clear regarding how to have the home meetings.
[11]  The Epistles show us that the early churches often met in a certain saint s home, such as the church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla Rom 16:5 , the church in the house of Nymphas Col 4:15-16 , and the church in the house of Philemon Philem.
[12]  After we learned the proper way of preaching the gospel according to God s ordained way as revealed in the Bible, we began to ask how we should take care of the home meetings.
[13]  If we take the way of composing something to prophesy, we will have something to present to the saints in the church meetings every Lord s Day.
[14]  In order to have what is described by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 14, we must have the perfecting of the saints by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers in Ephesians 4.
[15]  Some have said that after the apostles establish the churches with the elders, they should keep their hands off, having nothing to do with the churches and elders anymore.
[16]  Acts 20 tells us that on Paul s way to Jerusalem, he could not forget his burden for the church in Ephesus.
[17]  Paul told them that he was with them for three years v. 31 , teaching them publicly and from house to house v. 20 . For Paul to teach the saints publicly means there was some public exhortation, probably in front of the saints as a congregation.
[18]  Fourth, we need to have church meetings to exhibit Christ and minister Christ to the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ by the developing and exercising of the saints organic functions.
[19]  IN THE PRECIOUS MATERIALS FOR GOD S BUILDING AND IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GIFTS
[20]  If we enjoy such a Christ, we will surely grow in life.
[21]  In the book of Ephesians, Paul tells us that the gifts the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are for the perfecting of the saints 4:11-12 .
[22]  Then Acts 20 shows us how the writer of Ephesians, the Apostle Paul, perfected the saints in Ephesus.
[23]  The record of Paul s practice in Acts 20 opens a window for us to see how to perfect the saints.
[24]  In Acts 20 Paul said that he did not shrink from declaring to the saints in Ephesus all the counsel of God v. 27 . According to his word in Acts 20, Paul surely taught prophesying to them.
[25]  In Acts 20 he told the elders of the church in Ephesus, You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time v. 18 . Paul was with the saints in Ephesus for three years.
[26]  He not only taught them publicly in meetings but also taught them from house to house v. 20 . Night and day, he did not cease admonishing each one of the saints with tears v. 31 . This teaches us how to perfect the saints.
[27]  We need to be like Paul, who did not shrink from declaring to the saints all the counsel of God v. 27 . While we are staying with the saints, we have to open up all the things concerning God s New Testament economy, His eternal plan.
[28]  Before writing 1 Corinthians to them, he must have definitely taught them to prophesy, to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, to speak Christ into others in their meeting.
[29]  If we do not have the assurance that one out of three that we baptize will remain, we had better baptize four, looking to the Lord that we will gain one of these for the church life.
[30]  Since we all love the Lord Jesus, love to preach the gospel, and love to see sinners get saved, we should pray for the saints who go out to visit people in their homes even though we cannot go.
[31]  In this chapter I would like to fellowship concerning how we should go on according to our present situation.
[32]  The Bible presents us with a clear picture of God s desire for the church as the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23a , the expression of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 .
[33]  The Lord Jesus told us that He would build His church upon the divine revelation of Himself as the Christ Matt 16:18 .
[34]  In His ascension He poured Himself out upon God s chosen ones to make them His Body Acts 2:2-4, 16-17a; 10:45; 1 Cor 12:13 , and He constituted some of His members as particular gifts for the building up of this Body Eph 4:8 .
[35]  We must learn from the Apostle Paul who labored day and night and who served the Lord with tears Acts 20:31, 19 .
[36]  In order to go on, we all need to drop our old concepts and pick up the new view of the Lord s present recovery.
[37]  How wonderful it is to be in the Lord s recovery, and now by His mercy we have a way to practice the church life by the preaching of the gospel, home meetings, small group meetings, and church meetings.
[38]  We do not have many verses in the Bible to tell us how to carry out the home meetings and small group meetings, but we know that we need to pray much, exercise our spirit, and release our spirit when we meet with the new ones in their homes.
[39]  If there are fifty saints in a local church, we need to look to the Lord that all of them will be occupied with some practical service to the Lord.
