<h2 class="head4">b. At a Full-grown Man</h2>
<p>Second, we arrive at the maturity of the new man. Through His death on the cross, Christ has created of the Jews and Gentiles one new man in Himself (Eph. 2:15-16). Although the new man has been created, he needs to grow unto maturity. When all the saints grow in life, the new man gradually matures.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. At the Measure of the Stature of the Fullness of Christ</h2>
<p>Third, we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23). This Body has a stature with a measure. The goal of all the saints being perfected and progressing continuously in life is that we would arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Holding to Truth That We May Grow Up<br />
into the Head, Christ, in Everything</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:15 says, &ldquo;But holding to truth in love.&rdquo; According to the whole book of Ephesians, the truth here should refer to Christ and His Body, the church. In the whole universe, only Christ and the church are real. All other things are unreal and will pass away. For this reason, we need to hold to such a reality in love. We need to love Christ and the members of His Body, not for our own interest, inclination, or goal, but in the love of Christ, who is in us, that we may grow up into the Head, Christ, in everything.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Out from the Head All the Body,<br />
Fitted and Knit Together through Every Joint<br />
of the Supply and through the Operation<br />
in Measure of Each One Part, Causing the Growth<br />
of the Body unto the Building Up of Itself in Love</h2>
<p>Our growth in life is a growth into the Head, Christ, but our function in the Body of Christ comes out from Him. First we grow into the Head. Then we have something out from the Head for the building up of His Body. Ephesians 4:16 shows us that in the Body there are the joints of supply as well as &ldquo;each one part.&rdquo; &ldquo;Every joint of the supply&rdquo; denotes the gifted ones, while &ldquo;each one part&rdquo; denotes the different members of the Body. With the joints of supply there is the rich supply of Christ, and with each one part there is the measure which comes from the growth in life and from the development of the gifts for the functioning unto the growth of the Body of Christ. Through these two groups of people, the whole Body is fitted and knit together. Being fitted is like the frame of a house being joined together, and being knit together is like the gaps in the frame being filled up with connected stones. Among us, some are the frame; their specific task is to be fitted together. Others are the stones; their specific task is to be knit together. When all the gifts and all the members are fitted and knit together in this way, the Body will grow unto the building up of itself in love.</p>
<p>Building of this kind can never be realized by having big meetings. Rather it begins with preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes. When people receive the Lord and are enlivened in their spirit, they begin to function organically. Following this, there are the home meetings, in which they are fed with spiritual milk. In this way, they will grow in life. Next, we bring them to the small group meetings, where they are enlightened, taught, and led by the light of the truth. Finally, we bring them to the larger meetings of the church, that they may receive the supply from others and may also be able to supply others. When each member of the Body of Christ is perfected one by one in this way, and when they all grow in life and function organically, the Body of Christ will be built up.</p>
<p>Once you are perfected, you should turn around to perfect other brothers and sisters in the same way by speaking to them on a one-to-one basis. If every one of our co-workers and elders faithfully fulfills their function in this way, each can help at least five to six others. As you lead these along month after month and year after year, an atmosphere will be developed among us in which every brother and sister will be perfected and will in turn perfect others. In this way, the Body of Christ will be built up through the members&rsquo; growth in life, and Ephesians chapter four and 1 Corinthians chapter fourteen will be realized among us. Only by this way can the bride be adorned and prepared to hasten and receive the Lord&rsquo;s coming. This is the Lord&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Surely He will accomplish this. May every one of us receive this serious commission from the Lord to labor diligently and to strive in oneness that the will of the Lord may be accomplished.</p>
