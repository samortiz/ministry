   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this book we want to consider one thing: how to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is nothing as vital or as basic to our Christian life and to the church life as the real, practical enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This enjoyment is not Christ in doctrine or in knowledge, but Christ in life, in the Spirit, and in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is a living Person for us to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>CHRIST THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Colossians 1:12 says, "Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the King James Version the word "portion" is translated as inheritance, but portion is the proper meaning of the Greek word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ Himself is the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has given Christ to us as a gift John 3:16 , and this gift is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After I had been a Christian for several years, I knew that Christ was my Savior Acts 5:31 , Lord Acts 2:36 , and life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, I did not realize that Christ was the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ as the portion of the saints is not so simple or small.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As our portion He is related to God, the creation, and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The new creation is the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the image of the invisible God Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is invisible John 1:18; 1 Tim 1:14-17; 6:16 , yet Christ is the image, the very expression, the explanation, and definition, of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without Him, we cannot know God or see God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is not only the image of the invisible God, but also the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that He is the first item of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the Firstborn, He has the first place, the preeminence, in all of the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 16 says, "Because in Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"In Him" means in the power of Christ's Person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All things were created in the power of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All creation bears the characteristics of Christ's intrinsic power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Through Him" indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was processed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Finally, "unto Him" indicates that Christ is the end of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All things were created for His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The entire creation now subsists together in Christ v. 17 and it will be His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The portion of the saints includes Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Colossians 1:19 reads, "For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the very embodiment of God, thus, God is embodied within Him and expressed through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At this point, we must check with ourselves: How much do we daily enjoy Christ as such a portion?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How much do we enjoy Him as a portion with God embodied in Him or as a portion with God expressed through Him?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do we enjoy Him to such an extent?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ as our portion is many other items in the book of Colossians such as the Head of the Body, the Firstborn from among the dead 1:18 , and all in all in the new man 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the Firstborn from among the dead, He is the first one resurrected from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, He is the first one in God's new creation, in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is not only the Head of the Body, but He is also everything within the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the life of the saints today and their hope of glory for the future 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Colossians 3:3 also says that our life is hidden with Christ in God.</S>
