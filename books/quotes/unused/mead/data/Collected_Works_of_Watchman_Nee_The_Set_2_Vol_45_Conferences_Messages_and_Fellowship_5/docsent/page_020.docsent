   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN TALKS 2 Date: Afternoon, November 3, 1940</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Unrecorded THE PRODUCING OF THE MAN-CHILD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The greatest work of God is the rapture of the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once the man-child is raptured to His throne, there will be war in heaven, and Satan will be cast onto the earth Rev 12:5-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If any Christian today wants to participate in this rapture, he has to be watchful and ready for the rapture by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he does, he will have a share in this greatest work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The woman in Revelation 12 represents the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In God's plan the Body spans from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It includes all the saints between the two eternities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The man-child in God's eternal plan, however, only refers to the overcomers in this period.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The giving of birth to the man-child refers to some who have left the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, not everyone who has left the denominations is part of the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only those who have left the denominations and who have seen this great work of God and have a part in it are the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The man-child is the body within the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The woman is the outward, visible, and larger Body, while the man-child that has been conceived within is something hidden, something that ordinary eyes cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is a definite number to those who are raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The man-child was born to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is very interesting!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord Jesus was born, He was "born King" Matt 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ's birth in Bethlehem was a begetting that has to do with man, whereas His resurrection from the dead was a begetting that has to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why God said, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You" Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have been on an airplane six times, and I often heard the pilots asking each other, "How high is the ceiling?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means how high are the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is the sky above the clouds and the sky under the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the pilots said that the plane was "above the ceiling" or "below the ceiling," they meant that the plane was above the clouds or below the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today some Christians are flying "above the ceiling," while others are flying "below the ceiling."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are some spiritual things which I have seen that you may not have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Or you may have seen some spiritual things that a third person has not seen or known.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The "ceiling" of some Christians today is almost as low as the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is after spiritual giants today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These "giants" are the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God desires to gain some who will be a part of the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May more people be raised up to become the man-child today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sanctification of the anointing cannot be separated from the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As soon as we have the sanctification of the anointing, we have the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who are lacking in the teaching of the anointing are surely lacking in the sanctification of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For a period of time Brother Austin-Sparks was conducting special conferences every month on Saturdays and Mondays.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One brother asked, "If this kind of conference goes on month after month, will your speaking not be exhausted?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brother Sparks answered, "If a man has the genuine experience of the cross and he knows the cross, he will not need to worry about running out of sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He will only need to worry about running out of time."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The anointing within will tell us what we should do and should not do; it will tell us if something is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If something is according to the leading of the Holy Spirit, it cannot be ambiguous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The face of the mother, whether she is smiling or frowning, is the indication for her children to know right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I believe that the Holy Spirit has been poured out, and that the Holy Spirit is in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The coming of the Spirit leads us to believe in Christ and to know that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The indwelling of the Spirit causes the believers to know all things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a believer has a problem with the anointing, it is because he has a problem with the "Holiness to Jehovah" Zech 14:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The anointing is not only an individual matter, but a corporate matter as well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every member in the church needs to maintain the proper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The word Christian means those who are anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christians are little anointed ones, those who are sanctified by the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is our position.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time, we have to walk according to the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today many people are anointed, yet they do not behave like anointed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is like Saul, who was anointed but who continued to sin and was disciplined by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The teaching of the anointing is higher than the condemnation or leading of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The conscience will either give us a sense of peace or a sense of unrest.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This sensation is based on the concept of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, when God's light comes, the inner peace that follows has nothing to do with the sense of rest or unrest in the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The conscience may condemn, while the peace within persists.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A brother did something, and his conscience condemned him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He felt sad and wrote a letter to a mature brother, relating the incident to him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After the mature one read the letter, he wrote back and brought light to the first one, who then regained his peace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The conscience can be wrong, but the teaching of the anointing can never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every person's conscience has its own standard.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We can call this the local conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, what kind of coat should a person wear?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Should he buy vegetables from the market and cook them at home?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Can he take some wine?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In these minor matters the feeling of the conscience is derived from our own understanding of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The conscience can be wrong, but the sanctification of the anointing and the teaching of the anointing can never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The garden of Eden can better be known as the age of ignorance rather than the age without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In that age there was no sanctification of the anointing or teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There was only the conscience to enable man to differentiate between right and wrong.</S>
