   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Caring for the Sense of Life and Peace</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The mind set on the spirit is life and peace Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The sense of life in us is also a sense of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we obey it, it gives us a feeling not only of life but also of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, regardless of the situation, as soon as we feel death instead of life and feel unease instead of peace, we should immediately stop what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must always care for the sense of life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would care for life and peace in this way, we must set our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only by setting the mind on the spirit can there be life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Go in peace Luke 7:50 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Luke 7, after a woman was saved, the Lord told her to go in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord s word indicates that after we are saved, we receive peace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This peace is within us and causes us to have an inward sense.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever we want to do something that pleases God, we sense peace inwardly; otherwise, we do not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we do what is in agreement with the sense of peace, we have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we do what is not in agreement with the sense of peace, we do not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we are saved, we should go the way of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After being saved, our living should be a living of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should go in peace, and we should live in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Often we do not have the sense of peace in our walk and living even though we say that we are at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just saying that we are at peace does not mean that we are at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In every single matter, we must be inwardly at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes brothers and sisters say that they have an inward peace, but their peace is not spontaneous but rather the product of their rationalization.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some brothers want to do something even though they have no inward peace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Consequently, they convince themselves that they have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Peace that comes from this kind of rationalization is not spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a peace that comes from reasoning, not a peace that comes spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As soon as they stop their reasoning, they are not peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must allow the sense of peace to work spontaneously in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Who, being past feeling,...but you did not so learn Christ Eph 4:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Gentiles have cast away all feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They commit sins and do evil without caring for their inner consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we, having learned Christ, should not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to care for the feeling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Gentiles have a conscience that is defiled and on the brink of death; they are darkened in their understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The feelings within us, however, are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The precious blood has cleansed our conscience, and because we are regenerated, our conscience has been revived.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is fresh and keen.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The understanding in our mind has been renewed and is bright and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our spirit has been made alive and has spiritual intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, we have the life of God and the Spirit of God in our spirit strengthening the feelings within us that are of life and consistent with light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we have a living, keen, rich, proper, strong, and powerful feeling that enables us to sense whether or not any matter is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As followers of Christ, we should absolutely obey and care for this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should do what this feeling approves of and wants us to do, and we should refrain from doing whatever it disagrees with and prohibits us from doing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Obeying with Fear and Trembling</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Obeyed...with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working Phil 2:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we sense God s operation in us, whether it is His willing or His working, we should obey with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Fear is our inward feeling, and trembling is our outward attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should obey because we are afraid of disobeying God, who is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we obey the inward sense, we obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should be absolute and obey with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Fellowshipping with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>according to the Teaching of the Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As His anointing teaches you...abide in Him 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The teaching of the anointing causes us to know the Lord and His life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, we should abide in the Lord and fellowship with Him according to this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To be according to the teaching of the anointing is to obey the moving of the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the only way for us to be in the Lord and to have the fellowship of life with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>THE MAINTENANCE, RECOVERY, AND INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>OF THE SENSE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order for a believer not to lose the sense of life, he must be in fear and trembling as he cares for and obeys every inward feeling of life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only this will maintain the sense of life within.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The sense of life within a believer becomes dull when he ignores or disobeys it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a believer begins to obey the small, flickering sense within, the sense of life will revive and recover.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although our sense of life sometimes becomes dull because we ignore or disobey it, it never dies out entirely or disappears completely.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Something always remains.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we are willing to care for and obey even our small sense of life, we will immediately recover.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In order to recover the sense of life, we must care for and obey it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The sense of life within a believer becomes keen when he obeys it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If a believer continues to obey everything that he feels, his sense of life will become even stronger and keener.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The more a believer obeys the sense of life, the more the sense of life increases.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, our obedience increases the sense of life within us.</S>
