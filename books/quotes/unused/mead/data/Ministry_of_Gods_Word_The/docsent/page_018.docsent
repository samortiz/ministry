   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me repeat: other than the mystery of the Body of Christ, which is composed of Jews and Gentiles, and which is depicted in Ephesians, the New Testament contains nothing new.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everything in the New Testament is a further development of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The basic principle to remember is that God s light is contained in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to learn to serve the Lord and be a minister of His word, we have to learn to know His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not everyone who is familiar with the Bible can serve as a minister of the word, but those who are not familiar with the Bible will have less of a chance to become a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot be lazy in our knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to know the Bible, there is the need for spiritual familiarization.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not enough just to memorize or read through the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must read it before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need the light, and it must become a shining book to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to study the words contained in this book in the presence of God, and we have to allow these previously spoken words to speak to us once again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a man has never touched God s word in the Bible, he can never touch God s light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The present-day word is contained in the New Testament words, just as the New Testament words are contained in the Old Testament words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to realize that just as Paul and the other apostles derived their speakings from Moses and the prophets, we also derive our speaking from Paul and the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to learn to receive a further word through receiving the apostles words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the revelations we have today represent further light upon previously spoken words.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first time God spoke, He spoke directly to men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since that time, we receive further words through existing words; our words are built upon existing words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The basic principle today is to receive the word through the Word and to build words upon the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not receive God s word independently or autonomously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do not receive our word from existing words, we are not qualified to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should go to God s Word according to the pattern of the apostles, not according to the fashion of the scribes and Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should all find light from the Word and produce more words from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first grain of wheat was created by God, but all subsequent grains are begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One grain begets many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From the one grain, many grains are produced, and many grains bring in many more grains.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first grain was from God; it was created.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was not preceded by anything; it was unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s word works according to the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first word was created by God; it was unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From this word more advancements were made and more words were spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first word God spoke was unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today this word in us has produced more words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once we have the established word in us, more words are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Each generation finds the word becoming clearer and more abundant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today we cannot expect God to create a grain from nothing and then to sow with such a grain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same way, we cannot expect God to create a word out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can only receive words that are based on God s established words; we can only receive light that is based upon existing light and revelation that is based upon existing revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the way of the ministers of the word today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If anyone goes beyond this limit, he is a heretic.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, do not allow anyone to lightly claim that he is an apostle or a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a man goes beyond the boundary of God s established, spoken Word in his speaking, his speaking is heretical and devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a man is not careful with his speaking, he will get into great trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today light is contained in the previously received light, the word is contained in the Word, and revelation is contained in the past revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Anything that comes from the Bible is right; anything that does not come from the Bible, but from other sources, is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the speakings we have today come from past speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today is not the day of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today s principle is the principle of begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Revelation begets revelation, light begets light, and word begets word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today we are learning to speak step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually, we hope that we will have the ministry of the word.</S>
