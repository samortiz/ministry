   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DRUNK WITH THE BLOOD OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 17:6 says, "And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a gruesome thing to drink human blood until one is drunk, but this is the very characteristic of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is extreme cruelty in the Catholic Church; it is willing to resort to any means to annihilate genuine believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord charges us only to bless, not to curse.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the Roman Catholic Church is full of curses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It pronounces anathemas on all kinds of beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It considers all believers of heresies to be accursed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When it calls someone a heretic, it means he is a believer of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the Council of Trent one archbishop stood up and said, "We anathematize everything that is different from us."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the other bishops echoed by saying, "Let it be accursed!"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They did this at the end of every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What a pitiful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Luke 9 says that as the days were being fulfilled for Jesus to be taken up, He steadfastly set His face toward Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When they reached a village in Samaria, the people there did not receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>James and John, His two disciples saw this, and they said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord said, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>51-55 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means they did not know what they were saying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the disciples saw evidences of persecution, their spirits reacted strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They wanted to curse, but the Lord stopped them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With the Roman Catholic Church, however, every Thursday evening the pope reads twenty-seven anathemas.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything that is different from Catholicism is anathematized.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These twenty-seven anathemas are further divided into finer points.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in reality there are more than twenty-seven clauses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the pronouncement, the anathemas are set on fire, and the fire is cast into the earth with the words: "To die eternally, as this fire."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fulota ? said that the end of those who believe in heresy is death, while Kerdiluma ? said, "We will never have mercy on those who hold different beliefs than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to try them and consider them as Sin incarnated."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before the Reformation, there was the Inquisition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Countless numbers of people from many countries died under its hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those taken before the Inquisition were subjected to all kinds of torture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Catholics thought that pain was the only way to recover these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They erected many gallows and wrenched the tormented ones with ropes until all the bones in their bodies were broken.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes they nailed men's feet to the floor, hung their upper bodies from the beams, and then wrung them with ropes until all their bones were dislocated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At other times they poured boiling oil into men's mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can never imagine the cruelty our brothers in ancient days suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE PERSECUTION IN MADRID</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Madrid during the first twelve months of the persecution, 10,220 people died.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time the church did not kill anyone; it merely ordered the local government to execute the killing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thomas Aquinas believed that the church had the authority to hang the heretics and put them to death in order to preserve the purity of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He said, "On the one hand we must not tolerate the heretics, and they should receive just recompense for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we should also be merciful to them and exhort them twice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps they can be brought back to the faith of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If after the second admonition they still persist in their errors, they must not only be excommunicated but must be destroyed by handing them over to the secular officers."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church would not execute the murder; it handed the job to local officials.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Roman Catholic Church openly claims that the words of Aquinas are the direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the time of Martin Luther, all the bishops had to swear to do their best to persecute those who held different beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the bishops had to make such a vow before the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Roman Catholic Church canon law says that five popes have ordered the secular rulers of all countries to destroy those who hold different beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1872 the London Times reported that the Roman Catholic Church believed that anyone who killed under the instruction of a priest was not considered a murderer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On July 13, 1895, the same newspaper reported a speech by the pope in which he said that it was a good deed to kill a Protestant.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such an act could absolve the murderer of the sin of killing a Catholic.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Catholic Church set up cellars in Madrid, in which they packed men with dissenting beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some had just died, while others could only be identified by their skeletons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There were young men and women, as well as old people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some were chained in complete nakedness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Within the cells were all kinds of torture instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One of the great and spacious halls there was filled with human bones.</S>
