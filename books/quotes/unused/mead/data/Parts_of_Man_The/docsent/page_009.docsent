   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL DEALING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some are always in the mind, some are too emotional, and some have a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We try to stop, but we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then what can the Lord do?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The only way is for Him to put us into certain circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you are a man who is very much in the mind, the Lord will bring you into a set of circumstances in which your mind will involve you in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He will put you into a certain kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you are a man with a strong will and none can subdue you, the Lord will place you in a certain kind of circumstance to make you suffer long.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your strong will, month by month and year by year, will be broken and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapters three and four of 2 Corinthians there are two main points.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapter three says that we are transformed into the image of Christ from glory to glory by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the next chapter tells of all manner of sufferings and circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord comes in to put us into certain situations in order to smash us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have never known any brother or sister who really loved the Lord and yet never experienced any suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the seeking ones who love the Lord always have some manner of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a brother is clever in his mentality, the Lord will put him into some perplexing circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One day, he will finally say, "O Lord, no one is as foolish as I!"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before this he always thought he was quite clever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But after a certain amount of suffering, he has been subdued; he admits that he is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Henceforth, he will fear his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You need not tell him to stop; he will stop automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has been stopped once for all through the Lord's working in outward circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is now the mark of brokenness in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some years ago I met a very good sister who was full of natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the Lord sent a certain amount of suffering into her life because of her natural love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For years she was afflicted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After considerable time, she came to the point where she hated to use her emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There was no need to tell her to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From that time, whenever she loved others, the sense of Christ was in her love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She had been transformed from her natural love into the love of Christ, which had been wrought into her by the transforming Spirit through her suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The breaking of our natural soul-life is a lesson which many saints must learn in a hard way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In some cases, it is easy to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need only realize that the Lord is within as life and learn to check ourself by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some learn this lesson without much difficulty, but for a great number of brothers and sisters it is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They must experience much trouble and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some are dealt with for five years, some for ten, and others even longer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All kinds of suffering are brought to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But they are not to be pitied.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are in the hands of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their "outward man is consumed, yet the inward is renewed" 2 Cor 4:16, Darby's New Translation .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you meet them after two or three years of the Lord's dealing, more of Christ is within them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After another two or three years, even more of Christ will be within them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not mean that they will say more about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They may not say anything about Christ, but the reality and sense of Christ will be within them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have heard some talk much about Christ, but the more they talked, the less they had of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not a matter of talking about Christ, but of having Christ wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you have learned the lesson of being broken, the riches of Christ will be wrought into you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When others meet you, they will sense the fullness and the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The natural being has been transformed into the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ will not only be what you speak, but He will also be the very element of your mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The substance of Christ will be in your thinking, in your loving, and in your choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There will be a sense of Christ in whatever you are and do.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You have been transformed into the image of Christ through the work of breaking in sufferings.</S>
