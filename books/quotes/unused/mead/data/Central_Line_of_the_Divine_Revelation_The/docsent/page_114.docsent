   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the Strengthening of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That Christ May Make His Home in Our Hearts</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That We May Be Filled unto All the Fullness of God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is also by the strengthening of the Spirit that Christ may make His home in our hearts that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God Eph 3:16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The indwelling Spirit is always within us to strengthen us that Christ may make His home in our hearts that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many Christians know nothing concerning Christ's making His home in our hearts, but I am confident that most of the saints in the Lord's recovery do know something concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we should take the opportunity to speak to others concerning this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>19.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By Holding the Head</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That We May Grow into Him in Everything</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>for the Building Up of His Body</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We receive, experience, and enjoy Christ also by holding the Head that we may grow into Him in everything for the building up of His Body Eph 4:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To understand any portion of the Bible we must take care of its context.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The meaning of holding the Head in Ephesians 4:15 is found in verses 13 through 16.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to read these verses again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One item mentioned in these verses is the winds of teaching v. 14 . While we are in the recovery growing in Christ, the winds of teaching often come.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the past several years the winds came a number of times, and some of the weaker ones have been blown away; that is, they have left the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To hold the Head is to hold on to Christ as our centrality, universality, and everything and not listen to the heretical, distracting teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>20.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By Being Renewed in the Spirit of the Mind</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>for the Putting On of the New Man</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is also by being renewed in the spirit of the mind for the putting on of the new man Eph 4:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a faculty of our being, our mind can be empty or it can be filled with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If our spirit is strong, it will invade and occupy our mind, causing our mind to be full of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our mind must be under the control of our spirit, and our spirit must be in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spirit that is in our mind renews us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is one of the ways to experience Christ as revealed in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Being renewed in the spirit of the mind is for the putting on of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are in the process of putting off the old man as our old "garment" and putting on the new man, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many Christians today are "naked" because they do not have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For many saints, talking too long on the telephone is the old garment, the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must put off the old garment, the old daily habits, and endeavor to put on more of the new man every day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By being renewed in this way we enjoy Christ.</S>
