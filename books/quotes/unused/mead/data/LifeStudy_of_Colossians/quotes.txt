[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE ONE THE BACKGROUND AND POSITION OF THE BOOK
[2]  In the book of Colossians Christ is unveiled to a fuller extent than in any other book in the Bible.
[3]  In this short book many terms and expressions are used to describe Christ.
[4]  Before we consider the revelation of Christ in Colossians, we need to pay attention to the background and position of this book, both of which are crucial.
[5]  The constituent of the church should be Christ and Christ alone, for the church is the Body of Christ.
[6]  In Galatians Paul speaks of Christ being revealed in us, of Christ living in us, and of Christ being formed in us.
[7]  Colossians 1:1-8 is the introduction to this Epistle.
[8]  Faith is to realize and receive what is in Christ, love is to experience and enjoy what we have received of Christ, and hope is to expect and wait for the glorification in Christ.
[9]  The reason we can love those whom we could never love naturally is that hope is being laid up for us in the heavens.
[10]  In 1:5 Paul goes on to say of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel.
[11]  In our preaching of the gospel there must be not only the word of the gospel, but also the truth of the gospel, which is Christ Himself.
[12]  A minister of Christ is not only a servant of Christ who serves Christ, but a serving one who serves others with Christ by ministering Christ to them.
[13]  The subject of the book of Colossians is the all-inclusive Christ.
[14]  In his introductory word 1:1-8 Paul indicates that Christ is our hope, reality, and grace.
[15]  In his prayer and thanksgiving 1:9-14 he gives further indications that Christ is the all-inclusive One.
[16]  God s will for the Colossians was to know Christ, to experience Christ, to enjoy Christ, to live Christ, and to have Christ become their life and their person.
[17]  In verse 10 Paul says, To walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work and growing by the full knowledge of God.
[18]  Walking worthily of the Lord results from the full knowledge of God s will.
[19]  If we know that God s will is for us to be saturated with Christ, to take Christ as our life and our person, and to live Christ, spontaneously our walk will be worthy of the Lord.
[20]  The most pleasant thing is to live Christ, to enjoy Christ, and to experience Christ.
[21]  Bearing fruit here refers to living Christ, growing Christ, expressing Christ, and producing Christ in every respect.
[22]  For Christ to be the Head of the Body, and for us, His believers, to be the members of His Body, He needed to deliver us out of the authority of darkness, the kingdom of Satan Matt 12:26 , and transfer us into the kingdom of Christ, the kingdom of God s Beloved.
[23]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FOUR DELIVERED OUT OF THE AUTHORITY OF DARKNESS
[24]  We have been delivered from the Devil, Satan, by the death of Christ Col 2:15 and by the life of Christ in resurrection John 5:24 .
[25]  With this as the background, we need to see that Christ is the preeminent and all-inclusive One, the centrality and universality of God.
[26]  I. CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS A. Incarnated to Put On the Old Creation
[27]  Let us now, in the way of an overall survey, look at Christ in the Gospels, in the Acts, in the Epistles, in Revelation, and then in Colossians.
[28]  In the Gospels we see that Christ was incarnated to put on the old creation.
[29]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE SIX CHRIST THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS Scripture Reading: Col 1:12-14; Gen 12:2b, 3b, 7; Gal 3:14
[30]  In this message we shall consider Christ as the portion of the saints.
[31]  Before Paul wrote Colossians, he wrote the Epistle to the Galatians.
[32]  As the good land is an all-inclusive type of Christ, and as Christ has become the Spirit, so the Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit as the processed God, is eventually the good land to us, the New Testament believers, as a fulfillment of God s promise to Abraham that all the nations of the earth would be blessed in him Gen 12:3 .
[33]  In writing 1 Corinthians Paul also used pictures from the Old Testament.
[34]  In 1 Corinthians 5:7 we see that Christ is the Passover, and in 10:3 and 4, that He is the manna.
[35]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE SEVEN PARTAKING OF CHRIST IN THE LIGHT Scripture Reading: Col 1:12-13; Gen 1:3; Psa 36:9; 119:105; Isa 2:5; Matt 4:16; John 1:4; Acts 26:18; 1 John 1:5; Rev 21:23
[36]  In 1:12 Paul says that the Father has qualified us for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.
[37]  Christ, our portion, is to be enjoyed by us in the light.
[38]  The Bible reveals that the light is related to God, the Word of God, Christ, the life of Christ, the believers, and the church.
[39]  LIFE STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE EIGHT CHRIST THE FIRSTBORN OF ALL CREATION Scripture Reading: Col 1:15-17; Rev 3:14
[40]  In this message we shall consider what it means for Christ to be the firstborn of all creation 1:15-17 .
[41]  The main purpose of the book of Colossians is to show that Christ is everything, that He is all.
[42]  In order to show us that Christ is all, the Bible tells us that Christ is both the Creator and the firstborn of all creation.
[43]  Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God.
[44]  When we see Christ, we see the expression of the invisible God, for He Himself is God.
[45]  In a previous message I pointed out that in 1934 Brother Nee gave a series of messages in Shanghai on the centrality and universality of Christ.
[46]  When this material was translated into English, the translator took the liberty of interpreting Brother Nee s concept regarding Christ as the first of the creatures in a way to which Brother Nee would never have agreed.
[47]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE NINE CHRIST FIRSTBORN FROM AMONG THE DEAD Scripture Reading: Col 1:18-23
[48]  We have seen that the book of Colossians reveals that Christ is everything.
[49]  Christology is the theological study of the Person of Christ.
[50]  Some teach the truth that Christ is both God and man.
[51]  Others, however, teach that Christ is God, but not man or that He is man, but not God.
[52]  In this Epistle Paul seemed to be telling the Colossians, Why are you so foolish?
[53]  You have received Christ, the One who is everything.
[54]  If Christ is infused into you, you will drop everything that is not Christ, and you will be constituted with Christ in your very being.
[55]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE TEN CHRIST S RELATIONSHIP TO CREATION Scripture Reading: Col 1:15-19 THE MEANS OF CREATION
[56]  In the traditional teaching prevailing in Christianity, Christ is considered to be the Creator.
[57]  Although as God Christ is the Creator, no verse in the Bible says explicitly that Christ created the heavens, the earth, and all the things in the universe.
[58]  Hence, this verse does not say that all things were created by Christ, but that all things came into existence through Christ.
[59]  Christ is related to creation in a subjective way.
[60]  Christ did not create the universe merely in an objective way as an objective Creator.
[61]  Because all things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ and because all things subsist in Christ, God can be expressed in creation through Christ who is the image of the invisible God.
[62]  THE EXPRESSION OF GOD IN ALL HIS RICH BEING
[63]  The rich being of God is expressed both in the old creation and in the new creation through Christ as the One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things came into being and as the One in whom all things subsist.
[64]  As God Christ is the Creator, but as Christ He is the instrument, the means, of creation.
[65]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE ELEVEN THE STEWARDSHIP OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 1:24-26
[66]  In 1:25 Paul says that he became a minister according to the stewardship of God.
[67]  In 1:24 Paul says, Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.
[68]  The afflictions of Christ are of two categories: those for accomplishing redemption, which have been completed by Christ Himself; and those for producing and building the church, which need to be filled up by the apostles and the believers.
[69]  This concealed mystery, which has been made manifest to God s saints, is Christ in you, the hope of glory v. 27 . Although I have heard the preaching of the gospel for years, I have rarely heard a message saying that when someone believes in Jesus Christ, Christ will not only save him, but also come into his spirit and remain there as his life.
[70]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE TWELVE FILLING UP WHAT IS LACKING
[71]  OF THE AFFLICTIONS OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:24; 1 Pet 3:18; Heb 9:26; Isa 53:3-5, 7-8; John 12:24; Luke 12:50; Phil 3:10; Rev 1:9; 2 Tim 2:10; 2 Cor 1:5-6
[72]  In Revelation 1:9 John says that he was a joint partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.
[73]  To say that we are joint partakers in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus indicates that we are suffering.
[74]  We need to follow the early apostles in making up the lack of Christ s afflictions for the church.
[75]  We also need to share in the fellowship of Christ s sufferings for the building up of the church.
[76]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN COMPLETING THE WORD OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 1:25; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; 13:14; Eph 3:14-19
[77]  In this message we shall consider the matter of completing the word of God.
[78]  Paul was also given the revelation concerning the dispensation of God 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 3:14-19 .
[79]  These rumors show that Satan attacks those today who stand for the revelation given by God to Paul, in particular for the revelation concerning Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.
[80]  In 1:25 Paul speaks of the stewardship of God.
[81]  As the mystery of Christ, the church is the Body of Christ, His fullness, and the new man to be the full expression of Christ as well.
[82]  Let us now pay closer attention to the riches of the glory of the mystery spoken of in verse 27.
[83]  The riches of this mystery among the nations are the riches of all that Christ is to the Gentile believers Eph 3:8 .
[84]  In verse 27 Paul says that Christ in us is the hope of glory.
[85]  Christ is the mystery which is full of glory now.
[86]  This glory will be manifested to its fullest extent when Christ returns to glorify His saints Rom 8:30 .
[87]  Today we may live in Christ, by Christ, and with Christ.
[88]  Here Paul does not say that he taught Christ or preached Christ, but that he announced Christ.
[89]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FIFTEEN CHRIST IN YOU THE HOPE OF GLORY Scripture Reading: Col 1:26-27, 12, 15, 18-19; 2:2, 9, 16-17; 3:11; John 14:17, 20; 1 Cor 15:45b; Phil 1:19; 2 Tim 4:22; 1 Cor 6:17; Col 3:4; Eph 3:17a; Rom 8:23; Phil 3:21; 2 Thes 1:10a
[90]  In the foregoing message we saw that Christ is the mystery of God s economy.
[91]  In this message we shall go on to see that Christ in us is the hope of glory.
[92]  In order to be impressed with this aspect of Christ, we need to pay attention to a number of crucial points regarding Christ that are covered in Colossians.
[93]  Colossians 1:19 says that all the fullness was pleased to dwell in Christ.
[94]  Many Christians speak of the indwelling Christ without realizing that the Christ who indwells them is the all-inclusive One.
[95]  If some were asked what kind of Christ lives in them, they would speak only of Christ as the Savior and the Redeemer.
[96]  When Paul says, Christ in you, the hope of glory 1:27 , he is referring to a very rich Christ, to the Christ who is our good land, the expression of the invisible God, the firstborn of both the old creation and the new creation, and the One in whom all the fullness is pleased to dwell.
[97]  In 3:10 and 11 Paul speaks of the new man, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.
[98]  This indicates that Christ is the constituent of the new man.
[99]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE SIXTEEN PRESENTING EVERY MAN FULL-GROWN IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:25-28; 2:4, 9; 3:4a; Eph 3:8-11, 4; 1:23; John 6:57b; 14:19b; Gal 2:20a; Eph 4:15, 13b
[100]  Speaking of Christ who dwells in us as the hope of glory, Paul says in 1:28, Whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ.
[101]  Paul s ministry was to impart Christ to others so that they may be perfect and complete by maturing in Christ unto full growth.
[102]  As we preach the gospel to unbelievers, minister Christ to them, and help them to receive the Lord, our goal is not merely that they should be saved from the lake of fire and from God s condemnation.
[103]  Our goal is not only for them to experience God s forgiveness; it is to minister Christ into them so that they may eventually be presented full-grown in Christ.
[104]  But if in our daily living we live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ, we shall spontaneously infuse Christ into others as we contact them.
[105]  Secondly, to present every man full-grown in Christ, we need to minister the unsearchable riches of Christ for the building up of the church to fulfill God s eternal purpose Eph 3:8-11 .
[106]  If we would present others mature in Christ, we must minister the church as the mystery of Christ, as the ex- pension of Christ Eph 3:4; 1:23 .
[107]  TO THE OPERATION OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:28-29; 2:1-2; Eph 3:20; 1:19-22
[108]  In this message we shall consider the matter of struggling according to the operation of Christ 1:29 .
[109]  We have pointed out that Paul labored to present every man full-grown in Christ.
[110]  Presenting others full-grown in Christ is a very difficult task, a task which can be accomplished only by struggling according to Christ s operation.
[111]  Applying this principle to the matter of presenting every man full-grown in Christ, we see that we should not merely pray, but also labor according to Christ s operation.
[112]  In this verse Paul deals with two crucial organs of our inner being: the heart and the mind.
[113]  When the mind is in such a condition, it cannot understand the word that is ministered concerning Christ and God s economy.
[114]  Only after their hearts had been comforted could the Colossians receive the revelation concerning Christ.
[115]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN CHRIST THE MYSTERY OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 2:2-3, 9; 1:19
[116]  The book of Ephesians is on the mystery of Christ, which is the church, the Body Eph 3:4 .
[117]  It is crucial that we know Christ not only as our Savior and Lord, but also as the mystery of God.
[118]  In 2:2 Paul goes on to speak of all the riches of the full assurance of understanding.
[119]  The comforting of the heart must have a result.
[120]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE NINETEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST
[121]  In this message we come to the matter of the experience of Christ as the mystery of God.
[122]  We shall consider a number of points which help us experience Christ in this way.
[123]  If we are distracted from Christ and turn our attention to things that replace Him, our faith will be weakened, perhaps even shaken.
[124]  In the previous message we spoke about experiencing Christ as the mystery of God.
[125]  Now we shall go on to consider how to walk in such a Christ.
[126]  To walk in Christ as the mystery of God is to live, act, behave, and have our being in Him.
[127]  In this chapter Paul also shows that Christ is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, the Head of the Body, the firstborn from among the dead, and the One in whom all the fullness is pleased to dwell.
[128]  This Christ, the mystery of God, is the One in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden v. 3 . Furthermore, He is the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily 2:9 . Once the Colossians had the full assurance of understanding concerning the all-inclusive Christ, they could then walk in Him.
[129]  If we would walk in Christ as the mystery of God, we must see that, according to Paul s concept, the Christ in whom we are to walk is the good land.
[130]  On the one hand, the good land is revealed in the Old Testament.
[131]  As the Lord s children, supplied by His mercy and grace, delved into the Word, they began to realize that the good land promised by God to His chosen people is a type of Christ.
[132]  If the Passover enjoyed in Egypt and the manna experienced in the wilderness were types of Christ, then the good land must also be a type of Christ.
[133]  We need to be deeply impressed that this good land typifies the all-inclusive Christ.
[134]  We have pointed out that in Colossians 2:7 Paul says that we have been rooted in Christ.
[135]  If we have been rooted in Christ, then He must be our soil, our earth.
[136]  Have you ever realized that Christ is the very land in which you are rooted, that you are a plant rooted in Christ as the soil?
[137]  AND CARRIED OFF FROM CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 2:4, 8
[138]  According to typology, the children of Israel enjoyed Christ in three stages: in Egypt, in the wilderness, and in the good land.
[139]  God s purpose is fulfilled neither by the enjoyment of Christ as the Passover lamb in Egypt nor by the enjoyment of Christ as manna in the wilderness.
[140]  In verse 4 Paul specifically refers to persuasive speech.
[141]  The philosophy and empty deceit are not only according to the tradition of men, but also according to the elements of the world.
[142]  To fall short of being according to Christ, firstly means that we do not take Christ as life 3:4 .
[143]  Furthermore, it is not to know Christ as the mystery of God 2:2 , nor to experience the indwelling Christ as the hope of glory 1:27 .
[144]  If we take Christ as life, hold Him as the Head of the Body, know Him as the mystery of God, experience Him as the hope of glory, and walk in Him as the all-inclusive Spirit, then we shall not be deceived by anything or by anyone.
[145]  They did not realize that Christ alone is everything in God s economy, and they did not take Christ as their life or as their Head.
[146]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO MADE FULL AND CIRCUMCISED IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 2:9-12, 18, 20-22; 1 Cor 1:30; Eph 3:8
[147]  After warning us to beware that no one carries us off as spoil through philosophy and empty deceit, Paul tells us that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily 2:9 .
[148]  Then in verse 10 he goes on to say, And you in Him are made full, Who is the Head of all rule and authority.
[149]  In Christ we lack nothing, for in Him we have been perfected and completed.
[150]  This means that Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, that the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Christ in a bodily form.
[151]  In 2:10 Paul says that Christ is the Head of all rule and authority.
[152]  B. In the Putting Off of the Body of the Flesh
[153]  The circumcision that took place by the death of Christ and is applied by the powerful Spirit accomplishes the putting off of the body of the flesh.
[154]  Paul s concept in Colossians 2 was that since the believers in Christ had been circumcised in the circumcision of Christ, which was accomplished by Christ s death and is applied by the Spirit, and since this is the circumcision in which they have been buried and terminated, there is absolutely no need for the practice of asceticism.
[155]  As we shall see, this economy involves three things: making us alive with Christ, abolishing the ritual law, and stripping off the evil angelic powers.
[156]  By mentioning the enlivening of those who are dead in offenses together with the ordinances of the law and the angels, Paul s intention is to point out that the concept held by the Colossians was altogether wrong.
[157]  Colossians 2:15 portrays the fighting that took place at the time of Christ s crucifixion.
[158]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR CHRIST THE BODY OF ALL THE SHADOWS Scripture Reading: Col 2:16-18, 20-22
[159]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that in the economy of His salvation God has enlivened us, has nailed the law to the cross, and has stripped off the rulers and authorities.
[160]  According to Paul s word in 2:14, the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us and contrary to us, has been taken out of the way.
[161]  In this message we need to consider how Christ is the body of all the shadows.
[162]  In 2:16 and 17 Paul says, Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.
[163]  Although Colossians is a short book, different parts of it are written from different directions, from different points of view.
[164]  In like manner, we insult Him if we respect physical or material things more than Christ, for all such things are shadows of Christ.
[165]  In 2:18 Paul issues a warning to the believers at Colosse: Let no one purposely defraud you of your prize, in humility and worship of the angels, standing on things which he has seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh.
[166]  THE HERESY OF MYSTICISM A. Teaching Self-abasing Humility
[167]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST S DEATH
[168]  VERSUS ASCETICISM Scripture Reading: Col 2:20-23 ONE PERSON AND ONE WAY
[169]  In His economy God gives us one Person and one way.
[170]  The one Person is the preeminent, all-inclusive Christ, and the one way is the cross.
[171]  In 2:20 Paul points out that we have died with Christ from the elements of the world.
[172]  Let us now look at 2:20-23 in more detail.
[173]  At the beginning of this message I would like to give a further word on the way of the cross.
[174]  According to the New Testament, Christ has had two births.
[175]  Furthermore, when we open to the Spirit and allow Him to apply the death of Christ to our situation, this experience of Christ s death will bring Christ to us in resurrection.
[176]  In 3:1 Paul says, If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.
[177]  As those who have died with Christ from the things on the earth, especially to things related to asceticism, as those who have been baptized into His death Rom 6:3 , and who have been raised together with Christ, we should live in the heavens.
[178]  Because our life not our natural life, but our spiritual life, which is Christ has been hidden with Christ in God, who is in the heavens, we should no longer care for things on the earth.
[179]  We have died with Christ, we have been raised with Christ, and we are hidden in God with Christ.
[180]  In verses 1 and 3 we have a matter that deserves our attention.
[181]  In verse 1 we are told that Christ is at the right hand of God.
[182]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT CHRIST THE CONSTITUENT OF THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Col 3:5-11; Gal 2:20a; Rom 6:3; 8:13; Eph 4:22, 25a, 24; Rom 12:2; Phil 1:21; Col 1:27; 1 Cor 12:13
[183]  According to Colossians 3, Christ is our life and the One who is all and in all vv.
[184]  The problem with the believers in Colosse was not with the spirit, nor with the new creation.
[185]  Because they had accepted various philosophies, their problem was in the mind.
[186]  In verse 11 Paul goes on to say, Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.
[187]  After giving an introductory word in 1:1-8, the book of Colossians unveils Christ as the preeminent and all-inclusive One, as the centrality and universality of God 1:9 3:11 .
[188]  As we consider all these aspects of Christ, we shall realize that the revelation of Christ conveyed in Colossians is extraordinary, absolutely different from what is revealed elsewhere in the Scriptures.
[189]  To live in union with Christ means that in our living we are not apart from Christ.
[190]  To say that Christ is all and in all in the new man indicates that we are one with Christ and that Christ is one with us.
[191]  Concerning our living in union with Christ, Paul tells us to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts and to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly.
[192]  Before we consider verses 15 through 17 in more detail, let us look at certain aspects of verses 12 through 14.
[193]  In verse 12 Paul says, Put on therefore as God s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering; bearing one another and forgiving one another, if anyone should have a complaint against any; as the Lord forgave you, so also should you forgive.
[194]  After Paul wrote concerning the all-inclusive Christ and concerning the new man in whom Christ is all and in all and where there is no room for Greek, Jew, or other cultural distinctions, he charged the saints to care for the peace of Christ.
[195]  In verse 16 Paul goes on to say, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.
[196]  The word of Christ is the word spoken by Christ.
[197]  Now we need to be filled with Christ, saturated with Christ, and permeated with Christ until Christ becomes us.
[198]  In Colossians the emphasis is that we should hold Christ as our Head and take Him as our life by having His rich word dwelling in us, that the highest ethical relationships, issuing not from our natural life but from Christ as our life, may be realized for His expression.
[199]  In 4:5 and 6 Paul says, Walk in wisdom toward those who are without, redeeming the time.
[200]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE CONCLUSION Scripture Reading: Col 4:7-18
[201]  As we read through these eleven verses, we find that they are a detailed portrait of the new man living in the Mediterranean area.
[202]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO LIVING CHRIST AS THE CONSTITUENT
[203]  OF THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Col 3:4, 10-15; 1:25-27
[204]  The second section 1:9 3:11 is focused on Christ as the preeminent and all-inclusive One, the centrality and universality of God.
[205]  In 1:9 3:11 we see seven major aspects of Christ: that Christ is the portion of the saints 1:9-14 , that He is the first both in creation and in resurrection 1:15-23 , that He is the mystery of God s economy 1:24-29 , that He is the mystery of God 2:1-7 , that He is the body of all the shadows 2:8-23 , that He is the life of the saints 3:1-4 , and that He is the constituent of the new man 3:5-11 .
[206]  To say that the enjoyment of Christ as the portion of the saints results in the experience of Christ as the constituent of the new man indicates that the enjoyment of Christ results in the church life.
[207]  If we would live Christ as the constituent of the new man, we need to be ruled by the peace of Christ 3:12-15 and inhabited by the word of Christ 3:16-17 .
[208]  We also need to allow the word of Christ to inhabit us, to dwell in us, to make home in us.
[209]  We must be willing to set aside our concepts, our opinions, and give place to the word of Christ.
[210]  If we want the word of Christ to inhabit us, we need to empty our entire inner being.
[211]  All of our inward parts our mind, emotion, will, heart, and spirit must be empty, available to be filled with the word of Christ.
[212]  If we would live Christ as the constituent of the new man, the peace of Christ must be the arbitrator in our heart, and the word of Christ must be the content of our inner being.
[213]  We pray that all the saints in the Lord s recovery will give place to the arbitrating peace of Christ and to the inhabiting word of Christ.
[214]  The problem in Colosse was not sinfulness, as in Corinth; it was culture.
[215]  If we get into the depths of the book of Colossians, we shall see that it deals not with sin or with the law, but with man s culture.
[216]  We have pointed out again and again that after Paul tells us that Christ is our life and the constituent of the new man, he charges us to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in us and to let the word of Christ inhabit us.
[217]  According to 3:11, in the new man there is no possibility for the various cultural distinctions to continue to exist.
[218]  Here there is no longer the distinction between the cultured and the uncultured, for in the new man Christ is all and in all.
[219]  After speaking of this, Paul goes on to charge us, who come from many different backgrounds, to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts.
[220]  In this message we shall consider the all-inclusive Christ as revealed in Colossians.
[221]  Most of the saints in the Lord s recovery are familiar with this term, the all-inclusive Christ.
[222]  In various messages we have emphasized that the Christ in the book of Colossians is the all-inclusive One.
[223]  Through the fall of man, certain negative things have come in to interfere with Christ being for the church.
[224]  The church life, however, should be absolutely in Christ, with Christ, of Christ, by Christ, and for Christ.
[225]  As a result, the church is no longer purely in Christ, of Christ, with Christ, by Christ, and for Christ.
[226]  We shall realize that all material things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ and that they all subsist in Christ for the purpose that God may be expressed.
[227]  God has two creations: the old creation and the new creation.
[228]  Here we are told that Christ is the beginning, firstborn from among the dead.
[229]  Christ is the Head of the Body, the church, which is God s new creation.
[230]  If the old creation is in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ and subsists together in Christ, so the new creation is all the more.
[231]  In the church we are in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ, and we subsist in Christ to be God s expression in Christ.
[232]  The church was created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ, and the church subsists in Christ who is the very image of God.
[233]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Col 2:2-4, 6-10, 16-22; 3:4, 10-11, 15-16
[234]  In 2:3 Paul tells us that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ.
[235]  In verse 8 Paul says, Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.
[236]  Paul wrote this Epistle because the tradition of men, the elements of the world, were prevailing in Colosse.
[237]  After Paul points out in chapter one that Christ is the firstborn of all creation, that all things were created in Him, through Him, and unto Him, and that all things subsist in Him, he tells us that the all-inclusive Christ is the mystery of God s economy.
[238]  In 2:2 Paul goes on to say that Christ is the mystery of God.
[239]  Embodied in Christ is all that God is and has.
[240]  As the mystery of God, Christ is the embodiment, definition, and explanation of God.
[241]  We need to be those who are filled with Christ, saturated with Christ, clothed with Christ, and fully taken over by Christ.
[242]  If we all exercise to live by Christ day by day, we shall live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ.
[243]  In 2:7 Paul speaks of being rooted in Christ.
[244]  We are plants rooted in Christ as the real soil.
[245]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST VERSUS CULTURE Scripture Reading: Col 1:27-28; 2:2b-4, 6, 8-9, 16-19; 3:3-4, 9b-11
[246]  It is difficult to speak concerning Christ versus culture, for there is the danger of understanding such a word according to the natural concept.
[247]  In saying that Christ is versus culture, we are not saying that we should drop our culture and then live without any culture whatever.
[248]  Concerning this matter of the all-inclusive Christ versus culture, we need to see that according to the full revelation in the Bible God s intention is to work Himself into His chosen people.
[249]  Instead, testify to others that you have received Christ and that now you are living Christ, growing Christ, and producing Christ.
[250]  However, we should not endeavor to drop our culture without such a vision of Christ.
[251]  But as soon as the vision comes, we must set aside our cultural background and not allow it to replace Christ or to restrict Him.
[252]  The point we are making is that since we have received Christ, we should not allow culture to become a substitute for Him.
[253]  I believe that the time is right for messages on Christ versus culture to be released.
[254]  It is vital for us all to see a vision concerning the all-inclusiveness of Christ.
[255]  Christ must become everything to us in our daily living.
[256]  The Christ who indwells us is not a small, limited Christ.
[257]  There is no need for us to make up our minds to live a certain kind of Christian life.
[258]  Christ today is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit within us.
[259]  Instead of making up our minds to do certain things, we should simply live by the Christ who is now the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.
[260]  This Person is the all-inclusive Christ, the One who is the reality of every positive thing in the universe.
[261]  Although it is a wonderful and glorious fact that we are now in Christ, this is nevertheless just a matter of position.
[262]  This position does give us the right and privilege to participate in all that Christ is.
[263]  But with this right and privilege, we need to experience Christ living in us.
[264]  Now that we are in Christ, Christ wants to live in us.
[265]  For us to be in Christ is a matter of position; for Christ to be in us is a matter of experience and enjoyment.
[266]  If we were not in Christ, Christ could not be in us.
[267]  Once again we see that to be in Christ is a matter of position, whereas to have Christ in us is a matter of experience and enjoyment.
[268]  Simply knowing that we are in Christ does not give us the experience of Christ or the enjoyment of Christ.
[269]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT CHRIST LIVES IN ME Scripture Reading: Col 1:27; 3:4; Gal 2:20a; John 14:19-20; 15:4-5
[270]  Although the book of Colossians is short, it contains many things which are mysterious.
[271]  Now we come to a crucial question: What is our life?
[272]  Probably we all would answer this question by saying that our life is Christ.
[273]  For years we have pointed out that Christ is life, but perhaps we have not adequately paid our attention to what Christ is.
[274]  We need to see the heavenly vision that in His economy, God wants nothing except Christ.
[275]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE TO LIVE CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 2:13; 3:4; John 6:57; 14:19; 15:4-5
[276]  When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He did not live by His human life.
[277]  Although, as a man, He was a perfect and complete individual person with a life of His own, He lived by the life of the Father, not by His human life.
[278]  Our self-made and self-imposed culture, as well as the culture we have inherited, may be excellent, but as long as it is not Christ Himself, it is a hindrance to our experience of Christ, to our enjoyment of Christ, and to our living by Christ.
[279]  The all-inclusive Christ is to be our life 3:4 .
[280]  If Christ does not become our life, then all He is and all He attained and obtained remain objective.
[281]  However, we may have the doctrinal knowledge from the Bible that Christ is our life without living by Christ in a practical way day by day.
[282]  If we would experience Christ and live Him, we need to remain in an atmosphere of prayer.
[283]  Many of us can testify that by prayer we are brought into the spirit, where we are one with the Lord and take Him as our life.
[284]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FORTY OBJECTIVE REVELATION, SUBJECTIVE MINISTRY,
[285]  AND PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE Scripture Reading: Col 1:15-19, 25-29; 2:2b, 6, 9, 18, 23
[286]  In 1:25 we see that Paul became a minister according to the stewardship of God to complete the word of God.
[287]  In chapter one of Colossians we have a high revelation of who Christ is and of what Christ is.
[288]  Now in chapter two we have still another matter the practical experience of the objective Christ who has been subjectively ministered into us.
[289]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FORTY-ONE SELF-MADE AND SELF-IMPOSED CULTURE
[290]  Christians realize that Christ is God and that He became a man, lived on earth, died on the cross for our sins as our Redeemer, was buried, was resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven, and has been enthroned as the Lord and Head of all.
[291]  To confront the Gnostic concept that matter is evil, Paul put forth a most extensive revelation of Christ.
[292]  Whereas the Gnostics claim that material things are inherently evil, Paul pointed out that all things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ and that they are now subsisting in Christ.
[293]  He boldly pointed out that all things, including animals and reptiles regarded by Jews as unclean, were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ.
[294]  By the Lord s mercy and grace, we in the Lord s recovery do not care for our culture.
[295]  In this message I am especially burdened to point out the fact that we all have a self-made and self-imposed culture.
[296]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:27-28; 2:6-8, 13, 20, 19; 2:4, 8, 16, 18
[297]  In the book of Colossians a number of important phrases or expressions point to our experience of Christ.
[298]  Some of these phrases are Christ in you 1:27 , full-grown in Christ 1:28 , walk in Him 2:6 , according to Christ 2:8 , made alive together with Him 2:13 , died with Christ 2:20 , holding the Head 2:19 , out from whom 2:19 , and grows with the growth of God 2:19 .
[299]  These nine expressions give us a complete picture of the proper experience of Christ.
[300]  Furthermore, these points are neglected or altogether lacking among today s Christians, where there is little emphasis on walking in Christ, being according to Christ, or holding Christ as the Head.
[301]  On the one hand, Christ is in us; on the other hand, we are in Christ.
[302]  He is a Christ who can be in us, and a Christ in whom we can walk.
[303]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FORTY-THREE IDENTIFIED WITH CHRIST
[304]  In 1:27 Paul speaks of Christ in us, and in the following verse, of presenting every man full-grown in Christ.
[305]  According to John 15:4 and 5, first we are in Christ, then Christ is in us.
[306]  The two expressions, Christ in us and we in Christ, imply a divine, two-way traffic, a traffic which is a universal mystery.
[307]  In Galatians 3:27 Paul says, For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
[308]  The Christ in Galatians 3:27 is equal to the Father, Son, and Spirit in Matthew 28:19.
[309]  Therefore, to be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit.
[310]  Was it in the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, in the name of Christ Jesus, or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[311]  Then I went on to say that instead of arguing, we should simply enjoy the Father, Son, and Spirit, Christ Jesus, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[312]  I also told him that we may baptize one person into the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit; another, into Christ; and still another, into the Lord Jesus Christ or into Christ Jesus.
[313]  In Romans 6:4 Paul says, We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into death that as Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
[314]  Here Paul introduces the thought of burial; he says that with Christ we have been buried through baptism into death.
[315]  TO GROW WITH THE GROWTH OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 2:6, 7, 19; 1:28; Eph 4:15-16, 13
[316]  Because we have been grafted into Christ, we have entered into Him.
[317]  Our entrance into Christ is related to life and to the growth of life.
[318]  We do not enter into Christ in the same way that we walk into a room.
[319]  Whenever we baptize believers, we should help them realize that in baptism they will grow together with Christ, because they have been grafted into the crucified and resurrected Christ.
[320]  My burden in this message is to help the saints see what the genuine growth in life is.
[321]  In 2:19 we have the words holding the Head.
[322]  What does it mean to hold Christ as the Head?
[323]  If we truly hold Christ as the Head, we shall not be separated from Him by anything.
[324]  When we live by our culture instead of by Christ, we separate ourselves from Christ as the Head and are defrauded of our prize, which is the enjoyment of Christ.
[325]  However, if we are rooted in Christ and walk as He moves, we shall spontaneously absorb the riches of Christ into our being and grow with the growth of God.
[326]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE THE EXTENSIVE REVELATION
[327]  OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 3:11, 15-16
[328]  Many of us have seen the all-inclusiveness of Christ, but have not seen the extensiveness of Christ.
[329]  In 1:19 and 20 Paul continues, For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell, and through Him to reconcile all things to Him, making peace through the blood of His cross through Him, whether things on the earth or things in the heavens.
[330]  The fullness of God was pleased to dwell in Christ and to reconcile all things to Him.
[331]  Elsewhere in the New Testament we see that reconciliation involves God s chosen people, but here we see the reconciliation of all things to God.
[332]  All things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ.
[333]  In the various books of the New Testament, Christ is revealed for definite purposes.
[334]  In 1 Corinthians the revelation of Christ is to deal with the problems in the church, problems which included fornication and divisiveness.
[335]  In the book of Galatians Christ is revealed in contrast to Judaism with the law.
[336]  Because the Galatians had been distracted to the law and circumcision, Paul showed them that Christ replaces the law, that God s Son is versus man s religion.
[337]  God s intention is that we as His chosen people become saturated, permeated, filled, and clothed with Christ so that we may live Christ.
[338]  AND BEING BUILT UP IN HIM Scripture Reading: Col 2:6-8, 16-17
[339]  The central and underlying thought of the book of Colossians is that, according to God s ordination, Christ should replace all the elements and factors of our natural human life with Himself.
[340]  In Romans Paul says that in Christ we are dead to sin, whereas here in Colossians he says that we have died with Christ from the elements of the world, that is, from the factors of our natural human life.
[341]  Christ has come in to replace all the aspects of culture mentioned in 2:8, 16-17, 20-21; and 3:11.
[342]  Christ must come into our human living to replace philosophy, tradition, and the elements of the world.
[343]  When all these things have been fully replaced by Christ, only Christ will remain.
[344]  To walk in Christ means not to have any substitute for Christ.
[345]  Because of man s fall, culture replaces God in man s life.
[346]  Now in His economy God has ordained that Christ, His Son, should accomplish redemption, bring man back to God, and then replace all the substitutes with Himself.
[347]  In the matter of shopping we should simply live Christ and not care for anything other than Christ.
[348]  No matter how old or young we may be, we all have been deeply rooted in our culture with the many factors and elements which make up our daily living.
[349]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN ROOTED AND BUILT UP IN CHRIST
[350]  We have pointed out that the book of Colossians first gives us an objective revelation of the extensive and all-inclusive Christ.
[351]  Then it presents the subjective ministry, the stewardship, by which the all-inclusive Christ is dispensed into us.
[352]  The antecedent of the pronoun Him is Christ in the preceding verse.
[353]  Since Christ is the mystery of God, to be rooted in Christ is to be rooted in the mystery of God.
[354]  Paul s use of the words being built up in 2:7 do not refer in a direct way to the building up of the Body of Christ.
[355]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT THE RECEIVING OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 2:1-6; John 1:1-4, 11-18
[356]  In 2:6 Paul says, As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.
[357]  In order to understand what is the proper, genuine, and adequate receiving of Christ, we need to know the Christ whom we are to receive.
[358]  In 2:1-2 Paul says that he had a great struggle for the saints that their hearts may be comforted, being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.
[359]  We also need the full assurance of understanding, the full knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God.
[360]  We need the full knowledge with the full assurance of understanding that we have received the wonderful, unlimited, immeasurable, extensive Christ.
[361]  The Christ in Colossians is much more extensive than the Christ in whom most Christians believe.
[362]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FORTY-NINE FULL GROWN IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:27-29; Eph 4:13
[363]  The book of Colossians reveals that the all-inclusive, extensive Christ should replace every factor, element, and aspect of our natural human life.
[364]  Some saints may be rather proud of their pleasant disposition or of their natural virtues, such as humility, patience, and kindness.
[365]  Instead, you should allow the extensive Christ to replace even your good disposition and your virtues.
[366]  After some are convinced and subdued by our announcing of Christ, they need to be warned.
[367]  Hearing of the all-inclusive Christ, they may want to be filled with Christ and to live Christ.
[368]  If you were to love the world and care for worldly amusements, having no heart to be filled with Christ or to live Christ, the enemy would not pay much attention to you.
[369]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FIFTY CHRIST REPLACED IN EVERY WAY Scripture Reading: Col 2:2b-4, 6-8; 1:27; 3:3-4; 2:6-7a; 1 Cor 1:5, 7a, 9, 22-24; 2:2; Gal 1:14-16a; 2:20a; 4:19; 5:2, 4
[370]  In the book of Colossians Paul sets forth not only the revelation of the all-inclusive Christ, but also the experience of Christ.
[371]  In this message we shall see that in the experience of Christians, Christ has been replaced in every way.
[372]  In the New Testament three books portray the replacements of Christ: 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians.
[373]  In our daily living Christ is often replaced by our natural characteristics.
[374]  What we need to see is that culture is a replacement for Christ and that we should live Christ.
[375]  The book of Colossians presents both the objective aspect of Christ and the subjective aspect.
[376]  On the other hand, there is the definite indication that this Christ dwells in us subjectively.
[377]  We have already referred to 1:27, where Paul says that Christ in us is the hope of glory.
[378]  According to Paul, the Christ who is the mystery of God s economy is not merely the Christ at the right hand of God in the heavens, but also the Christ who is within us.
[379]  AND BEING BUILT UP IN HIM 1 Scripture Reading: Col 2:7a, 19; 3:10-11; 1 Cor 3:6, 9; 6:17; Eph 2:21; 4:13b, 15-16 A BOOK OF EXPERIENCE
[380]  The extensive, all-inclusive Christ revealed in this book is subjective to us, for He dwells in us as our hope of glory 1:27 , and He is our life 3:4 .
[381]  To say that Christ is our life means that Christ becomes us.
[382]  Although we definitely do not teach that we become God Himself or that we shall ever be worshipped as deity, it is nonetheless true that Christ dwells in us and that He is our life.
[383]  In order to be rooted in Christ, we must first be planted into Him.
[384]  Since Christ is both the tree and the good land, we can say that we have been grafted into Christ and also that we have been planted into Him.
[385]  As a result of being rooted in Christ and absorbing His riches into us, we grow in Him, just as trees grow by absorbing nourishment from the soil.
[386]  We have seen that if we would walk in Christ, we must be planted and rooted in Christ, the divine Spirit in our spirit, and remain in Him.
[387]  We may read a verse such as 2:7, which speaks of having been rooted in Christ and of being built up in Him, and we may assume that we understand it, when actually our understanding is very superficial.
[388]  In 2:19 Paul says that the Body grows with the growth of God.
[389]  In 1 Corinthians 3:9 Paul says that the saints are God s farm Gk.
[390]  . In 1 Corinthians 3:6 he says, I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the growth Gk.
[391]  In 1 Corinthians 1:9 we are told that we have been called into the fellowship of the Son of God, and, in verse 30, that of God we are now in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom.
[392]  In Ephesians Paul also speaks of growth and building.
[393]  RAISED, AND MADE ALIVE TOGETHER WITH HIM Scripture Reading: Col 2:8-15
[394]  In order to walk in Christ, we must fulfill the two conditions mentioned in verse 7: we must be rooted in Him and be in the process of being built up in Him.
[395]  Then we must beware that no one carries us off as spoil from the very Christ who is the mystery of God and in whom we should walk.
[396]  When we are rooted in Christ as the soil, the first thing to take place is that we are made full in Him 2:10 .
[397]  Because all things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ, and because all things subsist together in Christ, there is the expression of the Godhead, the divine Being, in the old creation.
[398]  In 2:8-15 Paul s emphasis is that the believers are in Christ and should be according to Christ.
[399]  It is a fact that we are in Christ.
[400]  Having seen the wonderful fact that we have received Christ as the mystery of God and have been rooted in Him, we must now take heed lest we be carried off from such a Christ.
[401]  Romans 8:4 is a verse that is parallel to Colossians 2:8 in the sense that it tells us to walk according to spirit.
[402]  To walk according to spirit is to walk according to Christ.
[403]  If you walk in this way, you will do certain things or refrain from doing things, not because you are conforming to the practice of the local churches, but because you are walking according to Christ.
[404]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE NOT DEFRAUDED OF YOUR PRIZE
[405]  OF THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 2:16-19; 1:25-28
[406]  We have pointed out a number of times that Paul s ministry was a ministry of completing the word of God.
[407]  If you do not enjoy Christ in your eating and drinking, and if you do not enjoy Christ as the real clothing while you are dressing yourself, you have been defrauded of your prize of the enjoyment of Christ.
[408]  By the Lord s mercy, we may live a very upright life.
[409]  But although we may be kept from sin, we may still be very much short of Christ.
[410]  But still we must ask a crucial question: How much do we experience Christ and enjoy Him?
[411]  This mystery is Christ in us, the hope of glory v. 27 . Although we may have considerable knowledge of the Bible, we do not have the completion of the divine revelation unless we adequately experience Christ daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.
[412]  Everything we do will remind us to contact Christ, to enjoy Christ, to experience Christ, and to have Christ as our everything.
[413]  Further help concerning the practical enjoyment of Christ is found in 2:7.
[414]  According to this verse, we have been rooted in Christ.
[415]  In a foregoing message we pointed out that this rich soil contains many marvelous elements: the fullness of the Godhead, the headship of Christ, Christ s circumcision, His burial, being raised up with Christ, the wiping out of the ordinances, and the stripping off of the rulers and authorities.
[416]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-SIX HOLDING THE HEAD, OUT FROM WHOM
[417]  Colossians 2:18 and 19 say, Let no one purposely defraud you of your prize, in humility and worship of the angels, standing on things which he has seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh, and not holding the Head, out from Whom all the Body, by means of the joints and bands being supplied and knit together, grows with the growth of God.
[418]  If we do not hold the Head but stand on things which we have seen, we shall be defrauded of our prize of the enjoyment of Christ.
[419]  In 2:17 Paul says that the body is of Christ, but in verse 19 he speaks not of Christ, but of holding the Head.
[420]  The reason for the change in terminology from Christ to the Head is that our enjoyment of the Lord causes us to become conscious of the Body.
[421]  If we are those who enjoy Christ continually, we shall not continue to be individualistic.
[422]  The enjoyment of Christ also brings us into the ascension.
[423]  The more we enjoy Him, the more we are in the heavenlies experientially.
[424]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-SEVEN HAVING DIED WITH CHRIST FROM THE ELEMENTS
[425]  In chapter two Paul says that Christ is the mystery of God and that in Him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.
[426]  Now that we have received such a Christ, we should walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him.
[427]  Furthermore, in Christ we were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, we were buried with Him in baptism, and we were also raised together in Him vv.
[428]  Seeking for further help in understanding the fact of our crucifixion with Christ, I read books which encouraged me to reckon myself dead.
[429]  In 4:2 Paul says, Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving.
[430]  If we would stay in the spirit, we need to watch and pray, even to pray without ceasing 1 Thes 5:17 .
[431]  The principle is the same in being raised with Christ.
[432]  If we stay in the spirit, we shall have the sense deep within that we have been uplifted, raised up with Christ.
[433]  AND SET YOUR MIND ON THEM Scripture Reading: Col 3:1-3; Heb 2:9a; 4:14-16; 7:25; 6:19-20; 8:1-2; Acts 2:36; Eph 1:20-23; Rev 4:1, 2, 5; 5:6
[434]  In 3:1 Paul tells us to seek the things which are above, and in verse 2, to set our mind on the things which are above.
[435]  Between Christ as the fullness of God in chapter one and the new man in chapter three we have the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Him.
[436]  At this point we may ask how we can enjoy Christ and have Him constituted into us when He is in heaven and we are on earth.
[437]  The answer lies in the fact that there is a transmission taking place from Christ in heaven to us on earth by means of the all-inclusive Spirit.
[438]  In Hebrews 6:19 and 20 we see that the Lord Jesus is the Forerunner, the Pioneer, who has cut the way into glory within the veil.
[439]  As our Forerunner, our Pioneer, Christ is now in glory.
[440]  The fact that Christ is Lord of all means that the whole earth is the Lord s. The enthroned and glorified Christ is also the Head, the Forerunner and Pioneer, the High Priest, the heavenly Minister, and the Lamb on the throne of God s administration.
[441]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE ONE POSITION, ONE LIFE, ONE LIVING,
[442]  ONE DESTINY, AND ONE GLORY WITH CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 3:1-4; 1 John 4:15, 13; 1 Cor 6:17
[443]  Colossians 3:1-4 implies that with Christ we have one position, one life, one living, one destiny, and one glory.
[444]  Because we and Christ have one position, we are where He is.
[445]  We need to ask ourselves, then, whether we are in heaven or on earth.
[446]  The proper way to answer is to say that when we are in spirit we are also in heaven, but when we are not in spirit we are on earth and, experientially, even under the earth.
[447]  According to our experience, we know that in spirit we may be in heaven one minute and then, because we do not remain in our spirit, we may immediately plunge down to the earth.
[448]  We should not think that God has one life, that Christ has another life, and that we who believe in Christ have yet another life.
[449]  The one life we share with Christ is also a resurrected life.
[450]  To seek the things which are above and to set our mind on them is to join ourselves to the Lord in His ministry in heaven.
[451]  We need to join ourselves to the very One who is interceding, ministering, and executing God s administration.
[452]  This means that we live in such a way as to join our heavenly Christ in His priesthood, ministry, and administration.
[453]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE SIXTY CHRIST AS ALL THE MEMBERS
[454]  In the second chapter of Colossians we see that Christ is the mystery of God v. 2 , the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead v. 9 , and the reality of all positive things vv.
[455]  As the One who is the very embodiment of God, Christ is the reality of all positive things for our enjoyment.
[456]  When we enjoy Him in this way, we immediately realize that He is the Head of the Body v. 19 . In 3:4 Paul goes on to say that Christ is our life.
[457]  Because our life is ourself and because Christ is our life, we may say that Christ has become us.
[458]  If we enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things, we shall take Him as our food, drink, clothing, transportation, and housing.
[459]  If we go on to enjoy and experience Him as the mysterious life within us and live together with Him, we shall seek the things above, the things in heaven, where Christ is interceding, ministering, and administrating God s economy.
[460]  Christ in heaven is very active, even more busy than when He was on earth.
[461]  If we seek the things above and have one living with Christ, we shall be wholly occupied with the enterprise of our Master.
[462]  Our heart will be with Him in heaven, where He is interceding for the churches, supplying the saints, and administrating God s government.
[463]  If we take Christ as life and seek the things which are above in such a way, the lustful members will be put to death, the evil elements in the fallen soul will be put away, and the old man will be put off.
[464]  Concerning this, Paul says in 3:11, Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.
[465]  When we take Christ as our life and live together with Him, seeking the things which are above, we have the sense deep within that we are one with Christ and that Christ is us.
[466]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE ONE WITH CHRIST IN THE THINGS ABOVE Scripture Reading: Col 3:1-3; Heb 4:14; 7:24-26; 8:1-2
[467]  In writing Epistles such as Ephesians and Colossians, Paul first presents a revelation, mainly of Christ and the church, and then speaks concerning our Christian walk.
[468]  After presenting so many marvelous truths concerning Christ, Paul tells us to therefore seek the things which are above, where Christ is.
[469]  Married brothers know how difficult it is for husbands to truly love their wives, and married sisters know that it is difficult for wives to be genuinely submissive to their husbands.
[470]  The word therefore in 3:1 indicates that we need to look back at chapters one and two, since Paul s word in chapters three and four is based upon what he has covered in the first two chapters.
[471]  Since Christ has been wrought into us to be our life, and since we have been brought into God, where our life is hidden with Christ, we should no longer be occupied with the elements of the world.
[472]  The young people may need to testify to their parents that they are young people with Christ in them and that they are with Christ in God.
[473]  Oh, may we all realize that according to the Bible, Christ is in us as our hope of glory and that with Christ we are hidden in God!
[474]  Perhaps you are wondering what the Lord Jesus is doing in heaven to reach the goal of building up His Body.
[475]  According to the book of Hebrews, Christ today is the High Priest and the heavenly Minister 2:17; 4:14; 7:26; 8:1-2 .
[476]  In His intercession Christ brings us with our need to God.
[477]  The things above mentioned in Colossians 3 are the things related to the heavenly ministry of Christ, to Christ s ministry as our High Priest and God s Minister.
[478]  The last two chapters of Colossians cover various aspects of the Christian walk.
[479]  The second aspect of the Christian walk revealed in Colossians 3 is the renewing of the new man.
[480]  According to 3:10, the new man is being renewed unto full knowledge.
[481]  In 3:11 Paul goes on to say, Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.
[482]  In the renewing of the new man, Christ is all and in all.
[483]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-THREE THE PEACE OF CHRIST
[484]  ARBITRATING IN OUR HEART Scripture Reading: Col 3:12-16; Eph 2:14-18
[485]  As we have pointed out, these things are related to what Christ is doing in heaven.
[486]  According to the sequence of chapter three of Colossians, after the setting of the mind on the things above and the renewing of the new man, we have the peace of Christ arbitrating in our heart v. 15 . Do you know what the peace of Christ is? This term is used just once in the New Testament.
[487]  Elsewhere, in Romans and in Philippians, Paul speaks of the God of peace.
[488]  For the peace of Christ to arbitrate in our hearts, it must rule in us.
[489]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-FOUR THE WORD OF CHRIST INHABITING US Scripture Reading: Col 3:15-18; Heb 1:1-2a; Rev 2:1, 7a ONENESS A NECESSARY CONDITION
[490]  Immediately after speaking about the peace of Christ arbitrating in us, Paul goes on to tell us to let the word of Christ dwell in us.
[491]  Why does Paul mention the peace of Christ before the word of Christ?
[492]  We thank the Lord that the situation in His recovery is altogether different from this.
[493]  When the peace of Christ arbitrates in us and keeps us in a situation full of oneness and harmony, we become the place of God s speaking, His oracle.
[494]  LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-FIVE PERSEVERING IN PRAYER Scripture Reading: Col 4:2-6; Heb 4:14-16
[495]  In the foregoing messages we have covered four important aspects of the Christian walk revealed in chapters three and four of Colossians: setting our mind on the things above, the renewing of the new man, the peace of Christ arbitrating in us, and the word of Christ inhabiting us.
[496]  If we have these four things, we shall have a proper Christian walk.
[497]  In light of the fact that there is great resistance to praying, let us now consider in a very practical way how to persevere in prayer.
[498]  In charging us to persevere in prayer, Paul tells us to watch in it with thanksgiving 4:2 .
[499]  This indicates that if we are not thankful to God for anything, we must be lacking in prayer.
