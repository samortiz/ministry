[2]  The moment we believe in the Lord, we should set apart the early morning for fellowshipping with God and for contacting Him.
[3]  Song of Songs 7:12 shows us that the early morning is the best time to fellowship with the Lord.
[4]  To fellowship means to open up our spirit and our mind to God and allow Him to enlighten us, speak to us, impress us, and touch us Psa 119:105, 147 .
[5]  As the real manna, Christ was sent by God the Father v. 32 for God's chosen people to live by Christ v. 57 . 2 Just as manna sustained nearly two million people in the wilderness for forty years, so Christ as the real manna sustains the church today.
[6]  On the one hand, the Lord Jesus is "the bread out of heaven"; on the other hand, He is "the bread of God," the One who came down out of heaven to be our food John 6:32-33 .
[7]  Since we all love the Lord, and we know that the Lord desires to build up His Body by our growth in life, we must have a daily revival.
[8]  Acts 16:31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved
[9]  John 1:12-13 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten of God.
[10]  1 John 5:13 I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.
[11]  Rom 8:16 The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.
[12]  1 John 3:14 We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers.
[13]  Therefore, since we enjoy calling God "Abba, Father," and do it spontaneously, even with a sweet and comfortable sensation, this proves that we have God's life and are children begotten of God.
[14]  By our believing believing in the Lord we have life and have passed out of death into life; by our loving loving the brothers we know that we have life and that we have passed out of death into life.
[15]  John 10:28 And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.
[16]  The Lord has given this life to us and has brought us into an eternal relationship with God, a relationship in life, so that we can never be separated from Him.
[17]  According to this covenant, God will forgive the sins of all those who believe in the Lord Jesus and will not remember their iniquities any longer; He will impart His laws into their mind and inscribe them on their hearts; He will be God to them and they will be a people to Him; and they all will know God and will not need others to teach them.
[18]  Therefore, God has shown us in His Word from different angles that once we are saved, we are eternally saved, we are eternally perfected, we shall by no means perish eternally, and we are eternally secure.
[19]  Mark 16:16 He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.
[20]  26 To believe is to receive Christ not only for forgiveness of sins Acts 10:42 but also for regeneration 1 Pet 1:21, 23 , so that those who believe may become the children of God John 1:12-13 and the members of Christ Eph 5:30 in an organic union with the Triune God Matt 28:19 .
[21]  Matt 28:19 Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[22]  Which water also now saves you, that is, baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh but the appeal of a good conscience unto God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[23]  To baptize someone into the name of the Triune God is to immerse him into all that the Triune God is.
[24]  33 Furthermore , baptism practiced in a proper, genuine, and living way puts the believers into Christ, a living person Gal 3:27 ; into the death of Christ, an effective death Rom 6:3 ; and into the Body of Christ, a living organism 1 Cor 12:13 , that the believers may enter into an organic union not only with Christ but also with His Body.
[25]  Gen 1:27 And God created man in His own image
[26]  The Mingled Spirit God Created Man in His Image as a Vessel to Contain Him
[27]  The Bible tells us that Christ is the image of God 2 Cor 4:4b; Col 1:15 41 .
[28]  Romans 9:21 tells us that God created us and chose us that we might be vessels to contain Him.
[29]  John 3:6 That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
[30]  4:24 God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.
[31]  When a sinner repents, confesses his sins, believes in the Lord Jesus, and calls on His name, at that very moment Christ as the life-giving Spirit enters into his spirit to enliven his dead spirit, that is, to regenerate him in his spirit.
[32]  In order for us to experience the Christian life, we surely need to know God, the Lord, Christ, as the Spirit.
[33]  We all need to see that our believing in Jesus and our being baptized into Him means that He comes into us and we are put into Him so that He and we become one.
[34]  In order to contact God in spirit, sometimes we have to stop the activities of our body and our soul, and then we have to cry out to God and call on the Lord Jesus from our deepest part.
[35]  Rom 10:13 For "whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[36]  1 Cor 12:13 For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.
[37]  3 And no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.
[38]  John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[39]  1 Pet 2:2-3 As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, if you have tasted that the Lord is good.
[40]  Matt 4:4 But He answered and said, It is written, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God."
[41]  It does not say that we know this aspect or that aspect about the Lord, but that we taste the Lord.
[42]  If we desire to enjoy the Lord and be nourished by the Lord, we must come to the Word to taste the Lord.
[43]  Eph 6:17-18 And receive the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit
[44]  John 6:63 It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.
[45]  Pray-reading the Word When Coming to the Bible, Having to Prepare Ourselves to Enter into Fellowship with God
[46]  John 5:39-40 You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.
[47]  Therefore, whenever you come to read the Bible, if you just read the dead letters and do not breathe in what God has breathed out, then the Bible will be dead letters to you.
[48]  The Scripture is the breathing out of God, whereas our prayer is our breathing in. By this breathing out and breathing in, we breathe God into us.
[49]  He also said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" v. 57 . Because of His concern at that time that the disciples who listened to Him might not understand the meaning of His words, He added the words in verse 63, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life." Therefore, you can see that the Lord's words are the food of life to us.
[50]  The word in the Bible is not only the breath of God, the bread of life, and the word of God; it is also the embodiment of God.
[51]  Col 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.
[52]  By comparing verses 4 and 7 of John 15 , we can see that the way the Lord abides in us is by His words abiding in us.
[53]  The practical way to have the Lord abiding in us is simply by taking His Word in. Whenever we touch the Word and let the Word abide in us, we touch the Lord Himself and let the Lord Himself abide in us.
[54]  In Ephesians 5:18 Paul charges us to "be filled in spirit," no doubt with the Spirit of God.
[55]  The redeeming blood washes away our sins 1 John 1:7; Rev 7:14 , whereas the water of life washes away the blemishes of the natural life of our old man, such as "spot or wrinkle or any such things" v. 27 . In sanctifying the church, the Lord firstly washes away our sins with His blood Heb 13:12 and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life.
[56]  Hymns, #811 My heart is hungry, my spirit doth thirst;
[57]  I come to Thee, Lord, to seek Thy supply;
[58]  2 Cor 5:17 So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[59]  Because we have a new life, the divine life, we can now live and behave in the presence of God through the sense of this life and through the moving of the Spirit within us.
[60]  1 Thes 1:9 You turned to God from the idols to serve a living and true God.
[61]  83 To turn to God from idols is not only to turn away from false gods, with the devil and demons at their back, but also from all things that replace God.
[62]  Luke 19:8 And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much.
[63]  If we are willing to go before the Lord in this way, we will see that after we are saved through regeneration, we not only should abandon the idols, destroy the demonic and dirty things, and restore what we owe, but we also should conclude entirely our old way of living and have a new beginning.
[64]  If we follow the demand of our inner feeling to confess our sins, to abandon idols, to destroy demonic and unclean things, to restore what we owe , and to end our old way of living, we will surely feel strengthened, enlightened, satisfied, and enlivened; we will also feel peaceful, secure, and full of the presence of the Lord.
[65]  2 Cor 5:14-15 For the love of Christ constrains us and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.
[66]  After we have been born again, there is still much work for God to do in our lives, and there is also much service that we can render to God.
[67]  Whenever the Holy Spirit sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts, we will naturally be willing to become the prisoners of love and consecrate ourselves to God.
[68]  When we really meet the love of God, we feel that our all must be offered up to Him; yet at the same time we feel that our richest offering is as refuse in the light of His love.
[69]  Rom 12:1 I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice
[70]  Hymns, #309 What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
[71]  1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[72]  Once we have consecrated ourselves to God that He may use us, God must cleanse us, deal with us, and purge away all our problems so that we may be fit for His use.
[73]  We see from the above scriptures how we are to deal with sins: towards men, we must be reconciled with them and be well disposed toward them; towards God, we must confess our sins; and concerning sin, we must forsake it.
[74]  Matt 5:23-24 If you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, first go and be reconciled to your brother
[75]  1 John 1:7 But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.
[76]  In carrying it out, however, God does not require us to deal with all the sins at once, but to deal with all those that we are conscious of while in fellowship with Him.
[77]  We do not mean to say that we must deal with all the sins that we have actually committed, but only with those we are conscious of while in fellowship with God.
[78]  Therefore this means that when we are having fellowship with God and are conscious of any discord between ourselves and others, or vice versa, we should immediately endeavor to rectify this situation lest our fellowship with God be affected or hindered.
[79]  First John 1:7 indicates that if we have fellowship with God, we can see our sins in His light; then, according to what we have seen in His light, we are to confess this to God and deal with it before God in order to obtain God's forgiveness and cleansing.
[80]  In order that our dealings be properly and soundly carried out to the end that God may be glorified, that we obtain grace, and that others be benefitted, we shall now discuss a few technical points in accordance with the four principles we have mentioned.
[81]  James 4:4 Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?
[82]  If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him; because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father but is of the world.
[83]  Rom 12:2 And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.
[84]  1 Cor 12:12 For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.
[85]  Col 2:19 Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body grows with the growth of God.
[86]  The Body of Christ The Body of Christ Being the Expression of Christ
[87]  Eph 4:15-16 But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[88]  139 First Corinthians 14 stresses that the top gift, the gift that excels all other gifts, developed by our enjoyment of Christ is prophesying v. 12 . 140 This is the excelling gift because it builds up the church 14:4b-5 . 141 Without prophesying, there is no possibility of building up the Body of Christ.
[89]  To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, and in our speaking for the Lord, we have to speak forth the Lord and speak the Lord into others.
[90]  Exo 5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Let My people go that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.
[91]  Lev 25:55 For the children of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.
[92]  As long as we are saved and as long as we are children of God, we are servants of God.
[93]  5 So we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
[94]  When we come to the matter of serving the Lord, we all need to be very clear that we need the Body, and we need a heavenly vision concerning the Body.
[95]  May the Lord grant us all such a vision that will bring us into a full realization that we need to be in the reality of the Body, even that we cannot serve without the Body, and, in fact, that we cannot live, we cannot exist spiritually in life, outside the Body.
[96]  1 Pet 2:5 You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[97]  Rev 1:6 And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father
[98]  Rom 15:16 That I might be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, a laboring priest of the gospel of God, in order that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable.
[99]  196 Moreover , the gospel is Christ, who is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God, reaching us as the consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God for our enjoyment.
[100]  The gospel is concerning Jesus Christ the God-man; hence, Jesus Christ the God-man is the center of the good news and the glad tidings of God to men.
[101]  Rom 1:14-15 I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish; so, for my part, I am ready to announce the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
[102]  Rom 1:9 For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers.
[103]  Acts 4:31 And when they had so besought, they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.
[104]  The first thing that we must do is ask God for people, asking Him to give men to the Lord Jesus and to add them to the church.
