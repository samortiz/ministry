   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTENT OF THE TRAINING THE GROWTH IN LIFE AND THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this term of training, I do not have the burden to release any new vision as I have done in special meetings and conferences in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I will just sit down to converse with you concerning two main things: the growth in life and the practice of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to spiritual sequence, life should be first and the new way second, but according to my burden, the new way should be first.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I will spend sixteen hours, one hour each week, to talk to you about the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The new way has been misunderstood, rejected, and even, to some extent, slandered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some have said that the full-time training in Taipei was a "Hagar" and that all the ones baptized through door-knocking were "Ishmaels."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a very serious, evil slander.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So I must spend some time to give sixteen talks about the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I will speak four times each week concerning these two things, dealing with them in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Related to the matter of life, what I will talk with you about is the experience of life and the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning the new way, we will spend some time to look into the new way, and we will also talk about the exercise of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even though I have released quite a number of messages in the past four and a half years about the new way, there is still the need of some deeper insight concerning the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>ONLY THE ETERNAL LIFE OF GOD IS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps most of you have read the book entitled The Experience of Life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The messages contained in that book were given in 1953 and 1954 and printed two or three years later.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So this book has been among us for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, today, though I may refer to that book, I will not speak according to that book.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, I will talk to you according to your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is life?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Or who is life?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the Scriptures, in the whole universe, there is only one life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the other lives may be considered "non-life" because they are temporal lives.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are many different kinds of life, such as that of the mosquitos, termites, ants, wolves, dogs, and tigers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are also different categories of life, such as the vegetable life and the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The highest of all these created lives is the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet, all of these lives, including the human life, are temporal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only one life exists without beginning and without ending.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only one life is the source of life, the substance of life, the element of life, and the factor of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This life is called the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This life is eternal, not only in time, but also in source, in substance, in element, and in factor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eternal means unlimited and unrestricted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This eternal life is not bound, limited, or restricted in time, in source, in substance, in element, or in factor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In every aspect and in every regard, this life is unlimited and unrestricted.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This life is eternal in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible tells us that when we believed into the Lord Jesus, we received such an eternal life John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many Christians do not understand the term eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Have you ever heard that this eternal life is eternal not only in time but also in quality, substance, element, factor, and even in its source?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With all the other lives, the created lives, there are some restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For instance, we have strength, but our strength is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have might, power, and ability, but we are limited in each one of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are very limited in our might, our power, and our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We as human beings have more strength, power, and ability than any other created life; yet our strength, power, and ability are all with some restriction and limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may be able to endure, but regardless how long we can endure, our endurance is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's endurance, however, is not limited.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only one life, the eternal life, is unlimited in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This eternal life is not only of God but is the very God Himself.</S>
