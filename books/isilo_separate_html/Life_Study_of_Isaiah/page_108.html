Jehovah Telling Israel Not to Fear</H2><P>In verse 1 Jehovah tells Israel not to fear. This verse says, "Now thus says Jehovah/Who created you, O Jacob, and who formed you, O Israel:/Do not fear, because I have redeemed you;/I have called you by your name; you are Mine."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah Being the Holy One<br>of Israel, Their Savior</H2><P>Verses 2 and 3a continue, "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you,/And through the rivers, they will not flow over you./And when you walk through the fire, you will not be burned,/And the flame will not consume you./ Because I am Jehovah your God,/The Holy One of Israel, your Savior." Verse 4 goes on to say that Israel is precious and honorable in the eyes of Jehovah. To be precious is a matter of value, and to be honorable is a matter of position or state. As God's people, we should be both precious and honorable.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_107.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_109.html">Next</a> </body></html>
