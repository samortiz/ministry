BEING HIS RELEASE</h2>
<p>The death of Christ on the cross released the life that was within Him; hence, this death was actually His release. The Lord Jesus came to the earth through incarnation&mdash;full of the unlimited life of God (John 1:14)&mdash;in order to impart His life into many people. His unlimited life was constrained within the outer shell of His humanity. Therefore, His outer shell needed to be broken through death so that the life concealed within Him could be released. In terms of the life concealed in Him, the Lord Jesus was constrained even before His outer shell was broken through death. In Luke 12:50 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!&rdquo; The baptism with which the Lord was to be baptized was His death on the cross. Before this death was accomplished, He was pressed in the shell of the humanity that He had put on in incarnation. He said, &ldquo;How I am pressed!&rdquo; A grain of wheat is a good example of this. If a grain of wheat does not pass through death, the life within it is constrained within its outer shell. If a grain of wheat could speak, it would probably shout, &ldquo;I have a death to pass through, and how I am constrained!&rdquo; If a grain of wheat had any feeling, it would long to pass through death so that the life within it could be released. As soon as a grain dies, the life and fullness within it are released. The life that is released is able to multiply and bring forth many grains. However, until the grain dies, it is constrained within its outer shell. This was the situation when Christ, the Lord of life, was on the earth. Before He went to the cross to die, His unlimited, immeasurable divine life that transcends time and space was constrained within the man Jesus the Nazarene. In this sense, the Lord Jesus longed to die; He desired that the death of the cross would come quickly and that His baptism would be accomplished sooner so that He could be released and glorified (cf. John 17:1). Without death the Lord Jesus could neither be released nor glorified. When He died, He was released and He was glorified.</p>
<p>The purpose of Christ coming to the earth and becoming flesh was to die on the cross. Incarnation alone was not the purpose of His coming to the earth; death was the ultimate purpose of His coming to the world. He became flesh for the sake of death. The Lord&rsquo;s word in Luke 12:50 indicates that He longed to die, because through death He would be released and would enter into glory. When the death of the cross was imminent, the Lord prayed, &ldquo;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You&rdquo; (John 17:1). When the Lord appeared to two of His disciples on their way to Emmaus after His death and resurrection, He pointed out that His death was for Him to enter into glory (Luke 24:26).</p>
<p>The life, glory, and beauty within a grain of wheat are released through death. Likewise, the life and glory within Christ were released through His death. The life in Christ is rich, bright, and glorious, but there was no way, apart from death, for the glorious life within Him to be released. When the Lord Jesus died, the life within Him was released, and He entered into glory.</p>
<p>The glorious life in Christ was released like a fire, and it kindled a fire in whomever it entered (12:49). This fire of life was kindled in Peter, John, and the other apostles. This fire of life continues to burn without ceasing even until today. The past two thousand years of church history prove that this released fire changed the little Galilean fishermen into bold and powerful men, and it has also changed cowardly and filthy sinners into strong and sanctified witnesses. This fire of life cannot be suppressed by any environment, force, opposition, or attack. This fire of life was released through the death of Christ on the cross. We must see and remember that the positive function and the central purpose of the cross are to release the life of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross was His release.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
