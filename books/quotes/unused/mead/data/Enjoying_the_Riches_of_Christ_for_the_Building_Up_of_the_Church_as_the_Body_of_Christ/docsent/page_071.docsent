   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT CARING FOR THE REPROACH OF OPPOSERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Please read Ezra, Nehemiah, Hosea, and Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people despised and reproached the rebuilding of Jerusalem, saying that what the returned ones were building was a small matter Neh 4:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is the building a small matter?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Wait and see.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord does not care for spiritual giants; spiritual giants mean little to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord will harvest all the wandering seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the United States the crop is ripe, and the timing is right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the time for the Lord's harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord will bring in the wanderers like a flock.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He will satisfy every hungry, seeking saint by means of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although I am working hard all the time, every night I have a good sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am so happy that the Lord's recovery is not a human doing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is the Lord's doing today on the earth, and it is absolutely new.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord's care for His recovery can be illustrated by His care for the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Recently, after the Arab leaders conspired together in a conference, the Lord looked at Nasser, the Egyptian leader, and seemed to say, "You are ready to go," and Nasser died.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even some secular newspapers said that the death of Nasser was a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since that time, there have been no great leaders among the Arab countries.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Egypt gained military and economic skills from Russia, but recently Egypt cut off all its high officials who were in favor of Communism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Russia was puzzled over this, not knowing what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This also was the Lord's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The unity of the Arab countries has been broken, and little Israel is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Praise the Lord, the Arab countries cannot do anything with the little nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In a similar way, the recovery of the church life is something of the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>GAINING A BOAST FOR THE LORD AND A SHAME TO THE ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through our experiences, many can testify that when we are for the building in our church service, we are so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nothing makes us as happy as being built together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even to know the Bible does not make us very happy, but when we are coordinated in the church service, we are in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a confirmation from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the indication of where He is and the sign of what He is after.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord is after His building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This building is a shame to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The little Satan is shaking; he is trembling at the building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is afraid of nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is not afraid to see people saved, but he is afraid of the building up of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no need to speak of eighty to a hundred being built up; if only thirty to fifty are built up in a locality, this will shake Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, as we have seen, we need growth and transformation for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nothing muddy or natural is qualified for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only the Lord Himself is qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the materials for the building of the city of God must be gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There must be nothing muddy or wooden.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we need transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Praise the Lord, we are under the process of the Lord's transformation!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have been in the Lord's recovery for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I can tell you and the Lord can testify, I was very happy in the past because I saw the Lord's recovery, but I have never been as happy as I am now in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be here in the United States is like a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We never dreamed that we would be here, but here we are.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before I came to this country, certain ones spoke poorly to me about American Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This disappointed me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But now that I am here, I am not disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Day by day I am encouraged from many directions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What I have seen is absolutely different from what I heard.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What I heard was black, but what I now see is white.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is marvelous, and it is the Lord's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the Lord doing?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is doing the work of building.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Preaching is for the building; the study of the Word is for the building; the inner life is for the building; the gifts are for the building; and the mission field is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everything in the Christian work must be for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the Lord's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is a shame to the enemy and a boast to the Lord.</S>
