   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RENEWING OF OUR MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 1 tells us that our lamp has been enlightened and is now shining.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 3 tells us we need an extra portion of the all-inclusive Spirit to fill up our soul, our heart, and every part of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 4:23 says, "And are renewed in the spirit of your mind."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that the Spirit comes into our mind and becomes the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need the Spirit to become the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This spirit in our mind is the renewing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This Spirit transforms us by pervading, saturating, and possessing our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be regenerated is to have our spirit enlightened, quickened, and made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After being regenerated in our spirit, we need to be transformed in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regeneration is God coming into our spirit; transformation is God saturating our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our spirit is the center of our being, and surrounding our spirit is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's economy is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God first comes into our spirit and fills our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then He spreads Himself from our spirit into our soul, saturating our soul, possessing it, and fully making His home in it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is in this way that we will be completely possessed, occupied, saturated, and mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is regeneration plus transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Never forget that regeneration is accomplished in our spirit and that transformation is accomplished in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not sufficient just to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is only the beginning of the spiritual experience within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Regeneration, the start of our spiritual life, means that God has come into our spirit to enlighten us, quicken us, and make us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After regeneration, we need to cooperate with the Lord, allowing Him to take a further step to spread Himself from our spirit into our soul, saturating our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may express this experience in several ways: it is to prepare the extra portion of the Triune God in our vessels; it is to have the transformation accomplished in our soul; it is to have our whole being mingled with the Triune God; and it is to become matured in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the book of Matthew we have seen that Christ as the seed has been sown into our spirit and that He will grow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Matthew 13 reveals that to have Christ grow in us means to have Him spread from our spirit into our heart, into all the inward parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This spreading of the seed is not only the growth, but also the maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seed that has been sown into our spirit will grow, spreading into our inward parts until it saturates our whole being and possesses all of our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When this is accomplished, we will be mature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's economy is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He forgives our sins, justifies us, and saves us, but these items are not His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His goal is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Forgiveness, justification, and salvation are all for His goal of working Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This work is carried out in three steps.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first step is the regeneration of our spirit, the second is the transformation of our soul, and the third is the transfiguration of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not need to pay anything for regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is free.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, we will not have to pay for the transfiguration of our body in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That also will be free.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But by God's wisdom, we must pay something for the transformation of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God will take these three steps to thoroughly mingle Himself with our whole spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because we have three parts, God needs three steps to saturate us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we have the regeneration of the spirit, the transformation of the soul, and the transfiguration of the body.</S>
