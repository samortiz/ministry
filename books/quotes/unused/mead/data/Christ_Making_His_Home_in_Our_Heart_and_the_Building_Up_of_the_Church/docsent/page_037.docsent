   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN LEARNING LESSONS FROM OUR TRIALS LEARNING TO RECEIVE MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND NOT BE INFLUENCED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to pray for the overseas saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We enjoy the Lord s blessing, but we hope that the blessing we enjoy will extend to other places, not only to other places in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord has brought a good number of overseas saints to be perfected in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to pray and ask the Lord to have mercy on them and to enable them to have a clear vision.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Often we may not be able to see a matter clearly, because we are not looking at it from a proper angle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, if we look at a house from different angles, we will see different views of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, we can have one view from the front of the house and another from the back.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the angle from which we view a physical object is important, how much more important is it with regard to spiritual things?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though we can have different views of a house, these different views will not have much influence on us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, in spiritual matters, our ability to clearly see depends not only on the pureness of our intentions but also on the depth of outside influence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must admit that none of us is so strong that we cannot be influenced by others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consequently, it is always difficult to discern things accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is difficult to know which influence is wrong and should be rejected and which influence is right and should be received.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hardly anyone among us is so strong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The factor that influences us the most is Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to my knowledge, the opposition of the Western missionaries against us is unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may not be aware of this, because you may not have much contact with others outside of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the strong and fierce opposition toward us is unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is so strong that it has become condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such opposition may not come directly to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, just like radio waves are in the air, the opposition can reach many people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is easy for the overseas saints, especially those from the West, to contact opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of spiritual radio wave can contact people at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot say that people are so strong that they cannot be affected by opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, we need to spend time to ask the Lord to cause the visiting saints, whether they are local, from Taiwan, or from the West, to receive mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that they would not be touched by any improper influence and that if they are, they would receive timely grace to have the proper discernment and be able to know which things to reject and which things to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a person receives mercy, he will see only positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I am a person who has received mercy, when I visit a brother, I will see only a brother who prays because he loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, if I am not a person who has received mercy, I will see a husband who fights with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It may be that they have never fought before, but on the day that I visit them, there is a fight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fact that I encounter such a situation proves that I have not received mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It may be that the brother fears God and never fights at home.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, the fact that he fights with his wife on the day that I visit him shows that I have not received mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I witness a brother fighting with his wife, it will be difficult for me to believe that he lives in a godly manner.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fight will influence me to such an extent that even if he truly lives before the Lord, I will still be affected.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows that I need to receive mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some people receive mercy and always see the good and positive situations in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This applies to what they see in the saints and to what they see in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When a person who receives mercy goes to a meeting, the meeting is good.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, this is not the case with a person who does not receive mercy; it may be that a brother stands up and gives a negative testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These matters are not under human control; they depend on God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I hope that by the Lord s mercy there would be no negative situations among us but that every situation would be positive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who oppose us are not the only ones who have a negative influence on the visiting saints from overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is possible that some of the saints among us or even those who are serving will be a negative influence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many times the speaking, attitude, and expression of the saints give visitors a negative impression.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must take this matter seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a person is pursuing spiritual things, he has tender feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a person is not pursuing spiritual things, his feelings are dull, and he is indifferent toward many things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It does not matter to him whether a brother becomes backslidden.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He has no reaction and even feels that it does not matter when a brother becomes lukewarm and loves the world, nor does it matter to him that a brother is living in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He has no feeling when others lose their temper or even when they are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything is the same to him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, a person who has been touched by the Holy Spirit and has a desire to pursue the Lord will be hot inside and outside.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that his feelings will be sensitive and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those who know spiritual matters know how serious this is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They will not dare to carelessly affect a person s spiritual sense.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One rainy day D. L. Moody had a gospel conversation with a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The conversation came to a critical juncture, and the woman was touched by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In other words, the conversation had come to the point that they were ready to kneel down and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Right at that moment a sister walked into the room and put down her umbrella.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The noise from the umbrella interrupted the atmosphere, and the gospel friend lost her feeling to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Moody was unable to bring the conversation back to the point of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may have had similar experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Such experiences prove that when a person desires God in his inner being, his feelings are very tender.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, we must realize that the saints who are visiting from out of town and those who are participating in the training have tender feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They will even sense something that is slightly wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The saints who have been here may not sense anything, but the visiting saints are full of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whatever situation they are in will form an indelible impression that will affect them for the rest of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, our attitude and our words are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For this reason, we must pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Recently I have been considering the book of Job and the matter of help.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There are different kinds of help.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We cannot say that Job s three friends did not intend to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They did not go to him with malice.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They had a heart of love and wanted to help their dear friend.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, they were self-confident.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They thought that they knew God, understood God s logic, and knew God s acts, ways, and principles in dealing with man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They told Job that if he put injustice far away from his tents, he would know God 22:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They believed that they knew the way to know God and the principle by which God deals with people.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They spoke concerning God out of their good intention.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, God said that the words spoken by Job and his three friends were without knowledge and darkened counsel 38:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is serious.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not easy to receive help from others, and it is also not easy to render help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When I speak to people concerning knowing God s ways and knowing God s principles, I am always full of fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I fear that I would be like one of Job s three friends.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I often ask myself, How can you be sure that the help you render to others is not like the help given to Job by his three friends?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>How can you be sure that your advice is not without knowledge and that it does not darken counsel?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is indeed serious.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>For this reason, I bear a very heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Many brothers and sisters will be coming from England, America, Canada, Denmark, and Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There will also be many Chinese saints from overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They will be here with a heart full of zeal and sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They are coming from faraway places to see and to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Their inner being is fresh and tender, and they will be easily influenced.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Hence, we must be careful concerning the impression they will receive while they are here.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Of course, they also bear some responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If they receive mercy, God will arrange for them to be in positive situations, but if they are not those who receive mercy, then God needs to be merciful to them.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Nevertheless, we must be responsible for the kind of influence we have on others.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We cannot rest or be at peace and think that the adversary, who has been damaging the building up of the church for the past two thousand years, will cease his work.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He will not stop.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The authority of darkness will try its best to damage and to spread negative, dead, and inaccurate information.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The enemy will try to blind the saints so that they are deceived into thinking that every situation is the same, and they will not receive mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Therefore, I am very burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We cannot govern or control any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We can only say that we need God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We all should pray concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We should also learn to have a serious attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We must be careful not to give the saints the wrong impression.</S>
