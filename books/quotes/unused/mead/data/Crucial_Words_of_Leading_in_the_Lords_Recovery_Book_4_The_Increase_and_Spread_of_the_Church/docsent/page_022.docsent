   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORMING SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first realm of our life is our family; the second realm is our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we meet, we should not follow Christianity by keeping religious rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Christianity the pastors give sermons, designated persons offer prayers, and the believers do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is not the way of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every one of us should be able to read the Word, pray, call hymns, and sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, everyone should be a prophet and an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone should function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, many of us have been meeting regularly for many years, but we are like a basketball team that is not well coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A family also requires coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though everyone is willing to eat, some in the family must be willing to cook and wash dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When meals are properly prepared and dishes are properly washed, a family will be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our problem is that our meals are not well prepared and our dishes are not washed properly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we must study our way of meeting, especially our small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Small Groups Being</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>a Gathering of Neighborhood Believers,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not a Unit of Formal Organization</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A small group is a gathering of a small number of neighboring believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not a unit of organization; it is only a gathering of eight or ten brothers and sisters who live close to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Attending Any Small Group</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>for the Sake of Convenience,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>according to the Lord s Leading</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the sake of convenience, a brother or sister can attend any small group according to the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though I have previously said that our small groups should be formed according to geography, it is permissible to go to another neighboring small group.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are no ironclad rules in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some may think that this will result in disorderliness, but this kind of disorderliness needs to be analyzed from the standpoint of whether or not the saints are living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not necessarily good to be so orderly but so dead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should enliven the saints, not kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Avoiding and Rejecting Natural Preferences</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>and Fleshly Choices</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though a saint can follow the Lord s leading and gather with another small group for the sake of convenience, he should absolutely avoid and reject natural preferences and fleshly choices.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though a saint can choose, his choice must be according to the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The leading brothers should not create ordinances but rather lead the saints to know the flesh and the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christianity regulates people so that they will not be disorderly, but the church must emphasize spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not Being a Religious Organization</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A small group is not a religious organization; consequently, there are no leading ones in a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the saints have equal obligations, equal responsibilities, and an equal opportunity to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that we would pay attention to this point and fully emphasize it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When eight or ten saints gather together, everyone is a leading one with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not Emphasizing Religious Rituals</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the small groups we should sing hymns and pray according to inspiration and feeling, and we should read and speak the Word according to burden and need.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the small groups there are no religious rituals or set practices such as first singing a hymn and then praying.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our hymn singing and praying should not be based on rituals but on our inspiration and feeling, and our reading and speaking of the Word should come out of a burden from the Lord and the needs of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Providing for Spiritual Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The gathering of the small group is for spiritual fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this fellowship there should be an emphasis on shepherding and teaching one another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There should be a mutual shepherding of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Someone asked me whether it was possible for sisters to shepherd brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During the time in a small group gathering, the sisters should forget that they are sisters and remember that they are members.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, at other times, when the gathering is concluded, it is good for the sisters to remember that they are sisters and not be so bold.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Boldness in a small group is welcome, but boldness in other situations can result in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The protection of a woman is to be hidden and to not assume the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But in a small group gathering, the sisters do not need to be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everyone can speak one to another in earnestness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, there is still a need for order.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The group gathering is a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the home young and old alike can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we come into a small group, we should be free to share our feelings and our needs with others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should also minister what we have received from the Lord to others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is to show care and concern for one other.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In big meetings it is difficult for us to have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, when seven or eight brothers and sisters gather as a small group, there is time for fellowship about many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can fellowship concerning our problems and burdens, having an intimate care for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since we are members one of another, we should share our joy as well as our sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This can be put into practice only in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before taking the way of the Lord s recovery, I attended Sunday services in a big chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After the service no one ever came to greet me, and I also did not seek out others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I knew many people by their last name, and many knew my name, but we never conversed with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not a normal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the church the brothers and sisters must know one another, bear difficulties together, and share in joy together.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, there is a need for the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we gather in groups for six months, we will feel the sweetness of the small group and enjoy an intimate supply from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This will edify all the saints.</S>
