   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE EIGHT THE WAYS THE SLAVE-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CARRIED OUT HIS GOSPEL SERVICE 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Mark 2:13-17</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that in 2:1 3:6 five incidents are recorded to show how the Slave-Savior as the Slave of God carried out His gospel service to care for the need of fallen people: forgiving the sins of the sick 2:1-12 , feasting with sinners 2:13-17 , causing His followers to be merry without fasting 2:18-22 , caring for His followers hunger rather than for religion s regulation 2:23-28 , and caring for the relief of the suffering one rather than for the ritual of religion 3:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have already considered the first incident, that of forgiving the sins of the sick.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we shall go on to consider the incident of the Lord s feasting with sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mark 2:13 says, And He went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd came to Him, and He taught them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that the Slave-Savior, as the light of the world John 8:12; 9:5 , came to Galilee, the land of darkness, where people were sitting in the shadow of death, and that He came as a great light to shine upon them Matt 4:12-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His teaching released the word of light to enlighten those in the darkness of death so that they might receive the light of life John 1:4 and be brought out of satanic darkness into the divine light Acts 26:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>FEASTING WITH SINNERS The Calling of Matthew</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 14 says, And passing by, He saw Levi the son of Alpheus, sitting at the tax office, and He says to him, Follow Me!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And rising up, he followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The tax office was a toll house, where tax was collected for the Roman government.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Levi, also known as Matthew, was one of the tax collectors, probably one in a high position Matt 10:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The tax collectors were condemned, despised, and abhorred by the Jews Luke 18:11; Matt 5:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Most of these tax collectors abused their office by demanding more than they should by false accusation Luke 3:12-13; 19:2, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To pay taxes to the Roman government was very bitter to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those engaged in collecting these taxes were despised by the people and counted unworthy of any respect Luke 18:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, they were classed with sinners Mark 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though Matthew was a tax collector, he was called by the Slave-Savior and later chosen and appointed as one of the twelve apostles 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The record of the calling of Matthew is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was a tax collector, one who was considered a traitor by the Jews because he helped the Roman imperialists.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the New Testament these tax collectors were classified with prostitutes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, such a person as Matthew was called by the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord simply said to him, Follow Me!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are told that Matthew rose and followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the record here, it seems that this was the first time the Lord met Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There must have been some attracting power with the Lord, either in His word or appearance, that caused Matthew to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To follow the Lord includes believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No one follows Him unless he believes in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To believe in the Lord is to be saved Acts 16:31 , and to follow Him is to enter the narrow gate and walk the constricted way Matt 7:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not the first case recorded in the Gospel of Mark of the Lord calling people to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1:16 He saw Simon and Andrew casting a net into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then He said to them, Come after Me, and I will make you become fishers of men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And immediately, leaving the nets, they followed Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Soon afterward, the Lord called James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in a boat mending nets v. 19 . When He called them, they left their father with the hired servants and followed Him v. 20 . We have a similar situation in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord saw Levi, or Matthew, at the tax office and told him to follow Him, and Matthew simply rose up and followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His action as an answer to the Slave-Savior s call implies his abandoning his unclean job and sinful life.</S>
