   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the morning, they brought the Lord Jesus before Pilate the governor, and Pilate asked the Lord, "You are the King of the Jews?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jesus answered, "Are you saying this of yourself, or did others tell you about Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Pilate said, "Am I a Jew?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Your nation and its chief priests have delivered You to me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What have You done?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling so that I would not be delivered to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not from here."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Pilate then said, "So then You are a king?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every one who is of the truth hears My voice."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Pilate then asked, "What is truth?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After Pilate said this, he did not wait for Jesus' answer but went out to the Jews and told them, "I find no fault in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was the Lord Jesus' testimony before Pilate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people think that the question of being the King of the Jews referred to the Lord becoming the King of the Jews then.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They think that it was a political question.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Bible shows that when Pilate asked the question, "Are You the King of the Jews?", the Lord Jesus responded by asking him about the source of his question.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the same as saying, "You have asked a question, but how much do you know about it?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is your understanding concerning it?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Does your question represent your own view, or is it just hearsay?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus did not hide from Pilate the fact that He was the King of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He testified that He was the King of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But His testimony was different from the accusation of His plotters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A king is always related to a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, He said, "My kingdom is not of this world."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since His kingdom is not of this world, His attendants did not need to fight for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If His kingdom had been of this world, there would have been a need for war.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His kingdom was from God and from above.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, there was no need to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Warfare in the flesh was unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was the King of the Jews and a King out of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It had nothing to do with world politics.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Among God's children, some only know the material world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They think that not being worldly means being unattached to material things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am not saying that we should be excessive with material things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the greatest matter relates to the source.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word "of" is fundamental.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"My kingdom is not of this world."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, it is not from this world and does not belong to this world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Among God's children, there are many things which seem spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if we trace their source, it is still the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although many terms are biblical, when we trace the source of their manifestation, it is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, we often say that humility is a virtue, and we admit that humility is something from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet the humility the Bible speaks of and the humility we have are not the same; this is where the problem lies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we trace the source of our humility, we often find that we are humble because we are trying to avoid certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are humble because we do not want to hurt others' feelings or invite others' criticisms.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This humility comes from diplomacy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A humility that issues from diplomacy can be considered only as a superficial virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But when we trace its source, we cannot say, "My kingdom is not of this world."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This kind of humility is of the world; it comes from a fear which is of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brothers and sisters, if a Christian lives according to God, he can be gentle and strong at the same time because he does not have any worldly considerations and fears.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's children often talk about being heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But what does it mean to be heavenly?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who are always in contact with heavenly things are not necessarily heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only that which comes from heaven is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the same way, what does it mean to be worldly?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It does not mean that a person who is in constant contact with the world is worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Being worldly means to come from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It does not mean that a person will not be worldly just by avoiding contact with the world and its things and affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Can you not be of this world simply by escaping from reality and changing your lifestyle?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No, this is not the meaning of being not of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are fundamentally of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is why we need God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When God's light shines in us, we will realize that much of our goodness has its source and rationale in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We do certain things because of certain reasons, and these reasons are of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All of our virtues are apparently spiritual, but actually this "spirituality" is of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They do not constitute a testimony, and there is no spiritual reality behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord Jesus says, "My kingdom is not of this world."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is reigning in a realm that is not of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His kingdom is entirely different from the kingdom of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, the question is not whether or not we have left the world but how many things in us are of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May the Lord be gracious to us and help us to not come under the influence of the world in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When the Lord Jesus came to the earth, He came to testify for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The hypocritical ones did not prefer light; instead, they preferred darkness because they did evil works; they wanted to do away with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But the Lord did not bow to the evil powers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When men reviled and accused Him, He did not answer, but when they came to the question of His person and His work, He made a good confession for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord traveled an uncommon pathway while He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In man's eyes He gained nothing, but He is now sitting at the right hand of Power, and He will come on the clouds of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All those who follow Him should pay attention to His testimony!</S>
