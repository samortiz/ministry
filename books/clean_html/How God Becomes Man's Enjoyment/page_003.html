<h2 class="head1">BASIC CONCEPTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Intention Being for Man<br />
to Eat the Fruit of the Tree of Life and<br />
to Drink the Water of Life</h2>
<p>Most people have the natural concept that God is great with glory, honor, and majesty, that He is far above the earth, and that man is a creature who must worship and serve Him respectfully. Although this concept is good, it is a natural human concept; it is not the divine thought. The natural concept is far from God&rsquo;s intention and is unacceptable to God, because it is not God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire for man.</p>
<p>In Genesis God created the heavens and the earth in five days, and He created man on the sixth day. Then He put man in the garden of Eden. The word <em>Eden</em> means pleasure. According to the natural thought, after putting man in the garden of Eden, God should have demanded that man bow down and worship Him.</p>
<p>When religion speaks of God, worship and service are involved. But the first thing that the Bible reveals concerning God&rsquo;s relationship with man is not man worshipping God but God putting man in a garden in front of a tree near a flowing river. God did not speak of having a desire for man to worship and serve Him or for man to do something. What the Bible reveals is completely different from the religious concept. God put man in front of the tree of life with a river next to it. This indicates that man was to eat the fruit of the tree of life and drink of the river. Hence, man&rsquo;s first responsibility before God is to have a proper attitude toward the tree of life and the river of water of life. Man&rsquo;s condition before God depends upon how man deals with the tree of life and the river of water of life. Man&rsquo;s condition depends on whether he eats the fruit of the tree and drinks of this river.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man Needing to Eat and Drink God<br />
in Order to Be Complete</h2>
<p>After God formed Adam from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, Adam became a living soul (Gen. 2:7). However, Adam was still not complete; God determined that Adam needed to eat and to drink. Adam had to eat and to drink in order to maintain his life. This is the principle that we live by today: in order to be healthy, a person needs to eat and to drink. Therefore, eating and drinking are indispensable to man.</p>
<p>What man eats and drinks are what he becomes. For example, people who always eat beef smell like beef. Hence, we must pay attention to what we eat. The Bible says that &ldquo;man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matt. 4:4), and it says that the Word is God (John 1:1). God did not tell Adam, &ldquo;If you worship and serve Me, you will live. In addition, you must love others and do good.&rdquo; Rather, God put Adam in front of the tree of life near a river. God wanted Adam to eat the fruit of this tree and to drink from the river so that he would live. The tree signifies Christ, and the river signifies the Spirit. Since God is in Christ and God is Spirit, He wants man to eat Him and drink Him, that is, to enjoy Him.</p>
<p>After God created man, He put Himself in front of man as the tree of life and the water of life in order for man to eat Him and drink Him. None of us is complete; we need God to supply us as food and make us complete. Without God as our food, life supply, and nourishment, we are incomplete. A person without God is an incomplete person, because he does not have life or satisfaction.</p>
<p>Every person has a body, a soul&mdash;which includes the mind, emotion, and will&mdash;and a spirit. Even a person who is highly educated has a sense that he lacks something. He does not lack material things; he lacks God. We need God to be our life, our nourishment, and our supply and thus to make us complete. A person without God is incomplete, deficient, and empty. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst&rdquo; (John 6:35). He also cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&rdquo; (7:37). These verses show that man is hungry and thirsty. Without God, man is deficient and incomplete. His life is incomplete because he lacks the eternal God.</p>
<p>A complete person is a person who gains God and enjoys God as his life supply and who lets God live in him. As a result, his disposition is desirable, his conduct is proper, and his life is complete. Such a person has been made complete by God.</p>
<p>God makes us complete by being our food and drink. A person cannot live without food and water; he must eat and drink daily. This shows God&rsquo;s intention in being the tree of life and the river of water of life. We need to eat and drink Him daily so that He can fill us and make us complete.</p>
