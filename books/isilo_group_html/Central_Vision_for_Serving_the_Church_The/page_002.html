<h1 class="title">REVELATION IN SPIRIT BEING NEEDED FOR SERVICE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL&rsquo;S ZEALOUS SERVICE TO GOD<br />
BEING IN OPPOSITION TO GOD</h2>
<p>Paul was not a Gentile; he did not worship idols or commit gross sins. He grew up in a God-seeking environment, and he was a God-seeker. He says, &ldquo;I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race&rdquo; (Gal. 1:14). Paul was more advanced, pious, zealous, and God-seeking than many of his contemporaries. He was so strong in his seeking of God that he was considered blameless in regard to the righteousness that is in the law (Phil. 3:6). According to morality and human culture, he was faultless. Paul did a top religious work in the top religious environment. However, according to 1 Timothy 1:13, Paul acknowledged that he had opposed God to the uttermost, being a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insulting person. Even the idolatrous and grossly sinning Gentiles did not oppose God as much as Paul did. He opposed not only God but also the church, which Christ gave Himself up for by shedding His blood (Gal. 1:13, 23; Eph. 5:25).</p>
<p>Although Paul&rsquo;s zealousness and earnestness in serving God were unparalleled, he opposed God to the uttermost. In Acts 22:3 Paul said that he &ldquo;trained at the feet of Gamaliel, according to the strictness of the law of our fathers.&rdquo; <em>Trained</em> in Greek means &ldquo;educated.&rdquo; Paul was born, raised, and educated in a God-seeking and God-serving environment. The names of idols were not in his mouth, and he committed no offenses or crimes with his hands. Everything he did was for God. Were it not for the light that shined on him from God, no one would be able to believe that such a one could be an opposer of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POSSIBILITY OF REPEATING PAUL&rsquo;S MISTAKES</h2>
<p>It is possible for us to repeat Paul&rsquo;s mistakes. We have been trained for many years in the church, and we serve more zealously than most Christians. Not only do we regard ourselves in this way, but even others have such a regard for us. Our situation is just like that of Paul, who was praised by his contemporaries. Certainly the priests and elders praised the young Paul, who was so promising, resolute, and able. The priests and elders surely were pleased that he was able to do so much. Nevertheless, Paul did not know that he was in darkness. Although we may be able to boast of our many years of training, our love for God, our service to God, and our absoluteness for God, we may be no different than Paul. Before he was saved, Paul thought that his persecution of the church and the things that he did contrary to the name of Jesus were part of his zealous service to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATAN USING MAN&rsquo;S PIETY AND ZEAL<br />
TO DESTROY GOD&rsquo;S MOVE</h2>
<p>Satan was the source of Paul&rsquo;s zealous service. When we say this, some religionists will argue that Satan does not want man to be zealous for God. No one questions Satan&rsquo;s influence on a person who indulges in going to theaters and nightclubs. But if a person zealously attends meetings, serves God, and is an elder in the church, no one would dare speak of this activity as being from Satan. However, the Bible indicates that it is possible to zealously serve God under Satan&rsquo;s influence.</p>
<p>In John 16:2 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;They will put you out of the synagogues; but an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.&rdquo; Although serving God may not be motivated by Satan, killing always comes from Satan. However, in this verse the Lord Jesus connected serving God with killing. Satan can motivate people, who believe that they are serving God, to kill. In other words, Satan can delude people into thinking that killing is a service to God.</p>
<p>According to the revelation of the Bible, our body, our flesh, is still under the authority of Satan. Therefore, no matter how pious or zealous we are, our piety or zeal may be of Satan. There is nothing that Satan cannot use. Satan can use the piety and zeal of the most pious and zealous person. Saul of Tarsus was used by Satan to the uttermost. Saul did not steal or commit fornication, and he kept the law to the extent that he was considered blameless in regard to the righteousness that is in the law. Nevertheless, he was used by Satan to the uttermost to destroy God&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>God became flesh in the man Jesus to accomplish His heart&rsquo;s desire (John 1:14). Yet Paul served God zealously and did many things contrary to the name of Jesus in order to overthrow this name (Acts 26:9). Paul wanted to eliminate the name of Jesus. This shows the extent to which he was deluded by Satan. We should not think that we can never be deluded. We may feel that we love God and that we are for the church, but our zeal for the church can be used by Satan in his efforts to destroy the church. In Paul&rsquo;s zealous service, he did many things contrary to the name of Jesus in order to overthrow His name, and he persecuted the church to the extent that he bound and delivered men and women to prison (8:3; 22:4). He even punished the believers in the synagogues (26:11), casting a vote against them when they were being done away with (v. 10).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Vision for Serving the Church &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
