   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD BEING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Speaking is surely a marvelous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to realize that not having the Word of God is equivalent to not having God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the Lord's mercy, since the day I was saved, I have loved the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For more than sixty years I have been reading the Bible every day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more I read it, the more I sense that the Bible is lovable and precious and that what has been written in it is so marvelous and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I spent eleven and a half years to reconsider every word in the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, comparing it with the Greek text.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I also made revisions to the English translation, and wherever possible I wrote footnotes for each verse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After these processes, my admiration and appreciation of the Bible have increased to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No man could have spoken such profound and mysterious words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only the Lord Jesus could have uttered such words to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The reason these words are so profound and mysterious is that the Word of God is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know that the words we speak are just ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For instance, our voice always represents us; this is a marvelous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although there are billions of people on the earth, there are not any two people who have exactly the same voice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In speaking, everyone has his own particular voice, tone, manner, and wording; even more, each is distinctly different in expression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After a person has given a message, no one else can duplicate it because the words of a person are just the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible says that God is the Word John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Apparently, the Bible does not directly say that God is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if we study the Greek text of the Bible or the English versions, we can see that John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here, the Word was God in Greek is "God was the Word."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether it is "God was the Word" or "the Word was God," they are actually the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, we can either say that Mr. Chen is Brother Chen or that Brother Chen is Mr. Chen; there is no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Saying that your wife is Mrs. Chang and saying that Mrs. Chang is your wife are both acceptable since both refer to her as your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Bible there is such a verse which says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a great verse showing us that the Word and God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Word is God, and God is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, we can say that man is the word, and the word is man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before this we might have never thought of ourselves as being the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although many animals can make certain vocal sounds, they cannot speak and do not have words.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only man has words; hence, man is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If someone wants to know what I am thinking within, he has to know it through my words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, when we come to the Bible, we come to God, because the Bible as the Word is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>GOD SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only is God the Word, but He also speaks; furthermore, He created men who speak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is the Word, but if He did not speak, He would not be the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because God is the Word, He speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may use a preacher as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The life of a preacher is a life of words because over the months and years he speaks unceasingly to people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The book of Hebrews tells us that our God is a speaking God; He not only spoke in old times, but He is still speaking today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Formerly, He spoke through the prophets to our forefathers; today He speaks to us in His Son, that is, in Himself, and He speaks to us from within us Heb 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus said to Philip, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works" John 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This shows us that the Lord Jesus' speaking was God's working.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, the Lord's speaking was God's speaking; the Lord and God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today our God is still speaking, and He speaks in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all are the members of the Body of His Son; thus, when we speak, it is God speaking in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we preach the gospel, it is God speaking in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Speaking can cause things, even big things, to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the people of the world do business, their success or failure depends on whether or not they know how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before going out, a salesperson has to be taught and trained in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who know how to talk will get the business, and those who talk improperly or inadequately will not get the business.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes talking too much will also cause a salesperson to lose business.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, all the successful salespeople are able to speak and know how to speak very well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Actually, interaction in human society depends on speaking; moreover, the speaking must be proper and suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, speaking causes things to happen, and it can greatly affect the outcome of a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today our working for the Lord also depends on speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we speak well, people will be saved; if we speak poorly, people will not understand the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we speak well, people will be edified; if we speak poorly, our work will be futile.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is a Chinese proverb which says, "A word can cause a nation to rise; a word can cause a nation to fall."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It means that the rise or fall of a nation can depend on man's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all acknowledge that God's creation of the universe was a great act.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yet this great act was accomplished by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Genesis 1:3 says, "And God said, Let there be light; and there was light."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whatever God spoke came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, in the Psalms the psalmist praised God, saying, "For He spoke, and it was; / He commanded, and it stood" 33:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If God had not spoken anything, then it would have been impossible for the universe to come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even our existence depends to a great extent on God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus said, "He who hears My word and believes has eternal life" John 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our being saved and our receiving the eternal life are altogether dependent upon the Lord's word.</S>
