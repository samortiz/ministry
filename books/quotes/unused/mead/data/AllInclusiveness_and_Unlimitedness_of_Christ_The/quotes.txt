[1]  CONTENTS In What He Is In His Work In His Multiplication and Increase In His Riches and Fullness In His Living Out and Testimony
[2]  CHAPTER ONE IN WHAT HE IS Scripture Reading: Exo 3:2-6, 14-15; John 8:24, 28, 58; 1:1, 14; 1 Tim 3:16; Heb 2:14a; Col 2:9; John 19:5-6; Heb 2:9; Col 1:20; 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 8:3; 1 John 1:7; Heb 9:12; John 12:24 OUTLINE Jehovah God in eternity the Creator: The self-existing and ever-existing Jehovah the eternal, great I Am Exo 3:14; John 8:24, 28, 58.
[3]  The sin-bearing God-man in His vicarious death the Redeemer: As the One who is both God and man, passing through death in His humanity with His divinity John 19:5-6.
[4]  As we all know, the center of the Bible is Christ.
[5]  When speaking about Christ, whether it be in what He is, in what He has accomplished, in His person, in His work, or in any other aspect, the Bible always shows us that He is all-inclusive and infinite.
[6]  From all the revelations in the Scriptures, we can see that there are three great aspects of Christ.
[7]  As we have said, the general subject of these messages is the all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness of Christ.
[8]  B. The Triune God the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
[9]  B. Being a Man of Blood and Flesh Who Was Born of Blood and Flesh, Possessing the Perfect Human Nature
[10]  This Christ is the complete God according to His divine nature and the perfect man according to His human nature.
[11]  He is the complete God mingled with the perfect man.
[12]  C. Being One Who Is Both God and Man a God-man a Mingling of the Divine Nature with the Human Nature, without a Third Nature Being Produced D. Being the Embodiment of the Fullness of the Godhead of the Complete God
[13]  I hope that you, brothers and sisters, will apply the effort to study so that you may know how the Lord Jesus as God is all-inclusive and unlimited and how He as a man is also all-inclusive and unlimited.
[14]  However, because as the God-man the Lord Jesus was God mingled with man, and since God is all-inclusive and unlimited, the Lord Jesus as such a man was also all-inclusive and unlimited.
[15]  C. As a Man of Flesh, Being Made Sin on Behalf of Man and Condemning Sin in the Flesh
[16]  The Bible says clearly in 2 Corinthians 5:21 that Him who did not know sin God made sin on our behalf.
[17]  CHAPTER TWO IN HIS WORK Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim 3:16; Luke 24:19; Acts 2:22; 10:38-39; 1 Pet 2:24; 3:18; Heb 2:9; Acts 13:33; 1 Pet 1:3; 2 Pet 1:4; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:6b; Acts 2:36; Eph 1:22, 10; Acts 2:33 OUTLINE Being incarnated to bring God into man that divinity and humanity may be mingled as one John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim 3:16.
[18]  Passing through human living to live the human life in His humanity with His divinity Luke 24:19; Acts 2:22; 10:38-39.
[19]  Dying for the creation to taste death on behalf of all creation in His humanity with His divinity 1 Pet 2:24; 3:18; Heb 2:9.
[20]  In this message we want to go on and look further at how all-inclusive and unlimited He is in His work, that is, in His doings, actions, and moves.
[21]  Since our Lord is all-inclusive and unlimited, His work surely is also all-inclusive and unlimited.
[22]  However, the Bible speaks about His work, His move, His doings, and His words and deeds, which all constitute His living, in a rich and detailed way in chapter after chapter.
[23]  Today, because of the convenience in transportation and the developments in communication, the globe seems to be much smaller.
[24]  However, if we say that as the saved ones we have been born of God to be His children and that we possess His Spirit and His life but not His nature, this is also a wrong teaching because 2 Peter 1:4 tells us clearly that God has made us partakers of His divine nature.
[25]  I. BEING INCARNATED TO BRING GOD INTO MAN THAT DIVINITY AND HUMANITY MAY BE MINGLED AS ONE
[26]  This work began with the Lord Jesus becoming flesh, which is called His incarnation.
[27]  Gradually, after I gained some experience in my study of the Bible and through the use of Bible expositions written throughout the centuries, I finally understood that the Holy Spirit of whom Jesus was conceived was the essential Spirit for His living, and the Holy Spirit who descended upon Jesus after His baptism was the economical Spirit for His work.
[28]  Not only so, but once He passed through human living, He went one great step further to die for the creation.
[29]  If you study the Bible carefully, you can see that when the Lord Jesus was in Galilee, He went hurriedly to Jerusalem because the Passover was approaching.
[30]  First, He was the Lamb of God; second, He was a man in the flesh; third, He was the One signified by the bronze serpent; fourth, He was the last Adam; fifth, He was the Firstborn of all creation; sixth, He was the Peacemaker and the peace; and seventh, He was also a grain of wheat.
[31]  In God's eyes, when Christ was resurrected, not only He alone was resurrected, but all of us who have been chosen and counted by God to be in Christ were also resurrected together with Him.
[32]  Just as in His death He brought all of us with Him to pass through death, so also in His resurrection from the dead He brought us out of death into resurrection.
[33]  Therefore, Ephesians 2:6 says that God raised us up together with Christ and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies.
[34]  CHAPTER THREE IN HIS MULTIPLICATION AND INCREASE Scripture Reading: John 12:24; Luke 12:50; Rom 8:3; Eph 2:15; 1 Pet 3:18; 1:3; 1 Cor 12:12, 27; 10:17; John 3:30 OUTLINE As the divine grain of wheat John 12:24 He being constrained in the shell of His flesh Luke 12:50.
[35]  Through His all-inclusive death He dying in His fleshly shell Rom 8:3; Eph 2:15.
[36]  While He was dying in His fleshly shell, He growing in His divine life and entering into resurrection 1 Pet 3:18.
[37]  It acknowledged the Bible, it acknowledged God, and it also acknowledged that the Lord Jesus was the Son of God who became a man, that He died on the cross for sinners, that He was resurrected from the dead, and that He ascended to heaven.
[38]  If you investigate, you will see that much of the terminology which we use today is definitely not found in Christian theology.
[39]  Because no one speaks about this, most of today's Christians consider the Bible the divine revelation as a religious classic.
[40]  They may say, "As a wife who fears God, you must behave properly by submitting to your husband that you may glorify God.
[41]  THE WORKS WHICH THE LORD ACCOMPLISHED IN HIS PROCESSES
[42]  We have to see that our Lord is not the founder of a religion but One who died and resurrected.
[43]  From the time of His incarnation to the time of His ascension, He did a number of great works.
[44]  WE BEING THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST CONSTITUTING HIS BODY AS HIS INCREASE
[45]  When we believed in the Lord Jesus and called upon His name, we received the Lord Jesus into us.
[46]  CHAPTER FOUR IN HIS RICHES AND FULLNESS Scripture Reading: Col 2:9; John 1:16; Eph 3:8; John 16:15; Eph 1:23; 4:13; 3:19b, 21 OUTLINE All the fullness of the Godhead of the Triune God dwelling in Him bodily Col 2:9.
[47]  His unsearchable riches Eph 3:8 including all that the Father has John 16:15 , all that He is, and all that He has experienced and accomplished.
[48]  His fullness being His Body as His expression, which is the fullness, the expression, of the Triune God Eph 3:19b.
[49]  Of course, the church here is not the church as ordinarily understood by Christians today.
[50]  You cannot say that the whites who believe in the Lord Jesus are not called by God, nor can you say that the blacks who believe in the Lord Jesus are not called by God.
[51]  I have spoken these things to show you what the church is.
[52]  The church is the Body of Christ, which is the fullness of Christ.
[53]  If each one of us is full of Christ within, each one lives Christ, and each can say, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me," then within we all have arrived at the full measure of the stature of the Body of Christ.
[54]  Now I want to speak a little on what the riches of Christ are.
[55]  Today the pastors and preachers in Christianity mostly say that Christ, who is the Son of God, was incarnated, and because He loved sinners, He died for us on the cross, resurrected on the third day, and then ascended to heaven.
[56]  What they say is right, but it does not give people the impression that Christ is rich and that His riches are unsearchable.
[57]  ENJOYING THE RICHES OF CHRIST BY PRAY-READING THE WORD AND PRAYING INTO THE SPIRIT
[58]  On the one hand, He is the Lord and Christ on the throne in heaven, while on the other hand, He is the life-giving Spirit who has entered into us to be our life.
[59]  This all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwelling and living in the countless members whom He has regenerated Gal 2:20a; 2 Tim 4:22.
[60]  We living Him out by the bountiful supply of this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit Phil 1:19-21a as His witnesses and testimony Acts 1:8; Rev 1:9.
[61]  ENJOYING THE INCLUSIVENESS AND UNLIMITEDNESS OF CHRIST BY THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST
[62]  However, he said in Philippians 1:19 that he knew that his suffering would turn out for him to salvation because of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[63]  The Spirit of Jesus Christ is not only the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of Jesus and the Spirit of Christ.
