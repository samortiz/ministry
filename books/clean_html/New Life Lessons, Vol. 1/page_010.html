<h2 class="head1">IV. THE PRACTICE OF PREACHING<br />
THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>1. PRAY&mdash;BRINGING PEOPLE TO GOD</p>
<p>First, make a list of all the names of relatives, friends, schoolmates, colleagues, and contacts for whom the Lord has burdened you. Then pray for them one by one until they are saved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">* PRAY IN FAITH</h2>
<p>Faith is to receive God&rsquo;s promise without doubting during our prayer. Since it is God who desires that we pray, He has to answer our prayers. He said:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.&rdquo;</strong>  Matthew 7:7</p>
<p>2. PREACH&mdash;BRINGING GOD TO MAN</p>
<p><strong>(1) The principle</strong></p>
<p>The principle of preaching the gospel is to spread from Jerusalem to the remotest part of the earth, from the center to the circumference. For this reason, our preaching should start with our close relatives and friends and continue to spread out.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them the things the Lord has done to you, and how He has had mercy on you.&rdquo;</strong>  Mark 5:19</p>
<p>Please remember these points:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Continue in a spirit of prayer.</li>
<li>Have a sincere and earnest attitude.</li>
<li>Present the truth wisely.</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary debates.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(2) Preach in season and out of season</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.&rdquo;</strong>  2 Timothy 4:2</p>
<p>Whenever an opportunity arises and you meet some people, you should follow the inner feeling and speak to them.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Distribute tracts</strong></p>
<p>Keep gospel tracts handy and pass them out at every opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>(4) Contact people regularly</strong></p>
<p>Schedule appropriate times, preferably one to two hours a week, for contacting people and preaching the gospel.</p>
<p><strong>(5) Invite people to come to hear the gospel</strong></p>
<p>By means of phone calls, letters, or invitations, contact at scheduled times those for whom you pray according to the list you made, inviting them to some meetings. You can also give them some Bibles, gospel booklets, or tracts.</p>
<p>Dear saint, since you have believed in the Lord, don&rsquo;t you desire to be the Lord&rsquo;s witness?</p>
<p>Put down twelve names of your close relatives, friends, and schoolmates:</p>
<p>      </p>
<p>      </p>
<p>      </p>
<p>      </p>
<p>      </p>
<p>      </p>
<p>If you will pray for them with faith and persevere in preaching the gospel, in due time you will bear fruit and glorify God.</p>
