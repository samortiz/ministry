<P>In His word to the Pharisees, the Lord revealed that Satan has his kingdom (Matt. 12:26). There is another kingdom besides the kingdom of God. Today the situation is exactly the same in principle. Although some may worship God in name and in form, actually they are joined with Satan and are serving Satan. They think they are in the kingdom of God; actually, they are in the kingdom of Satan. Even while they are worshipping God, it is possible for them to be in the kingdom of Satan. They may think that they are working for the kingdom of God, yet unknowingly be working for the kingdom of Satan.</P><P>We need to see these two kingdoms&#151;the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan. Eventually, the kingdom of God will swallow up the kingdom of Satan. When he was created by God, Adam was innocent. God placed Adam before two trees which denoted two sources: God and Satan. God's intention in creating man was to establish the kingdom. According to the Bible, the ultimate consummation of God's work is a kingdom. In the Bible, a house represents a family, and a city represents a kingdom. In eternity there will not be a house but a city&#151;New Jerusalem. The Apostle John said that he saw no temple in the city (Rev. 21:22). The temple will be enlarged to become the city, and the city represents the kingdom. Eventually, God will establish His kingdom.</P><P>How will God establish His kingdom? When we hear the word "establish," we may think it means to assemble various pieces or elements together, placing one next to the other. However, this is not God's way. God's way is to put Himself into man as life. This life will grow in us until it produces the kingdom.</P><P>Before God could get into man, Satan entered into man in a very subtle way. Satan, like all deceivers, was a good talker. By his subtle speaking he indoctrinated man with his thoughts. He injected his evil thoughts into the human mind. The principle is the same today. Whenever you accept a certain thought, then you may act upon it. The thought comes first, then the action. The thoughts people take in eventually influence their behavior. After Satan had injected his evil thoughts into the human mind, man exercised his body to take the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil into him.</P>
