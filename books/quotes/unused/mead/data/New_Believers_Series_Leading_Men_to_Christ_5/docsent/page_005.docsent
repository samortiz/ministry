   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOING TO MAN ON GOD'S BEHALF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Merely going to God on man's behalf is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We also have to go to man on God's behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to tell men about God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people have the courage to speak to God, but they have no courage to speak to man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to exercise boldness to speak to men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to tell them the kind of Lord our Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we speak, we need to pay attention to a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Never Engaging in Useless Arguments</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, never engage in useless arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This does not mean that there should never be any arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Acts tells us of a few arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even Paul argued cf.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Acts 17:2, 17-18; 18:4, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, useless arguments do not save people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes it is all right to engage in arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But this is mainly for the benefit of other listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Try to avoid arguing with the ones you are trying to save because arguments often drive people away instead of bringing them in. If you argue with them, they will run away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many people think that arguments can touch men's hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, this never happens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the most, arguments can convince men's minds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their mouths may be shut, but their hearts will not be won over.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Arguments produce little result.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Try to say less in the way of argument and more in the way of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have only to tell others that you felt happy and peaceful after you believed in the Lord Jesus, that you sleep well now, and that even meals are becoming tastier.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one can argue with you about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They can only wonder.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to show them that they do not have your kind of peace and joy and that they should therefore believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>B. Keeping to the Facts</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The key to leading men to the Lord is to emphasize the facts, not the doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Just recall what it was like when you were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You did not believe because you understood the doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people understand the doctrines, but they do not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is impossible for any brother to try to lead others to Christ through arguments and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The key to leading men to Christ is to keep to the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why simple ones often are more effective in leading others to the Lord; those who are good at doctrines may not lead others to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some people can give wonderful messages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But what use is there in winning the minds of others, if one cannot help them be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once there was an old man who considered going to church a good habit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was not saved, yet he would go to church every Sunday and also make his whole family go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But when he returned home, he would lose his temper, and all kinds of bad words would come out of his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The whole family was afraid of him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day his daughter, who was a believer, came to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She brought her little daughter with her.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The old man brought the little granddaughter to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When they came out of the church, the little granddaughter looked at her grandfather and felt that he did not look like a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She asked him, "Do you believe in Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The grandfather said, "Children should keep their mouths shut."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After walking a few steps, she said to her grandfather again, "You do not look as if you have believed in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Again the old man said, "Children should keep their mouths shut."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After a while she asked her grandfather, "Why do you not believe in Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This little child saw a fact the way her grandfather attended church was different from the way other believers attended church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The old man, who was otherwise wild and hard to deal with, became soft after his little granddaughter's probing questions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On that day he accepted the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The preaching of the gospel requires skill.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One must know the way God works before he can preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A person may preach the right doctrines, and crowds of people may come for his messages, but the same crowds may walk away unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You will not get any fish with a straight hook.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The fishing hook must be curved before one can catch fish.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who lead others to the Lord need to know how to use a hook.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Use only the words that can catch people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If your words cannot catch people, try to change the way you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Facts are words that catch; they are words that can touch others.</S>
