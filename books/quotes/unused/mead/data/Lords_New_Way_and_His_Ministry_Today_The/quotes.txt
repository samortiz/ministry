[1]  THE LORD'S NEW WAY AND HIS MINISTRY TODAY Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor 14:26; Matt 28:18-20; 1 Tim 2:4; 1 Cor 3:6, 9; Acts 14:23; 1 Tim 3:15-16 Hymns, 132, 548 THE PRACTICE OF TODAY'S CHRISTIANITY VERSUS WHAT IS REVEALED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[2]  The Lord needs a new way because Christianity presents us something different from what is revealed in the New Testament.
[3]  Within the past three months, seven hundred full-time trainees in Taipei have knocked on the doors of about one hundred fifty thousand homes in the city of Taipei, which has over five hundred thousand homes.
[4]  We must cooperate with the Lord to carry out these four things knocking on people's doors to get them to believe and be baptized, teaching them the truths, ministering life to them that they may grow in the measure of Christ, and helping them to practice the church life.
[5]  We will continue the training in Taipei for another four months to study these further steps: how to teach people the truth in their home meetings, how to minister life that they may grow in Christ in their home meetings, and even to bring their home meetings into the full practice of the church life.
[6]  We need to preach the gospel to save sinners not by superficial or superstitious gospel preaching.
[7]  We must preach the high gospel, the gospel on the highest plane, telling people that man was made in God's image to be His vessel to contain Him, that man has to take God as his life to live by Him that man might be God's expression, representing Him on this earth.
[8]  ONE OUT OF TWENTY JOB-DROPPING FULL-TIMERS AND ONE OUT OF FOUR WEEKLY DOOR KNOCKERS
[9]  We hope that all the churches today around the globe in the Lord's recovery will practice to have one out of twenty saints as a job-dropping full-timer.
[10]  If your church has one hundred saints meeting together, five full-timers should be produced.
[11]  If there are one hundred saints in your locality, five should be job-dropping full-timers who knock on doors five days a week and twenty-five saints should be weekly door knockers.
[12]  If we take this way, the Lord will have a living testimony, not a church life in big halls but the church life practiced in many homes.
