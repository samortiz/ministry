   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After the children of Israel entered Canaan, God repeatedly blessed them, giving them rest all around and enabling them to live in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At that time, considering the question of a dwelling place for God, David their king said, "I dwell in a house of cedar, but the Ark of God dwells within curtains" 2 Sam 7:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In light of this, he decided to build a house for God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, God in effect told him, "Do not rush!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I will first build a house for you, out of which a son will come forth, and it is he who will build a house for Me. I must first build you a house, and then you can do it for Me."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a great spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one can do things for God first.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God always does things for man first, and then after this man can do things for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God never asks anything from you when your hands are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God always gives to you first, and then asks a little from you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This may be likened to a father who first gives his child a bag of candy, and then asks the child for one piece of candy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, sometimes the father is treated very pitifully, because even though he has already given the child a bag of candy, when he asks for only one piece of candy, the child puts his hands behind his back.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this situation the father has no other way except to bring out another bag of candy and tell the child, "If you give me a piece, I will give you another bag."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After some calculation, the child considers it quite a bargain to give one piece and get another bag, so he is willing to give his father a piece of candy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the father will have to prepare a third bag if he wants to ask the child for another piece.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the father does not have the third bag of candy, the child will not give him the second piece of candy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, there is always a similar difficulty whenever God asks us for something.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, I can tell you that if God asks you for something, He has a "second bag" already prepared for you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, He not only has a second bag, but He has prepared an unlimited number of bags.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You can be at peace because God never asks anything from you when you are empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, He always gives to you before asking anything from you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That day when David first wanted to build a house for God, even Nathan the prophet, who knew God, did not understand this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, he said to David, "All that is in your heart go and do, for Jehovah is with you" v. 3 . Then God came to Nathan immediately and told him, "No! Go and tell David that he cannot build Me a house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I must first build him a house, and afterward a son will come out of that house, and then that son will build Me a house."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually when Solomon was born, he did build a temple for God, and the glory of God filled it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That temple, however, was still only a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as God did not dwell in the tabernacle, He also did not dwell in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, God considered the children of Israel to be His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the condition of the children of Israel before God was normal, God dwelt among them, and that temple was filled with the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the children of Israel were in desolation before God, God could no longer dwell in their midst, and the glory of God also left the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the temple was only a sign, a symbol.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The real temple was the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God did not dwell in a house made of stones; instead, He dwelt among the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, God said in Isaiah, "Heaven is My throne, / And the earth the footstool for My feet.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>/ Where then is the house that you will build for Me, / And where is the place of My rest?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>/ But to this kind of man will I look, to him who is poor / And of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word" 66:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as heaven is not God's dwelling place, so the house on earth is not His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He looks to a group of people into whom He can enter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, God spoke through Isaiah, "For thus says the high and exalted One, / Who inhabits eternity, / I will dwell in the high and holy place, / And with the contrite and lowly of spirit" 57:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These words clearly show us that the heavens and the earth are not the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The dwelling place that God wants to have is a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If God does not gain a group of people, then He will be a God without a home in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, He longs to gain a group of people so that they can be built together to be His dwelling place.</S>
