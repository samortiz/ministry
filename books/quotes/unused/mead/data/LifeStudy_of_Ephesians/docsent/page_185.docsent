   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FIRM FOUNDATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 15 says, And having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our feet must be shod in order to strengthen our stand in the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not for walking a way or running a course, but for fighting the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The phrase the firm foundation of the gospel of peace means the establishment of the gospel of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ has made peace for us on the cross, both with God and with man, and this peace has become our gospel 2:13-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness for our feet to be shod with.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, we shall have a firm footing that we may stand to fight the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The peace for such a firm foundation is also Christ 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Most translations render the Greek here as readiness or preparation rather than firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Readiness or preparation indicates preparedness to put on shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many readers of Ephesians think that in verse 15 Paul is charging us to be always ready and prepared to put on the shoes of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this is an incorrect understanding derived from an inaccurate translation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to understand Paul s thought in this verse, we need to see that here the gospel is not the gospel of grace, nor the gospel of the forgiveness of sins, nor even the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here the gospel is the gospel of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to 2:15 and 16, on the cross Christ accomplished peace so that the Gentiles can contact the Jewish believers and so that we all can contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This peace is glad tidings, good news.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, it is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, 2:17 says that Christ preached the gospel of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also must preach this peace as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The gospel of peace spoken of in 6:15 is the peace accomplished by Christ on the cross for us to be one with God and for the Gentile believers to be one with the Jewish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This peace is our gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With this peace there is preparation, readiness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Greek word actually means a firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This firm foundation is a secure footing for our standing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the peace accomplished by Christ on the cross is a firm footing, a firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we fight against the evil powers, the peace Christ has accomplished is a firm foundation for our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To take part in the spiritual warfare, our feet must be shod with this firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the past most of us thought that the shoes of the gospel were for us to walk or to run in our preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the firm foundation of the gospel of peace is not for running, but for standing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For running we may have a pair of lightweight shoes, but for standing we need a pair of sturdy shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In fighting, the crucial thing is to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must be able to stand and to withstand the attacks of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who are defeated will run, but those who are victorious will stand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we wrestle against the enemy, we shall find that Satan does not run away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even when we are victorious over him, he keeps on wrestling with us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore we need to be able to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Spiritual warfare is not a boxing match, but a wrestling match.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we would wrestle against the enemy, we need a firm footing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah, in the Lord s recovery we have such a foundation!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because there are those who have their feet shod with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, they can withstand any attack of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because they have such a firm footing, nothing can shake them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No matter what happens, they can stand and withstand in the evil day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Usually peace is the opposite of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we have peace, we do not fight, and when we fight, we do not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But here we fight with peace and in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We fight by standing in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we lose the peace between us and God or between us and other believers, we lose the standing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is the peace for us to be one with God and to be one with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This peace is the firm foundation that enables us to stand fast against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The three aspects of the armor of God covered in this message the girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, and the firm foundation of the gospel of peace are all Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is our truth, our righteousness, and our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ is God expressed and revealed, Christ is the righteous element that covers us, and Christ is the peace that enables us to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, we can stand in peace to fight the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we would be victorious in the spiritual warfare, we need Christ as our girdle of truth, as our breastplate of righteousness, and as our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By means of such a Christ we have the strength, the covering, and the firm footing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we are able to fight against the enemy.</S>
