        <h2 class="head1">LOVING THE LORD TO RECEIVE REVELATION<br />
CONCERNING HIM</h2>
<p>There is an issue to having a loving heart and a loving response to the Lord. Something happens to those who love the Lord. Every lover of the Lord gains new knowledge, a new revelation. The disciples knew that the Lord had died and was buried, but they did not understand that He would rise from the dead. Their knowledge of the Lord included His death and burial. Peter and John knew the Lord only in His death and burial. Therefore, they could speak about the Lord being born in a manger, preaching, performing miracles, teaching crowds, manifesting His love, and being crucified and buried in a tomb.</p>
<p>Mary the Magdalene was a sister who loved the Lord, and the Lord gave her a discovery because she loved Him. Mary saw that the stone was taken away from the tomb (v. 1) and thought that someone had taken the Lord out of the tomb. Hence, she ran to tell Peter and John (v. 2). Because she had a new discovery, new knowledge, she had a new truth to proclaim and a new revelation to convey to others. Others had old truth concerning the Lord Jesus, but only Mary received new revelation. This new revelation came from her love for the Lord. A person who loves the Lord will receive new knowledge concerning the Lord. If we love the Lord more than others, we will surely know Him more than others. There were many disciples, but no one saw the Lord&rsquo;s empty tomb before Mary the Magdalene did, because she loved the Lord very much. She must have felt perplexed when she saw the empty tomb and asked why He was gone. As soon as she made this new discovery, she went to tell Peter and John.</p>
<p>After hearing Mary&rsquo;s story, the two brothers realized that this was something new and immediately ran to see (v. 3). Their love for the Lord was not as burning as Mary&rsquo;s love for the Lord, but they still loved the Lord; they were not indifferent. The two disciples ran, but one was faster and the other was slower. John, who arrived first at the tomb, did not go in but waited for Peter, who arrived second, to enter the tomb (vv. 4-6). These two disciples were pursuing the Lord together, but one was ahead and the other was behind. John was ahead but was satisfied to reach the mark. Peter was behind but continued to move forward. Thus, the first became the last, and the last became the first. These details portray our own pursuit of the Lord.</p>
<p>Mary and the two disciples pursued the Lord. Mary was ahead but was afraid of entering into the tomb. She needed the help of Peter and John. They were bolder and entered directly into the tomb to investigate. However, they were clear as soon as they stepped into the tomb. They saw the linen cloths lying there and the handkerchief, which had been over His head, folded apart from the linen cloths (vv. 6-7), and they immediately knew that the Lord had resurrected. It was very clear. The disciples saw and believed (v. 8). But because they did not yet understand the Scripture, that the Lord had to rise from the dead, they went away again to their own home (vv. 9-10). These two disciples had a clear mind, but their love was not hot; therefore, they were satisfied with seeing the empty tomb. Mary, however, loved the Lord so much that she was not satisfied with seeing the empty tomb. She still wanted to find her Lord.</p>
<p>Loving the Lord is a strength of the sisters. Mary loved the Lord, saw the empty tomb, but was not satisfied. She wanted to see the Lord. The tomb was empty, and it was obvious that the Lord had resurrected. The disciples should have celebrated and rejoiced. But Mary loved the Lord so much that it was painful for her to not be able to find the Lord. It was as if she would rather have seen the Lord&rsquo;s dead body than know that He had resurrected. Because she yearned to see the Lord, she stood outside at the tomb and wept (v. 11). Her action seems to be very foolish, but it indicates that she was truly attracted by the Lord&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Mary, a foolish lover of the Lord, not only found the empty tomb but also gained the fresh appearing of the Lord Jesus after resurrection. After rising from the dead, the Lord appeared to Mary first, even before He ascended into the presence of the Father (vv. 14, 17). Mary was the first person in the universe to taste the freshness of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. The Lord appeared to her because she loved Him desperately; the Lord had no choice but to appear to her. The Lord was supposed to ascend to God immediately after His resurrection, but because of Mary&rsquo;s desperate love for Him, He had no choice but to appear to her. Hence, our love for the Lord results in our receiving new revelations and making new discoveries concerning the Lord. By loving the Lord, we can gain His fresh appearing. Those who are clear-minded do not have this kind of experience.</p>
<p>I have met some intelligent, highly educated, and knowledgeable scientists and philosophers. They can converse freely on any subject matter, but they are confounded when it comes to the things of the Lord Jesus. I have also met successful businessmen who are knowledgeable and full of insight in matters related to running a business. They are genuine believers in the Lord, but they are confounded when it comes to the things of the Lord Jesus. There are also some older sisters in the church who are illiterate and uneducated, but they love the Lord very much. They do not understand philosophy or science, nor do they know how to run a business, but they genuinely understand the things of the Lord Jesus and spiritual principles. They are completely different from the brothers. These sisters have spiritual understanding. They may not read the Bible, but what they say about the verses that they know is full of light and life. The Lord is very intimate with them. Their spiritual understanding is the result of their pure love for the Lord.</p>
<p>When a person loves the Lord, his spiritual understanding is opened. Hence, those who love the Lord receive new revelations and make new discoveries of the Lord. No one thought to look for the Lord Jesus after His resurrection, but Mary was the first person to see Him. When Mary met the Lord, she did not know that it was the Lord. The person she was looking for stood in front of her and said, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?&rdquo; (v. 15). She heard the Lord&rsquo;s voice but did not recognize Him. She was blinded by love. Supposing that the person speaking with her was a gardener, she said, &ldquo;Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away&rdquo; (v. 15). Mary was speaking with the resurrected Lord, but she did not seem to know Him. A genuine seeker of the Lord will see light and receive revelation, but he may not think that he sees light or that he has received revelation. This is a genuine experience of seeing light and receiving revelation. Some people proclaim loudly that they have seen great light, when in fact they have not seen anything. If we see something but doubt what we have seen, we may have received light and revelation.</p>
<p>Mary was blinded until Jesus said, &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; Then she turned and said to Him in Hebrew, &ldquo;Rabboni!&rdquo; (v. 16). Mary must have recognized the Lord&rsquo;s voice when He called her name. She had heard Him call her name for the past three years. Hence, she knew that it was the Lord and wanted to touch Him. However, the Lord said to her, &ldquo;Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God&rdquo; (v. 17). After His resurrection and before ascending to the Father and presenting the freshness of His resurrection to the Father, the Lord Jesus appeared first to Mary, who loved Him. Then the Lord charged Mary to go to the brothers and tell them what He had said to her.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
