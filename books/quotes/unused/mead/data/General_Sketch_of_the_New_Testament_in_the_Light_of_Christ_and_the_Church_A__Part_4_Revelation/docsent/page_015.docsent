   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN THE SEVENTH TRUMPET Scripture Reading: Rev 10 11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The great tribulation will be a period of three and a half years Dan 7:25; 12:7; Rev 12:14 , which is forty-two months 11:2; 13:5 , or twelve hundred and sixty days 11:3; 12:6 , which is the last half of the last week in Daniel 9:24-27, beginning from the sixth seal, very close in time to the first five trumpets Rev 6:12-17; 8:7 9:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A certain kind of tribulation on the earth will have begun before this time, but not in an intensified way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have seen, the second through fourth seals are a picture of the damage occurring from the time of the Lord s ascension to the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These damages are natural calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the sixth seal, however, there is a sudden supernatural change in the signs in the heavens the sun, the moon, and the stars and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At this time, the Lord begins to sound an alarm to the people on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He warns them that this earth is not trustworthy, and because the Lord will shake this earth, they should not become settled in it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The earthquake of the sixth seal is the beginning of the supernatural calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the sixth seal, there are the four trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first trumpet damages the third part of the earth and the trees, the second trumpet damages the third part of the sea and the things in it, the third trumpet damages the third part of the springs and rivers, and the fourth trumpet damages the third part of the sun, the moon, and the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God intends these four trumpets to be a warning to the people on the earth not to trust it and settle down on it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, although God will shake the earth and judge the third part of the earth, the sea, the fresh waters, and the things in the heavens, there will not yet be any direct injury to human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this way, the sixth seal and the first four trumpets are only alarms, warning those people dwelling on this earth that they need to repent before God, turn from the earth, and seek God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Following this warning, the tribulation will be intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By the time of the fifth trumpet, Satan will have been defeated in heaven and cast out of heaven to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then he will do whatever he can to damage the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan will open the pit of the abyss to release the multitude of evil things, the demon-possessed locusts with tails like scorpions who sting men s bodies and cause suffering for five months.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We cannot realize such a thing because we have never experienced it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sixth trumpet brings even more intensified tribulation two hundred million horsemen who kill the third part of men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At this point, one third of the earth, one third of the sea, one third of the fresh waters, and one third of the heavens have been damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now, because men would not be warned by the first four trumpets but continue to do things against God, one third of the population is cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the time of the fifth trumpet Satan is cast to the earth, and at the same time Antichrist rises from the abyss to be the king of the evil things from the pit of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moreover, the fifth trumpet as the first woe has something of scorpions 9:10 , whereas the sixth trumpet as the second woe has something of serpents v. 19 . The Lord Jesus mentioned both serpents and scorpions in Luke 10:19.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The serpent represents Satan, and scorpions are related to serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that during the time of the fifth and sixth trumpets, Satan will come down to this earth, and along with his incarnation, Antichrist, he will damage the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These facts make it clear that the great tribulation of three and a half years will be intensified at the time of the fifth and sixth trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then, after the sixth trumpet, something even more serious occurs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The wrath of God will be exhausted in the seven bowls which will intensify the fearful damage and calamities.</S>
