 <h2 class="head2">Leading the Saints to Arrive at the Oneness<br />
of the Full Knowledge of the Son of God</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Son of God. First, He was the Only Begotten of God, without a beginning or an ending. He is the Lord of all, the God in creation. Then He became flesh and put on humanity, passing through death to enter into resurrection. In resurrection, He brought humanity into divinity. The Only Begotten became the Firstborn of God, bearing the dual status, having both divinity and humanity. With respect to His divinity, He is God, and He is the Creator. With respect to His humanity, He is man, and He is a creature. As such, He is a God-man, the all-inclusive Lord. We still need to be led on to advance in the full knowledge of this Lord so that we would not only arrive at the oneness of the faith, but would arrive at the oneness of the knowledge of this mysterious and all-inclusive One.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leading the Saints to Arrive<br />
at a Full-grown Man in the Divine Life</h2>
<p>We should also grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. When we grow, we will arrive at a full-grown man, which means a man that is matured in life. We will then no longer be babes.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leading the Saints to Grow into the Measure<br />
of the Stature of the Fullness of Christ</h2>
<p>Our body is our fullness, and our fullness is our expression. In the same way, the fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23). This Body has a stature with a measure. In order to lead the saints to grow into the measure of this stature of the fullness of Christ, we need to help them to grow in life so that they would hold fast the faith and would lay hold of their knowledge of Christ, giving up all the minor and shallower doctrines and concepts that cause division. In this way, we will grow gradually and will arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>The above few things are what the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers preach and do every day. I hope that you all would learn to speak and to do these same things. You must learn the truth, and know what is the faith, and who is the Son of God, and how to grow in life. When you have learned these lessons and have been taught this way, you will be able to teach others in the same way. As a result, not only are you being perfected, even others are being perfected by you. This is the reason for our change of system. It is to afford everyone equal opportunity to develop his spiritual, organic function. In this way, everyone is learning to speak, to teach, and to grow. I hope these words will get into you and that you will truly receive them. As Christians in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we should be those who are genuine and proper. We should be faithful to the Lord. What we are doing here is absolutely according to the truth of the Bible. By leading and perfecting others, we make everyone an evangelist, a shepherd and teacher, and a prophet who speaks the Lord forth and who speaks the Lord into others. We also make everyone an apostle who knows the revelation, is able to preach the gospel of Christ, can lead the sinners to Him, can raise up a small meeting to express the Lord, and can even define doctrines, release the truth, perfect the saints, and build up the Body of Christ. As a result, the church will be full of apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. This is the church that the Lord is after.</p>
