   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How rarely is absolute truthfulness found!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A strict way is often lonely and without sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When one considers the forlornness of this way, he will realize that there is no great work in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The temptation is to bend and loosen a little.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many have failed in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No price is paid and no labor is expended in succumbing to failure.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How often are we deceiving ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is the result of arguments, reasonings, research, and studies?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Can one stop practicing the truth after these debates?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The conscience may be bribed temporarily, but the truth will still testify to the error of a man's work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do we have the courage to express what we see as right?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do we have the boldness to be "influenced by others" in order to arrive at the proper understanding?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The mind is not the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The root of all problems is the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The crisis in the intellect is built up mainly from an unwilling and dishonest heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the heart is willing, the revelation of Christ will become trustworthy John 7:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the heart is not willing, there is nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, it is important to be true.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Holiness comes before truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many times, truthfulness is there, but holiness is neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man considers some authority to be from God and that believers should submit to it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Under such circumstances, the believers are intimidated from even taking a closer look and a better examination of the truth of the matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The conscience may be active, but it is darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result, one follows man rather than following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, to the Lord holiness is a guarantee of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is good for the Lord to reveal Himself this way to Philadelphia after Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He manifests Himself here.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a church has turned worldly and desolate, what can renew its life and change its attitude?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nothing else will do it except the Lord's revelation of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the nature of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus' person is especially prominent in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the first half of the book, John revealed the Lord Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the second half, he revealed to us the Comforter sent by the departing Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This book has a special place in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The date it was written was quite late; it was written after all the other Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is especially suitable for the day of apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the beginning, it tells us that everything was dark.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even when the true light was shining, man did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This light is the life of man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No matter how desolate the world is, the Lord Himself is still the light and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although there were people in Sardis with clean works, they were not absolutely submissive to the Lord in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, this cannot satisfy the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord must raise up a testimony for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The way to raise it up is to entrust Himself to the love of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not have an absolute heart for Christ, He will not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sin separates us from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But now He is revealing Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All who see Him will serve Him joyfully.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The characteristic of Philadelphia is that although it does not have much power, it is very close to the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The characteristic of the fathers in the first Epistle of John is that they "know Him who is from the beginning" 1 John 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although what Philadelphia has now is but a little power, she has not denied His name.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is revealed in this letter is Christ Himself and not a matter of power.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although the present time is similar to the time John wrote his Epistle, when the church was desolate and antichrists were everywhere, to be drawn close to Christ is the protection from all dangers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Of course, we feel and know that it is hopeless to try to recover the original power and gifts of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, Philadelphia's nature is the drawing near to the Lord and the keeping of His word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Unlike what He did in Sardis, here Christ is not manifesting His power; rather, He is revealing His attributes the Holy One and His word the true One .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>With these two things, we are well able to discern everything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although everything around them has failed, they should still maintain their singleness and purity which they have toward Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the same as what the Epistle of John says: "We might know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true....This is the true God and eternal life" 1 John 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"And you have an anointing from the Holy One" 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the days of the church's failure, the Holy One and the true One is the source of everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"The One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is, of course, related to the revelation of Himself in chapter one as the One who has "the keys of death and of Hades."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, part of the meaning here is the Lord's authority to raise people from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, according to the teaching of 20:4-6, the opening of Hades is for the initiation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because the Lord has the authority of resurrection, He is able to accept or reject people's entry into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the Bible, the first resurrection and the resurrection of the just mean the same thing as the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the third title of the Lord here.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is the most wonderful and outstanding one.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only one other place in the Bible uses the expression "the key of David."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Isaiah 22 the prophet first spoke of "a day of discomfiture" in Jerusalem v. 5, which refers to the coming great tribulation and how destruction would come.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, the people of the city did not fast and pray because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On the contrary, there was "exultation and rejoicing," and the people said: "eating and drinking, for tomorrow we die!" v. 13 . This is obviously a denial of resurrection in unbelief cf.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>1 Cor 15:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because this sin was serious, the Lord was in wrath, and said: "This iniquity shall by no means be covered until you die" Isa 22:14 .</S>
