<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>MAN AS THE CONTAINER</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 9:21, 23; Zech. 12:1; Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MYSTERIES IN THIS UNIVERSE</H2><P>There are many mysteries in this universe. If you do not believe this, I would like to ask you a few questions which I believe none of you can answer. What is the purpose of the universe? What is God? What is man? What are you?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Mystery of the Universe</H2><P>The universe is a mystery. The scientists, physicists, and great philosophers cannot tell us the purpose of the universe. We can see many things in the heavens and on this earth, but what is the universe? It has been a mystery to all the generations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Mystery of God</H2><P>Undoubtedly, God is also a great mystery. God is here. He is in the universe, but no one has ever seen Him, and no one can explain Him. No one can give us a definite, full, thorough, absolute definition of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Mystery of Man</H2><P>Man is also a mystery. No one can define man to the uttermost. What is man? Why is man here? You have to realize that you are a mystery. If you do not believe me, I would ask you how many hearts you have. If you say one, you are wrong. You have more than one heart. Actually, we have two hearts. The Bible says that the heart of man is corrupt to such an extent that it is incurable. The heart of man is deceitful above all things (Jer. 17:9). A medical doctor might examine you and tell you that your heart is healthy. Yet the Bible says your heart is corrupted because the Bible is talking about your psychological heart. Are you clear that you have two hearts? One is your physical heart, and the other is your psychological heart. Physically, our heart may be healthy. But psychologically speaking, our heart is corrupted. One heart is visible, physical; the other heart is invisible, psychological.</P><P>You are so mysterious. You have a mind, but can you tell me where it is? You may say that it is in your soul, but what is the soul and where is the soul? And what is the difference between the mind and the soul? This is a mystery. What is the emotion, and where is the emotion? You have a will, but where is the will? The heart, the mind, the emotion, the will, plus the soul and the spirit of man are all mysteries. This shows that you are so mysterious. I do not know you; neither do you know me. Even you do not know yourself. Not only is God a mystery, but you are too.</P>
