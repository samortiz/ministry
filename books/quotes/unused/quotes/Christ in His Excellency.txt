We have already seen that Christ is surpassing, eternal, unlimited, and complete, but how does this relate to us?
The Lord Jesus was in a city of Samaria called Sychar when He told a Samaritan woman about the living water of life
After that woman believed in the Lord, she left her water pot and went away into the city to testify to all the people
Corinthians 4:7 says, 'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us'
The words excellency and transcendence are very close in meaning to Paul's words in the original language, both meaning super-eminence
Based on these two verses, we know that the Christ in whom we believe and whom we experience is the One who surpasses and transcends all
If we carefully consider these two verses, we will know what kind of heart and understanding we should have in order to comprehend Christ
Genesis 1 shows us that God's purpose in creating man in His image and after His likeness was that man might express Him
Regretfully before this purpose could be fulfilled Satan came and tempted man to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Originally, God met these three needs, but after man lost God, human culture was invented as a replacement of God to meet these three needs
Man realized that he still was not inwardly satisfied with human culture alone, even though he had protection, food, and amusement
It is because these three things can satisfy the needs only in man's body and soul but cannot meet the need in his spirit

If we lack Christ, we are like a human body lacking nutrition, and this allows all kinds of sickness to come in
In Philippians 3:6 Paul said, 'As to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless'
God Himself became flesh, was born in a manger, grew up in a poor family, and came out of a despised, remote region
When the Lord Jesus came to the temple, the Jews considered Him a Samaritan and one who had a demon ; they did not want the Lord Jesus

Or nine times out of ten, this kind of person would bring out The Great Learning because this book is their specialty
If the conscience were not cultivated, it would be dimmed; this is to neglect the bright virtue, to disregard the conscience
When God became a man, that is, when the Lord Jesus came to be our Savior, He brought the reality of these virtues with Him
He died for us, was resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit to enter into us, His believers, to be our life and our content
In this way He lives out of us a kind of living that is true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of
The tabernacle in the Old Testament was a shell, a shadow; the Lord Jesus is the body or the reality of that tabernacle

Christ is in us as a seed that sprouts and grows within us to bear fruit thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold
The term glory has a special meaning in the Bible, a meaning that is hard to explain clearly with human language
Some Chinese people think that when someone has obtained a high position, has become rich, and lives in a luxurious house, he is 'glorified'
The 'glory' mentioned in the Bible, however, refers to God Himself, the expression of God's radiance, the expression of God Himself
Although this situation does not have an outward, visible kind of brilliance, it is full of the Lord's radiance
People saw a little Galilean, Jesus, and wondered how He could do such great and marvelous things; they wondered who He really was
Suddenly, He was transfigured before them, His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light
In other words, His entire being was shining radiantly; this means that the glory which was concealed within Him was now expressed outwardly
Consecrated is Thy temple, Purged from every stain and sin; May Thy flame of glory now be Manifested from within
Even though Christ is concealed within us, this hidden glory cannot always remain covered and sometimes becomes manifest openly
Among the brothers and sisters here today, there is one who believed in the Lord and was saved under such a circumstance
His parents would beat him for believing in the Lord, but he would go meekly into his bedroom to kneel by his bed and pray to the Lord
Many parents oppose when their children first believe in the Lord, but eventually they end up believing in the Lord also
Everyone who is genuinely saved has the glory of the Lord Jesus manifested in him this means that the invisible God is expressed through him
That is because this prayer was prayed by the Lord Jesus directly to God, and it did not matter to Him whether or not we would understand it
The first part of the Lord's prayer in verse 1 says, 'Father, glorify Your Son,' and the second part says, 'That the Son may glorify You'
Verse 2 says, 'Even as You have given Him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom You have given Him'
Verse 3 says, 'And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ'
Today whether or not you have eternal life hinges on whether or not you know the only true God and Him whom He has sent, Jesus Christ

Paul did not have Christ merely as his inward life and nature, but even more he had Christ as the outward expression of his living
Paul did not say that God gave him this grace to announce to the Gentiles Christ's forgiveness of sins as the gospel
The gospel which many people preach today is just one item out of the thousands of items, and that item is the forgiveness of sins
That by itself is not the unsearchable riches; the reality and contents of the gospel make up the riches of Christ
When we are regenerated, we also have an innate capacity to enjoy Christ, and we simply like to enjoy the Lord Himself
The Spirit of reality will declare to us all the riches which He has received of Christ, that is, all that the Lord Jesus is
The Spirit of reality does not merely tell us everything that Christ is, but He also puts everything on display in front of us
All things of the Father are Thine; All Thou art in Spirit is mine; The Spirit makes Thee real to me, That Thou experienced might be
To receive 'of His fullness' and 'grace upon grace' is not only to receive of His fullness but also to receive it with grace upon grace
The riches of Christ are indescribable and immeasurable therefore the supply of the Spirit must be bountiful allinclusive and inexhaustible

Even though there is the aspect of God being the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, They cannot be divided and are still one God
In the four Gospels of the New Testament, the Son came, and the Father and the Spirit also came; the Three were there simultaneously

These six virtues are higher than the benevolence, justice, politeness, wisdom, and trustworthiness taught by the Chinese sages
Out of these are produced holiness, righteousness, goodness, meekness, modesty, forbearance, kindness, and so on
All these riches of God which are also the riches of Christ become our enjoyment in our experience and we thereby express the virtues of God
In other words, God created man according to truthfulness, dignity, righteousness, purity, loveliness, and well speaking
If man had not fallen and not been corrupted by the devil mans condition would be true dignified righteous pure lovely and well spoken of
He is the God who became flesh, the Christ who died and resurrected, and even more the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit
You might be able to submit temporarily, but eventually you will not be submissive because within you there is no submission
It is the same thing for children toward their parents; the obedience with which you obey your parents is Christ
The first time is in John 1:14 where it says, 'And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us full of grace and reality'
It is because John was speaking about God being incarnated and thereby having an expression, which is the expression of His riches
It not only tells us that Jesus the Nazarene is our Lord, but it also tells us that He is God, the incarnated One
The Word was God, and the Word became flesh; this means that God became a man, and this man was our Lord Jesus

Our receiving is not a once-for-all matter; rather, it is a continual receiving, a receiving of grace upon grace
The phrase grace upon grace in Greek implies that grace is like the rolling waves of the sea that come in wave after wave without ceasing
John 12:24 says, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
In practicality when God used dust to create man, He created only a male, Adam; He did not create the female, Eve
In the New Testament, in Ephesians 5, Paul says that the story of Adam and Eve refers to Christ and the church
If we say riches instead of fullness, it is not correct, because all the riches of God have become the fullness of God as His expression
These three fullnesses-the fullness of God, the fullness of Christ, and the fullness of grace and reality-all refer to the same fullness
Ephesians 12223 says and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church which is His Body the fullness of the One who fills all in all
Today the church has Christ as the Head and Christ as the Body, so it is the expression of the fullness of Christ
If we eat steak every day, eventually each one of us will be a tall, strong, full person, and then we all will be the fullness of America
The riches of Christ are very abundant, but unfortunately many Christians are not willing to enjoy Christ as food every day
We should give glory to God, because today God wants to obtain a church that expresses Him to deal with His enemy
From the horizontal aspect of breadth and length to the vertical aspect of height and depth, we are going from a plane to a cube
The work of the ministry is not just the preaching of the gospel, nor is it just the teaching of the Bible or the setting up of a meeting
If any activity is not for the building up of the Body of Christ, it is a work of division, and it is not for the work of the ministry
Although we have the church here today, we must confess that we are still immature, that we have not arrived at a full-grown man
Our goal is the same goal as that of the apostle Paul and all those who have ministered throughout the ages: to build up the Body of Christ
If we preach the gospel, teach the Bible, or set up meetings, but this leads to the division of the Body of Christ, we should not do it
All of our work should be a part of the work of the ministry and should all have the goal of building up the Body of Christ
The trumpet we are sounding here is the same trumpet sounded by the apostle Paul and by the saints throughout the ages
We do this because the excellent Christ has become our all, and we do it for the expression of His fullness-His church
