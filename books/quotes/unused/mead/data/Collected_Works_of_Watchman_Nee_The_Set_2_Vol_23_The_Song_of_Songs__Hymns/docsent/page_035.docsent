   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Maiden's Glory 6:10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 10 says, "Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here the Holy Spirit speaks through the mouth of a third party again and brings out the maiden's glory through exclamatory questions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All four questions refer to the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Holy Spirit likes to stimulate the thoughts of the believers with questions; He arouses their attention once again to consider God's work and understand what is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every time the Holy Spirit poses a question, it comes after a renewed perfecting on the part of the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was the case in chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is repeated again in chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we see the same pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every time the believer reaches a higher level of experience, the Holy Spirit uses questions to reveal the history or reason behind the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Looketh forth as the morning."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She has arrived at the morning again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word "morning" is the same word as "day break" in 2:17 and 4:6.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Her shadows have fled away; there is no further barrier between her and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She enters into a life without barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although it is not yet high noon, it is nevertheless morning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Her future is as bright as the morning light, and her hope is as promising as the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She can look forward to everything, as morning looks forth toward the day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The future and the hope of the morning is high noon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She has already received the promise of high noon Prov 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way of a righteous man in the hand of the Lord goes only as far as high noon; there is nothing after high noon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Fair as the moon."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The emphasis here is not on the waxing or waning of the moon, but on the beauty of it, which is the soft glow that emanates from it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She is heavenly, yet she shines on earth and reveals her testimony to those in darkness Psa 89:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Clear as the sun."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that there is no shadow; she is full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Both the sun and the moon signify her heavenliness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The moon signifies the grace within her, while the sun signifies what she is in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In herself, she is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Like the moon, she has no life and no vitality of her own, and the light and life come from the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When she faces the sun, there is light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When she turns her back to the sun, there is darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, as far as her being in the Lord is concerned, she is clear as the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She is a totally new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is only light; there is no darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as the Lord is the sun, she is also a sun.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Terrible as an army with banners."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only does she have a future that is full of hope, and a life that is absolutely heavenly, but she is a victor who constantly triumphs in her victory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She is "terrible as an army with banners."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She goes from victory to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you know such a one?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Have you seen her?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>C. This Section Being an Unsettled Passage without a Conclusive Judgment 6:11-12</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verses 11 and 12 say, "I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The last clause can be translated, "My soul set me upon the chariots of my willing people."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If these two verses describe the maiden, the only problem is in the expression "my willing people."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Other than this, the two verses seem to be an answer of the maiden; she considers whether there is any progress or advance in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the process of doing this, her heart is set upon the chariots of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the problem, as we have said, lies in the expression "the chariots of my willing people," for only the King can sit in the chariots.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>D. The Maiden's Progress and Victory 6:13</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 13 says, "Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What will ye see in the Shulamite?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As it were the company of two armies."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"Shulamite" means daughter of peace and is the feminine form of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Holy Spirit speaks as a third person and pleads earnestly for her to return so that they can behold her.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>She has gone away on a chariot.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She advances and overcomes, and there is no obstacle or limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now others want to see her and know the kind of preparations she went through in order to arrive at her progress and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the one hand, this request reflects the heart of all those who have similar pursuits, those who are eager to find out the reasons for her present advance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the other hand, the Holy Spirit shows those coming after her the kind of preparation necessary for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He shows it through a request by a third party and an answer by another third party.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Here the Holy Spirit reveals His mind through two groups of third parties.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He sends out the request through one group and provides the answer through another group.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this way, He provides the opportunity for others to know the process which the Shulamite passed through in order to prepare herself for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She is now indeed a Shulamite, because her union with Solomon has become insoluble.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Moreover, she has made Solomon's work her own work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The company of two armies can be translated the dance of two armies.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the place where Jacob saw God's angel Gen 32:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It must be a very exciting place, a place which attracts people.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Dancing is a sign of victory Exo 15:20; 1 Sam 18:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hence, the dance of two armies must mean victory.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This question implies, "Why do you have to look at the Shulamite like looking at two heavenly armies celebrating a victory dance?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What virtues does the Shulamite have that you consider her as two armies?"</S>
