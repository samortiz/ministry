   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING BY AND ACCORDING TO OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MINGLED WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also must learn to walk by and according to our spirit mingled with the Spirit Gal 5:16; Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Praise the Lord that we have a spirit and that our spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What a provision!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our God has created us with a spirit and has even regenerated our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Immediately after regenerating us, He stays with us as the Spirit to be one with us and even to mingle Himself with us as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we have such a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After having a good start in the morning, we should continue to walk, to live, to do everything by this mingled spirit and with this mingled spirit all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must learn to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many married couples cannot avoid having problems with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Very few can avoid these problems because the husband and the wife are so close, and they know each other so well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They feel that they do not need to be careful, so there are always chances for them to get into the self or the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These chances are snares and traps to get you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You must learn to walk and to speak, to talk, by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many times, Satan would send your spouse to tempt you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He or she may say a hard word to you or give you a long face.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But at that time we have to learn how to walk, how to behave, how to have our being and living by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not talk to your spouse by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Talk to your spouse with the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the way that you can always be ready to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>LIVING CHRIST FOR HIS MAGNIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BY THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and this bountiful supply is right within us Phil 1:19-21; Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord has given us a wonderful provision.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, we have His Word in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, we have the Holy Spirit, who is the bountiful Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, living in us, in our spirit, which has been regenerated and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have such a provision, and we can live Christ by this divine provision.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are such persons, we will surely have something to speak when we come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What kind of Christian do you want to be?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you want to be a cold, dumb, dormant, dying, lukewarm, defeated, and backsliding one?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Or do you want to be a Christian who loves the Lord and who is living, refreshing, and active.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why is Christianity not powerful?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is because most of the Christians in the denominations have been stripped of their riches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have been annulled and even choked to death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why they need a religious service in which one person speaks to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But in the Lord s recovery it should be different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord desires to recover a meeting with all the members speaking to function.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But this depends upon our Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must love the Lord, we must be revived, and we must live a victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must abide in the fellowship with the Lord daily and hourly, and we must be praying persons.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must enjoy the Lord in the Word early in the morning to have a new start of each day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must walk and have our being by and according to the mingled spirit, and we must live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are such persons day after day and throughout each day, we will be ready to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Something of Christ will always be bubbling out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit will become a flow out from our innermost being to flow out all the riches of Christ by the Spirit John 7:37-39 .</S>
