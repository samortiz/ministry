How a church goes on depends upon the eldership. We cannot say that there is absolutely no position of elders. Actually, any person has a position. Even a man or a child has a position. The professors have a position in their schools and even a student has his position. We all must see this matter of the position of the elders.<h2 class=head2>No Rank</h2><p>First, the position of the elders should not be considered a position of any high rank. Strictly speaking, according to the New Testament, in the church there should be no rank. This matter of ambition for position and rank was there even with the early disciples, especially among the twelve (Matt. 20:20-24). In Matthew 20 and 23 the Lord Jesus did not allow one inch of ground to be given to rank. He told the disciples that the church was not like the Gentiles. With the Gentiles there are kings and persons of high rank to govern them, but there should be nothing like this among the believers. Then the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;And whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave&#8221; (Matt. 20:27). Among the believers there is only the brotherhood; we are all brothers (Matt. 23:8).<p>When the Brethren were raised up in Britain, many people did their best to ascribe a name to them so that they could be denominated. Because people could not find a name for them, they began to call them the Brethren because they practiced the fact in the Bible that they were all brothers without rank. The name that was used was the King James rendering &#8220;brethren.&#8221; This was not a name that the brothers picked up themselves. Rather, it was a nickname ascribed to them. They realized that there should be no rank among the believers.<p>Also, before the so-called Plymouth Brethren there were brothers in the seventeenth century known as the Grace Brethren and the Moravian Brethren. There were different kinds of brothers in Europe which followed the principle that among the believers there should be no rank. We all have a position, but do not think that we have a rank.<p>Then the episcopal thought invaded the church. Episcopal means having the church government by bishops. The word bishop is included in the word episcopal which in the Greek  is episkopos. It was Ignatius in the second century who mistakenly taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder. However, an overseer (or bishop) in a local church is an elder (Acts 20:17, 28). The two titles refer to the same person; elder denoting a person of maturity; overseer, denoting the function of an elder. An elder is a brother who is more mature and more experienced. This does not denote any rank. To interpret in this way is according to the worldly, natural concept. When the word overseer is used, most people do not have the concept that this is a high rank. However, the word bishop (from Latin episcopus) carries with it the concept of a high rank in the religious mind. Today in Catholicism there is the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. The degraded and organized Christianity has brought in the concept of rank and is using terms such as these. Not only do the Catholic Church and the Episcopal Church have bishops, but also the Methodists have bishops. Ignatius was a dear brother, but he made a big mistake in teaching that an overseer, a bishop, was higher than an elder. This shows us that we must be careful in interpreting the Bible. An overseer or bishop according to Ignatius controls the elders in the churches. This may have seemed like a small mistake, but this was the opening of the door for the hierarchy in today&#8217;s Christendom.<p>We must realize that this thought of rank still remains in our mentality. This thought is not only devilish but, even more, it is hellish. We must got rid of this thought of rank. It should not remain in our mentality. Everybody has a position. The sisters have their position and the brothers have their position, but there should be no rank. The elders are not higher than the brothers and the sisters in the local church. Rather, according to the Lord&#8217;s teaching, the elders are lower because they are the slaves. The sisters who are the wives of the elders should not consider that their husband is higher than others. They should consider that their husbands are slaves and that they are the wives of the slaves. On the other hand, we consider that it is a real honor to be a slave to serve the churches.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> </body></html>
