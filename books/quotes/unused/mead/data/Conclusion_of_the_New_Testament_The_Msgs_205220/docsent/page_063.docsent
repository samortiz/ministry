   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THE CHURCH THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH 14 THE GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bible the golden lampstand is revealed in three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first is in Exodus 25, where the lampstand typifies Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second is in Zechariah 4:2, where the lampstand represents the children of Israel who are in the position of receiving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The third is in Revelation 1, where the golden lampstand is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the foregoing message we considered the lampstand as a type of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message we shall go on to see that the lampstand signifies Israel as God's testimony and also that the golden lampstands signify the seven local churches as God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lampstand Signifying Israel as God's Testimony in the Old Testament and in the Millennium</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The lampstand is first mentioned in Exodus 25.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Near the end of the Old Testament, the lampstand is mentioned again in Zechariah 4:2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"What seest thou?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And I said, I have looked, and behold a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here the lampstand signifies Israel as God's testimony in the Old Testament and in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Old Testament times, whenever the nation of Israel was in a normal condition, it was God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the coming millennium, the restored nation of Israel will once again be God's testimony symbolized by a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Exodus 25 we only have the lampstand with the seven lamps; there is no mention of what the seven lamps refer to.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Zechariah, however, we are given a definite interpretation of the seven lamps, for in this book we are told that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of Jehovah 4:10 and the seven eyes of the stone 3:9 . a. Shining through the Seven Eyes Spirits of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The golden lampstand in Zechariah 4 shines through the seven eyes Spirits of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Zechariah 4:10 says, "For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here "those seven" refers to the seven lamps in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those seven are "the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the seven lamps on the lampstand are the seven eyes of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Zechariah we have the seven eyes and the seven lamps but not the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But in Revelation the seven lamps are developed into the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Out of the throne come forth lightnings and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God" Rev 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we have a new and further development of the seven lamps as the seven Spirits, for we are told clearly that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the seven lamps are the seven eyes and also the seven Spirits, then the seven eyes in Zechariah 4:10 are the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This gives us the ground to say that the lampstand in Zechariah 4 shines through the seven eyes, the seven Spirits, of Jehovah.</S>
