<h1 class="title">EVERYONE FUNCTIONING TO SPEAK<br />
FOR THE LORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OVERTHROWING THE ORDINANCES<br />
OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>By changing the system, we are overthrowing the ordinances of Christianity, in which a few people replace the function of the other members of the Body of Christ. A few members cause the other members to be unemployed and thus kill their function. Traditional Christianity does not believe that all the members can function. In traditional Christianity only the clergy, the pastors and preachers, can function. For this reason, we must rise up to eliminate the system of Christianity in our meetings. This system has the element of leaven that the Lord Jesus spoke of in Matthew 13.</p>
<p>In Matthew 13 a woman hid leaven in three measures of meal (v. 33). The three measures of meal signify Christ as food to supply God&rsquo;s people, and the woman signifies the Roman Catholic Church. History shows that not long after the church was produced, the Catholic Church brought in many different heresies, leaven, and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ. Bakers add leaven to flour to make bread easy to eat. Leavened bread is soft and easy to chew, but unleavened bread is hard and difficult to chew. According to this principle, the Catholic Church brought in many heresies in an attempt to make the truth easy for people to receive.</p>
<p>We came out of Christianity, but our Christian background is still with us, and it influences us. Christianity is influencing people all over the earth. Many people who do not believe in Jesus think that they understand Christianity. Concerning minor items, they think that Christianity involves steepled buildings with bells that ring at specific times on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and crosses on top of the steeples. This is a common concept concerning Christianity. With respect to the major items, unbelievers know that Christianity has pastors and that Christians go to worship services and listen to sermons preached by the pastors. Most people think that Christianity, as represented by the Catholic Church, is mainly composed of &ldquo;pew members,&rdquo; who do not need to do anything but attend mass. There are also priests, bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. When the pope dies, another pope is chosen from among the cardinals to be his successor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED<br />
FROM THE POISON OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>Thirty years ago, when I was in the Philippines, one of the brothers had a relative who was in the hospital. This brother took several other brothers to visit his relative. At the hospital they surrounded the bed of the relative and prayed one by one. The Philippines is a Catholic country, and everyone has some knowledge of Catholicism. According to their understanding, whoever is able to pray must be a pastor. Someone in the ward asked the brothers whether they were pastors, because they prayed better than most pastors. Our brother answered that they were not pastors and that we do not have pastors in our church. This response surprised the people who were present. Christianity gives people the impression that praying and preaching are the job of pastors. This impression, this poison, is still among us. We are only a little better than Christianity.</p>
<p>Even though we changed the system, most of the brothers and sisters still do not pray or function in the meetings. They do not avoid praying, but they do not pray much. Previously our practice was to have everyone listen to a message lasting an hour and a half, after which one person would pray out loud, and then everyone else would pray silently. However, we discovered that this was not a good practice, because most people did not know what to do during the time of silent prayer. Therefore, we changed our practice to allow half an hour after the message for everyone to testify concerning the light, revelation, and help they received. This was an attempt to break the habit of only one person speaking and everyone else listening. This change gave everyone an opportunity to function and was helpful.</p>
<p>The practice of giving testimonies after the message is being carried out successfully in America. Between 1969 and 1974 the testimonies after the messages were living, and sometimes thirty minutes was not enough time. In Taiwan, however, the testimonies are almost all dead, and the same brothers and sisters always stand up to speak. This shows that there are traces of the poison of Christianity among us. In addition, those who speak tend to give long testimonies; they can even speak for fifteen minutes. This is also evidence of the poison of Christianity.</p>
<p>In the physical realm, as soon as a newborn is spanked, it begins to cry. A mother would be concerned if her child did not cry after being spanked. A child who cannot speak by the time he is eight to ten years old is dumb. Today, are the new believers among us and those who have been saved for twenty years speaking Christians, or are we dumb Christians? We speak all day without stopping, but as soon as we step into a meeting, we become dumb. We speak unceasingly outside the meetings, but we become dumb as soon as we are in the meetings.</p>
<p>It is a suffering to be in a family where some family members cannot speak. In the church life the greatest suffering is when no one speaks. What is the meaning of our existence if there is no church on the earth? If we do not speak in the meetings, where else can we speak? Our only enjoyment on the earth is to serve the Lord and the church. Thus, when we encounter someone in the church meetings who does not speak, we suffer.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
