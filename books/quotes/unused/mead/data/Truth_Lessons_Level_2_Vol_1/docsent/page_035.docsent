   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CONSUMMATION OF THE COVENANT A. With Better Sacrifices</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The old covenant was consummated through the sacrifice of bulls and goats as burnt offerings and peace offerings Exo 24:4-5 ; the new covenant was consummated through the offering of Jesus Christ Himself as the sacrifice Heb 9:14, 23; 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As Christ is the eternal Son of the living God incarnated to be the Son of Man, who offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, so His sacrifices are better than all the sacrifices of the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Bulls and goats as sacrifices were shadows which could never take away sins Heb 10:11 , but He as the sacrifices is the reality of the shadows, and He has put away sin once for all, thus finding an eternal redemption Heb 9:26, 12 , fully satisfying God s desire, and enabling the believers in Him to have peace and fellowship with God that both God and man may be satisfied Rom 5:1; Col 1:20-22; 2 Cor 5:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The new covenant was consummated in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. With the Blood of Jesus, the Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the new covenant was consummated through Jesus Christ as the better sacrifices, it was, of course, enacted with the blood of Jesus, the Son of God 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not like the old covenant, which was consummated with the blood of bulls and goats which cannot take away sins Heb 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of sins Matt 26:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It has accomplished eternal redemption for us Heb 9:12; Eph 1:7; 1 Pet 1:18-19 and has purchased the church of God Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It washes us from our sins Rev 1:5; 1 John 1:7 , purifies our conscience Heb 9:14 , and sanctifies us Heb 13:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By this blood we enter the Holy of Holies Heb 10:19 and overcome Satan, the accuser Rev 12:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, it is precious and better than the blood of goats and bulls Heb 9:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The new covenant was consummated with this precious blood Luke 22:20 .</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE RESULT A. The Believers Being Forgiven of Their Sins</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thousands and thousands of sinners have received forgiveness of sins by believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are no longer sinners or offenders.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have been delivered from the eternal penalty of sin, and they have been freed from the bondage and power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. The Believers Receiving the Law of Life</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The believers not only have been forgiven of their sins by believing in Christ, but they have also received the eternal life with its law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this law of life God can be God to them and they can be a people to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, the natural function of the law of life enables them to know God subjectively from within and to enjoy all the riches of what the Triune God is to them.</S>
