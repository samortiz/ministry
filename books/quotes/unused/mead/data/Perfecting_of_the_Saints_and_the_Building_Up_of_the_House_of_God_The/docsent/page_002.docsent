   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE GOD S NEED IN THE PRESENT AGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first six messages our fellowship will mainly be to gain spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The purpose of this fellowship is not to discuss certain matters or to set up a training but rather to provide an opportunity for us to come together and fellowship concerning the work and the service.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am also burdened to fellowship concerning the building up of the church, our spiritual pursuit, and the supply through the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to my disposition, I am inclined to labor for a long time in only one place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In relation to our disposition, regardless of how much we experience salvation, God does not intend to annul our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the reason that Paul s Epistles have Paul s flavor and that John s Epistles have John s flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The writing of the apostles was out of the Holy Spirit, but it has their flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though we usually associate disposition with naturalness, the Lord does not intend to annul the disposition of the people who are in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord desires that man be mingled with Him and yet maintain the distinctiveness of man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After I graduated from school, I worked in one company.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many of my schoolmates and friends encouraged me to look for a better job, but I did not want to change where I worked.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I worked in the same company for six to seven years before I began to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I worked in only one place until I served the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, wherever I served, I labored diligently; I did not move from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was in northern China for a long time, but I labored only in one place the church in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more I labored, the more work I saw that needed to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then one day the Lord raised up circumstances that sent me to southern China.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I then labored for a long time in the Shanghai and Nanking areas.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Again, if not for the circumstances, it is possible that I would still be in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more I labored, the more I felt the need to labor, because there was much to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But God raised up circumstances that did not allow me to continue to labor there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Under the Lord s arrangement, I had to travel back and forth between two or three different places.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though I traveled from one place to another, the Lord rarely led me personally.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most of the time the Lord raised up circumstances that forced me to move, or the senior co-workers charged me to move.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, I always felt dissatisfied because I expected to stay in one place for a long time and concentrate my energy and strength to labor and build up a local church as a strong model.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE POVERTY AND WEAKNESS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>BEING THE RESULT OF A SHORTAGE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IN THE SUPPLY AND THE LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>OF THE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord s arrangement in various circumstances over the years compelled me to travel often.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I once fellowshipped with the responsible brothers that I hoped to remain in Taipei, and not travel for a long period, in order to build up a model, because the condition of our district meetings is not what it should be.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is mainly because of a shortage in the supply and the leading in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It seems as if the church is a shell, and there is a shortage in content.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even though there are more than twenty district meetings, the content of these meetings needs to be enriched and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In a certain sense, they are more impoverished than before.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, there is the need for a supply from the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the past the elders in the church in Taipei were willing to receive my help.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, after they received the help, the result they worked out was different than what I envisioned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To illustrate, the brothers and sisters in Southeast Asia have a good recipe for breakfast pastries.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when we follow this recipe, the breakfast pastries that we make are raw and unattractive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows that it is one thing to have instructions, and it is another thing to have the skill to follow the instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, after hearing messages concerning the enjoyment of God, the brothers tried to lead the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet somehow their practice turned out to be different from what it was supposed to be.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is similar to the Chinese saying, He painted a tiger, but it turned out as a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church in Taipei is a large church with about two thousand saints in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The greatest shortage is that the elders administration of the church is poor and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The saints lack color and energy, but this is not because the brothers have made mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It seems as if the saints have not eaten for days, or they do not receive adequate nutrition from their food.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Undoubtedly, the saints are weak because they lack a supply from the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The elders, the responsible ones in the district meetings, and the full-time serving ones have tried their best, but there is still a lack.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the reason that I want to stay in Taipei for an extended period.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I would rather sacrifice the work in other places in order to remain here and work together with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not want to merely give them instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I want to work together with them and guide them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A church as large as the church in Taipei has many needs, but the brothers and sisters who serve in Taipei do not have the skills to meet these needs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It seems as if we are building a house without the proper skills.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have labored in Taipei for many years, but the result of our work is poor and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even though we may not be blamed for the shortage of our work, we cannot deny that it is poor and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have considered this problem before the Lord from many angles.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the one hand, because I could not be here continually, there has been a lack but not a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the other hand, my frequent travels overseas have deepened and broadened my spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If I had not traveled all these years, my spiritual insight would not be as sharp as it is now.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A person who stays in one place for a long time can see only a partial picture.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If I had stayed in one place, my understanding would not be as deep as it is now.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On the one hand, my absence was a lack, but on the other hand, my traveling has enabled me to have a broader view and a deeper and higher realization.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I feel that this gain is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, I want to fellowship my observations with you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You may not feel the same as I do, because we are looking at things from different angles.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nevertheless, I want to fellowship my impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I am about to visit nearly every major city on every continent except Australia.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A number of these cities do not have a church that we know of; nevertheless, I would like to visit these cities.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Most of the cities have local churches.</S>
