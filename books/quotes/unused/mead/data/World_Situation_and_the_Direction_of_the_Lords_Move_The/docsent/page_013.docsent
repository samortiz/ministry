   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord s Present Charge to Us Should Be:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Go and Teach the Nations That</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Present Age May Be Consummated</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord s present charge to us should be: go and teach the nations cf.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matt 28:19 that the present age may be consummated 24:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to take the Lord s charge, we must keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must have the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we lose the oneness and the one accord, we are finished as far as the Lord s move is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I realized the danger of divisions among us over the past ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why I called at least four urgent elders meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I told the brothers that I realized there was the tendency among us toward divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was because some of the brothers wanted to have their own work within the unique work of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, by 1987 my warning was fulfilled, and these divisions came to the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The main cause of these divisions was ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some desired to have their own work, and at the same time they pretended to be for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the saints go to Europe, they should not touch any of these negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should only go to teach the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should teach people about God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should tell them how the eternal God is triune and how He is perfect and complete as love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we can go on to teach them God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In God s economy, He desires to have man as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, He created the heavens for the earth, the earth for man, and man with a spirit to receive Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to teach people God s economy, God s desire, God s plan, God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We also need to teach people God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to tell them how God wants to dispense Himself in His element and essence into our being to make Himself one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should also teach people about the wonderful process through which the Triune God has passed in order to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was incarnated and lived a human life on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In His living we can see the divine attributes and the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death to deal with Satan, the world, sin, the flesh, the old man, the old creation, and the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through His death, on the positive side, He released the divine life and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His resurrection, we were resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He became the firstborn Son, and we, through regeneration by Him and with Him, became God s many sons as the members of Christ to constitute His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to teach people all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should also teach people the detailed items of Christ s redemption through His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He redeemed us by washing us, forgiving us, justifying us, and reconciling us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We also should minister to people the items of God s salvation in the life of Christ, in regenerating us, renewing us, sanctifying us, transforming us, conforming us into His image, and glorifying us in Christ as the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The people also need to see all the aspects of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They need to eventually see how the one universal church, as the Body of Christ, should be expressed as the local churches in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to teach with much stress the truths concerning the all-inclusive Christ and the church as the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, the church will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the ultimate manifestation of the processed Triune God mingled with the transformed tripartite man to express the Triune God to the fullest in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our teaching of the divine truths should include the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we go to Europe, we should teach the central line of the divine truth with the main stresses without making any small point an issue for debating or fighting that causes divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition to teaching the divine truths, we have to have a complete change from the old, traditional, unscriptural way of meeting and serving to the new, scriptural way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>History tells us that whoever changes from the old to the new always gains.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The method of transportation has eventually changed from the mule wagon to the airplane.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It goes without saying that this change has made travel much easier and more efficient.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Chinese people who left the mainland to live overseas have learned to leave their oldness and pick up the new things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what makes them so successful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We also have to have a complete change to the Lord s new way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Time sifts people, so we must have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There have been a number of major changes in the present world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first change is the formation of the European Common Market.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although England, France, and Germany have disagreed with one another for centuries, they have become members of this Common Market.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Second, the satellite countries of Russia have changed their philosophy from atheism and communism to democracy and the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Russia has also changed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Another major change involved the crisis between Iraq and Kuwait and the war that followed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is amazing that the President of the United States made such a strong decision to deal with Iraq.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This dealing turned out for the benefit of Israel and for the putting down of its opposing Arab countries.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>While the world situation has been changing, we have also been changing from the old way to the new way, the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot change the truth, but we surely have to change our way to carry out the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all need to change our philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to change the way we preach, the way we meet, the way we help people, and the way we have our home meetings and group meetings to match the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Much of what we are now doing is still according to the old philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to change our philosophy and give up any confidence in our old way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The leading ones should not have the confidence that they know how to manage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to consider how much fruit has been borne by us in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Fruit is the expression and manifestation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We may have been in a locality for years with very little fruit, very little increase.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Would we take that way to carry on a business?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Fruit is a strong proof of where we really are.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need to have a change, not trusting in our old way.</S>
