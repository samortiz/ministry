   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"ELIJAH WITH MOSES"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the Lord was transfigured, suddenly Elijah and Moses appeared before the disciples and conversed with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Peter must have thought, "This is such a rare opportunity for the three of us to be with the three of you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He proposed to the Lord, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet the Lord did not answer him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose someone invites you to tea and you only stare at him without saying a word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Saying nothing is more severe than saying "no" to him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not saying anything means rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Silence means resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ should never be ranked equally with Moses and Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The kingdom of God has replaced the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the kingdom of God is here, Moses and Elijah must go away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only then can Jesus Christ of Nazareth come.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If Moses and Elijah are still here, Jesus cannot come.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moses and Elijah cannot be mixed together with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the Old Testament continues, the New Testament cannot come.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The disciples did not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Mark never followed the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was a young man, and he was a disciple of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Gospel of Mark is Mark's written account of what he heard from Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter spoke the words, but Mark recorded the message.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is an historical fact concerning the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Gospel of Mark is actually the Gospel of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why the Gospel of Mark gives us more specific details concerning Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Peter loved to talk.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wherever he was, he always had something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At this point he said something foolish again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But after he said it, he did not know how to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord was silent, and Peter did not know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But God spoke at this juncture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Father's words seemed to be directed at Peter specifically; they were words of rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Father seemed to be saying, "You should use your ears and not your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You should listen to the Lord instead of asking the Lord to listen to you."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here we see what the New Testament is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not listen to the law and the prophets any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, we should listen to the beloved Son of God, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The prophets should be put aside, and the law should be put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The New Testament is Jesus Christ revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A life according to the New Testament is just a life of obedience to the revelation of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moses represents the law, which tells us that God has established regulations for man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition to the Ten Commandments, the Pentateuch contains hundreds of additional commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These are also laws.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Old Testa- ment only contains God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When men in the Old Testament wanted to know whether a certain matter was right, all they had to do was find the answer in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They did not necessarily have an inner sense of right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Their "yes" and "no" were written in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a person observed the various ordinances and laws, he would be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Old Testament all problems were dealt with by the law; the law determined what was right and what was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, the law separates man from God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It sets up a standard of right and wrong apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But these are dead standards.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thank the Lord, the Old Testament is over.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The law is over.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today in the New Testament dispensation, only God is our "yes" and "no."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God in us becomes our law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a man does not have God and only has regulations, and if all he knows is "yes" and "no," he is still in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once a person has God, he will be delivered from right and wrong, and he will truly be one who lives in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have a servant in my house called Mr. Wong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His disposition is entirely opposite of mine.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He likes to have rules and regulations for everything he is about to do, and he likes to work by these rules and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, all I want is for him to obey me and to do things according to my desire.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What he wants is in the principle of the Old Testament; what I like is in the principle of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>With the law there is no need for man to draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He can know what is right and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The law is a set of dead moral standards apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is something that once it is known, will be known forever.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But the New Testament requires a daily knowing and a moment by moment knowing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the New Testament Moses cannot exist; the law cannot exist.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>True knowledge of the Lord is not the knowledge of yesterday; nor is it derived from books.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is knowledge that comes from the Lord who is living and speaking in us; it is always in the present tense.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What do the prophets represent?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The prophets supplemented what was lacking in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They were the ones who inquired of God on behalf of men.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A prophet was one who sought God's will on behalf of others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For instance, you might be sick and not know whether you would become well or not.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You could send for a prophet to inquire of God to see whether or not you would become well.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Or you might not know whether or not you should go to a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You could ask someone to inquire of God's will for you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This was the work of a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The law enabled you to know right and wrong according to dead regulations, while a prophet told you what was right and wrong in place of you knowing it yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God said that we should not listen to Moses or Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, there are many Elijahs today.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Suppose we have a very spiritual brother or sister among us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you have a problem, it is easy to ask him or her to inquire of God for you.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you are not clear about God's will, it is easy to charge him or her to inquire about God's will for you.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is the principle of a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is what Elijah did.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The law takes away man's direct communication with God, and the prophet also takes away man's direct fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Both the law and the prophets stand between man and God and separate man from God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Some may ask why there are prophets in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>What is the difference between New Testament prophets and Old Testament prophets?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>New Testament prophets are completely different from Old Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Lord gave some prophets in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Their principal work is the building up, encouragement, and consolation of men 1 Cor 14:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They only explain the prin- ciples of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They do not go into the details of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>"THIS IS MY SON, THE BELOVED.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>HEAR HIM"</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Isaiah prophesied that one day, "the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah,/As the waters cover the sea" 11:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>God's words are marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He says the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>"Full" means there is no longer any need.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Hebrews 8:11 says, "And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them."</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This means that neither a fellow citizen nor a brother can be one's prophet any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We have to know God ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The New Testament is the Lord living in us, telling us what is from God, what is right, and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The New Testament is the Lord leading us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Because of this we have no need for others to instruct us anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We can receive spiritual help from others, but the detailed leading of God's will is strictly a matter between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Today the prophets and the law are over.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We need to hear, "This is My Son, the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Hear Him!"</S>
