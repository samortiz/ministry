   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO CONFESSION AND RECOMPENSE Scripture Reading: Lev 6:1-7; Matt 5:23-26 I. A CONSCIENCE VOID OF OFFENSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we have believed in the Lord, we must build up a habit of confessing and recompensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have offended anyone or have come short of anyone, we should learn to confess or to recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, we have to confess to God, and on the other hand, we have to confess to and recompense man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a man does not confess to God nor apologize or recompense man, his conscience will easily become hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once the conscience becomes hardened, a serious and fundamental problem develops: It becomes difficult for God s light to shine into a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A person must build up a habit of confessing and making recompense so that he can maintain a sensitive and keen conscience before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There was once a worker of the Lord who used to ask others, When was the last time you confessed to someone?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If it has been a long time since a person s last confession to another person, there has to be some problem with this person s conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We often offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a person has offended someone yet has no feeling about it, his conscience must be sick or abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The length of time since your last confession is an indication of whether or not there is a problem between you and God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the period of time is long, it proves that there is a lack of light in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the time is short, that is, if you recently have made a confession to others, it proves that the feeling of your conscience is still sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to live under God s light, we need a sensitive conscience, and in order for our conscience to remain sensitive, we need to continually condemn sin as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to confess to God, and we also need to make confessions and recompenses to man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have offended God and the offense has nothing to do with man, we do not need to confess to man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not overdo anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a brother or sister s sins are unrelated to man, having only offended God, he or she only needs to confess to God; there is absolutely no need to confess to man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope that we will pay attention to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What kind of sins offend man?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How should a person apologize to another person or recompense another person when he offends him or comes short in his dealings with him?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to be clear about this, we need to carefully study two portions of Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE TRESPASS OFFERING IN LEVITICUS 6</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are two sides to the trespass offering: One is revealed in Leviticus 5 and the other in Leviticus 6.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Chapter five tells us that we should confess to God and offer up sacrifices for forgiveness of our miscellaneous sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chapter six tells us that it is not enough to offer up a sacrifice to God if we have offended a person materially; we should also restore something to the offended party.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapter six says that if we have offended anyone in material things, we should take care of the matter with men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, we also need to confess to God and ask for His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But just dealing with God is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot ask God to forgive us on behalf of the ones whom we have offended.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How should we take care of the matter from man s side?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us look at the trespass offering in Leviticus 6.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A. Some Sins That Are Trespasses against Man</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Leviticus 6:2-7: When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against Jehovah, All sins are ultimately trespasses against Jehovah and lies to his fellowman in regard to a deposit or a security, or through robbery, or if he has extorted from his fellowman, or has found what was lost and lied about it, and has sworn falsely concerning any of the things a man may do to sin thereby then it shall be, when he sins and is guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery, or what he got by extortion, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing which he found, or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more; he shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then he shall bring to the priest his trespass offering to Jehovah, a ram without blemish from the flock, according to the valuation, for a trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And the priest shall make propitiation for him before Jehovah, and he shall be forgiven for whatever he may have done by which he has become guilty.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A person who has offended anyone or transgressed against anyone in material things has to settle it with men before he can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If he does not settle it with men, he will not be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are six kinds of transgressions against man in these verses:</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1 Lying to one s fellowman in regard to a deposit: This means to be entrusted with something and then to purposely withhold the good and costly portions while surrendering the inferior portions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is lying, and it is a sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not lie to others in regard to their deposit but rather guard it faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God s children should always guard faithfully the things that others have entrusted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we cannot guard it, we should not accept such a deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once we accept it, we should do our best to guard it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If anything happens to it through our unfaithfulness, we have trespassed against man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>2 Lying to one s fellowman in regard to a security: This means to deal falsely or to lie in business transactions or to profit through improper means or to usurp something that is not yours in trade.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is to sin before the Lord, and it should be dealt with in a strict way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>3 Robbing a fellowman: Although this may not happen among the saints, we still have to say something about it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one may acquire anything by way of robbery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Anyone who tries to usurp the possessions of others by means of his status or power has committed a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>4 Extorting from one s fellowman: It is a sin to take advantage of anyone through the influence of one s own position and power.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In God s eyes His children should never do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This kind of conduct must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>5 Finding what is lost and lying about it: New believers must pay special attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many people have lied about the things which others have lost.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To turn something into nothing, to reduce much to little, or to exchange what is bad for what is good is the same as lying.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Something is there, yet you say that nothing is there.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There may be much, but you say that there is little.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Something may be good, but you say that it is bad all this is lying.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Others have lost something, and you take advantage of them, extorting some gain and benefit out of them; this is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A Christian must not take possession of others belongings and make them his own.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you have picked up something by accident, you have to guard it well and return it to the owner.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Never claim lost items as your own.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is wrong to keep lost articles; it is more wrong to usurp the possessions of others by illegal means.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To turn other s possessions into one s own by any unrighteous means is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A believer should not do anything that profits himself at the expense of others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>6 Swearing falsely: It is a sin to swear falsely concerning any material thing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You know something, yet you say that you do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You have seen something, yet you say that you have not seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Something is there, yet you say that nothing is there.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Anyone who swears falsely has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Concerning any of the things a man may do to sin thereby this refers to transgressions against men in terms of material things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God s children should learn and always remember this lesson they should not make the possessions of others their own.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The possessions of others belong to them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do not make their possessions yours.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Whoever swears falsely in any of the things mentioned above and transgresses against others has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Brothers and sisters, if there is any dishonesty in anything you do, if you have acquired anything at the expense of others, or if you have acquired anything by means of these six ways, you have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You have to deal with these sins thoroughly.</S>
