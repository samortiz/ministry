   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 61 Date:September 17, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER D. S.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was young I was very active.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Someone once asked me if I had believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I told him yes and that I had peace in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1935 I attended Brother Nee's Overcomer Conference in Chuanchow, Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I felt the love of the Lord among the brothers and sisters and felt that it was heaven on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After I heard the messages on overcoming, my knowledge of the truth increased, and I felt closer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once I went with a brother to preach the gospel in Ku-Tien, Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the end of the gospel meeting, I saw a squalid manual laborer confessing his fear of hell and his faith in the Lord with trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He consecrated himself at that very moment to the Lord and vowed to preach the gospel for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Prior to that I was very timid, and I would blush as soon as I opened my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The squalid man's consecration touched me deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I became bold to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Fear left me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Later because of my strong craving to attend school in Shanghai, I turned away from the Lord and became cold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord did not let me go.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One day while I was waiting for a bus, a voice within rebuked me, saying, "Why are you so stiff-necked?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why are you fighting with God?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I began to read the Bible and pray again, and I vowed to follow His will once more.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I read 2 Kings 15:20, the words turned back touched me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My heart was softened, and I asked for the Lord's forgiveness in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once I heard the testimony of a preacher who threw his three Ph.D. diplomas into the sea in his determination to be a preacher for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The story touched me, and I dropped my thought of furthering my education.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I returned to my village and worked as a common teacher, using that opportunity to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Soon afterwards I quit my teaching job and worked in a transportation business.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My spiritual condition deteriorated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was not able to stand up again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord allowed me to suffer twice from typhoid fever.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In my sickness I prayed to the Lord and received His deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the past few years my involvement in business has unavoidably led me into cheating, deceit, and greed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have asked for the Lord's forgiveness, and I have trusted in His blood for a purged conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During this time I asked the Lord for a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Brother Witness Lee came, I was revived.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have a question now: Where does the line between God's work and man's responsibility lie?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have had the experience of Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After listening to the truth on this subject twice, a brother told me that I had still not broken through on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I thought he meant that I did not understand the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later I found that I had to break through in experience before I could know the overcoming truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brother Nee's word on the mountain concerning Aaron's rod has enlightened me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I see that God is the One who does all the work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our brother has all kinds of problems in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Your mind is strong, but your disposition is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is your real problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In spiritual matters, do not try to solve the problems in the mind first.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>An unbeliever has many problems in the mind, but we do not try to solve these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, we tell him to believe in the Lord first, and then the problems of his mind will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you learn to trust in God, the problems in your mind will go away easily.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The many problems in your mind have become a spiritual problem to you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Originally, they were not a spiritual problem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The worst thing with you is the combination of a weak disposition with a strong mind.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your will is weak, and your disposition is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You cannot expect to change these traits by doing something.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet you can ask for the Lord's mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He can make you the same as Peter, who was reconstituted with a durable and strong character.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After the Lord's resurrection, Peter became strong, except for the one incident in Galatians 2 when he flinched.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the coming days you need to be strengthened in your character.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have to be stable, and you have to ask the Lord to make you simple.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You have to learn to look to Him, rest in Him, and trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once your character is strengthened, the problems in your mind will go away.</S>
