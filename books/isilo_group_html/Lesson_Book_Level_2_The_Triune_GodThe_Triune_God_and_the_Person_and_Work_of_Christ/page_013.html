OUR BEING IN THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>In Matthew 28:19, the Lord commanded His disciples to baptize new believers into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. So when we were baptized through believing in the Lord, not only did the Triune God come into us, but we were also put into the Triune God. The Lord prayed in John 17:21, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us." First John 2:24 says, "You will abide both in the Son and in the Father." These verses clearly show us that not only the Father and the Son are coinhering; even we the believers are coinhering with the Triune God.</P><P>Specifically, the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 1:30 that we are in Christ: "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus." Also, Romans 6:3 tells us that when we are baptized we are put into Christ Jesus. First Corinthians 12:13 says, "In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body..and were all given to drink one Spirit." First Corinthians 12:3 says, "No one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit." You see, the Bible reveals to us that we are in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We are in the Triune God. By calling on His name "Lord Jesus Christ," we receive the Triune God and we are put into the Triune God. Hallelujah! This is so wonderful. God can be in us, and we can be in God. We are coinhering with the Triune God. We are no more pitiful sinners destined to hell. Neither are we Christians going to heaven. No! We are free of God's condemnation of eternal death, but much more, we are now one with the Triune God. He lives in us and we live in Him. Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! Amen!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. LIVING IN THIS COINHERENCE</H2><P>So when you are tempted by your friends to go to some improper places like movie theaters, or to do some evil things, be reminded that you are not alone. Do you think that God would like to go to those places or do those things? If you go, you will bring Him there. Wherever you go and whatever you do, you are always coinhering with the Triune God. He will never leave you, nor can you ever leave Him. At such times, call on the Lord to activate the Triune God within you. Then walk away from such temptations. When you are with your friends, you can speak God into them by telling them about this wonderful Triune God, His full salvation, and your coinherence with Him. Then Satan cannot touch you, the world cannot influence you, the whole creation will be under you, and your friends will thank you. And God will be happy in you. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! What a wonderful relationship we have with our God!
