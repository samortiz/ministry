   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CASTING OUT THE DEMONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Matthew 12:28 the Lord said that He cast out demons by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to realize that demons and demon possession are real.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>About one hundred years ago, a Presbyterian missionary from the United States by the name of Dr. Nevius went to China.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He wrote a book entitled Demon Possession and Allied Themes, in which he told story after story of cases involving demon possession.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today in the United States, it is difficult to see a real case of demon possession.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What the Pentecostals say concerning demon possession is not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their so-called cases of demon possession are actually cases of mental illness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1948 I was in Nanking, China.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There was a boy there who suddenly became crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of the saints considered that he was demon-possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They came together to pray to cast out the "demon," but the more they prayed, the more he was active.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then they wondered about this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It seemed to them that the Lord's name was not that powerful or mighty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They prayed in the name of the Lord Jesus for the "demon" to depart, but it did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then they referred the case to me and told me what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I told them that this was not a case of demon possession, but a case of mental illness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I told these saints that this boy should be sent to the hospital for a period of time to be under some medical care.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, the boy was admitted to the hospital, and he became well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today, cases of demon possession occur mostly in backward countries which are very primitive and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people in these backward countries do not have much education or knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are very poor and under all kinds of depression.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The demons can have the opportunity to possess such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In modern countries many people are educated, so the opportunity for the demons to possess people is rare.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Modern countries, however, are full of people with mental illness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Too much knowledge and education can be a factor of mental illness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the primitive countries, there are more cases of physical demon possession, but in the educated countries, there are more people with psychological problems.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At any rate, the Spirit is the means by which the demons can be cast out.</S>
