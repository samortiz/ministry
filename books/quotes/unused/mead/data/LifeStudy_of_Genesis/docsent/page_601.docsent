   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. With the Precious Things</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Put Forth by the Moon</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Deuteronomy 33:14 also speaks of "the precious things put forth by the moon."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Holy Spirit never uses the wrong word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Notice that this verse says that the sun has brought forth, but that the moon has put forth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sun produces, but the moon does not produce.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, fruit is brought forth by the sun, but the precious things are put forth by the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In reality, Christ is the sun, and the church is the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fruits are brought forth by Christ, but they are put forth by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One of these fruits is forgiveness, and another is justification.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Other fruits put forth by the church are reconciliation, redemption, and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We receive forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, redemption, and eternal life not directly from Christ, but indirectly through the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Thessalonians 2:14 says, "For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse indicates that the Gentile churches followed the churches in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The churches in Judea had been established longer, and they had learned and experienced a number of things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever they learned and experienced was put forth to the Gentile churches, and the Gentile churches enjoyed their fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nearly all the riches of Christ we enjoy day by day do not come directly from Christ, but come indirectly through the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever the church in Anaheim enjoys and experiences will be put forth to all the other churches, and what the other churches experience will be put forth to the church in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Recently the churches in Taiwan helped us to eat and digest the life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a fruit put forth by the churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The blessings upon us include all the experiences of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>F. and G. With the Best Things</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>of the Ancient Mountains</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>and with the Precious Things</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>of the Eternal Hills</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Genesis 49:26 speaks of the blessing unto the "utmost bound of the eternal hills," and Deuteronomy 33:15 says, "And with the best things of the ancient mountains, and with the precious things of the eternal hills" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The words "ancient" and "eternal" indicate that this blessing refers to time, but the words "mountains," "hills," and "utmost bound" indicate that the blessing also refers to space.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Together time and space equal the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, this verse indicates that the blessing we are under is universal, from eternity past to eternity future and from the ancient mountains to the eternal hills, even to the utmost bound.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This, of course, is poetic language.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It indicates that the blessings we are under are universal, covering all of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The mention of the mountains and hills implies that the plain is included, for it is impossible to be on the mountain without passing through the plain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, the mountains, the hills, and the utmost bound imply all of space, including even the meeting hall and your place of dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The universal blessing is long and wide, and it reaches from eternity past to eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is so spacious that we cannot travel through it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The blessing we are under is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every time, morning, afternoon, and evening, day and night, is a time of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you get into the new heaven and the new earth, you will see that at every time and in every place there will be a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time there will be no more sea, meaning that there will be no curse.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The entire universe will be a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In space there will be blessing, and in time there will be blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The new heaven and the new earth will be nothing but a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time you will understand that our blessing is from eternity past to eternity future and from the ancient mountains to the eternal hills, even to the utmost bound.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At every time and in every place we are under this blessing.</S>
