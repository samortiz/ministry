<h2 class="head2">Only the Holy Spirit Has the Authority</h2><p>When the whole church fellowships together, the brothers and sisters can express their opinion as much as they want. But please remember that expressing your opinion does not mean that things will be done according to your way. When the brothers and sisters speak, the elders must listen. The elders have to learn to listen to the brothers and sisters. They have to see if there is the voice of the Holy Spirit in their speaking. The Gospel of Luke says that when Elizabeth heard the voice of Mary the mother of Jesus, the baby leaped in her womb (1:41). No matter who opens his mouth to speak, the elders must learn to listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit through such a one&rsquo;s speaking. When the brothers and sisters speak, often their words are right but their spirit is wrong. The elders must learn to listen and discern.</p><p>A debate can be loud and noisy, but debates in the church end in silence. The ones who make the final decision are the responsible brothers. They have to touch the authority of the Holy Spirit in the church with their spirit and make the final decision accordingly. Church business is not conducted on the basis of the opinion of the elders, but on the basis of what the saints speak and on the spirit of the prophets. The decision of James in Acts 15 was not based on his personal opinion. He first listened to the brothers&rsquo; speaking, Peter&rsquo;s speaking, and Paul and Barnabas&rsquo;s speaking; then he made the final decision based on the word of Amos the prophet (vv. 14-18). The way to conduct business in the church is not by dictatorship. Neither is it by representation or democracy. Decisions in the church are not arrived at through voting or the consensus of a few. Rather the responsible brothers make the decisions. But the responsible brothers must see to it that in spiritual matters, there is the order of spiritual leadership. In the church there is no democracy and there is no dictatorship. We can say the same thing about the deacons. Those who have learned more spiritual lessons spontaneously are in front. Those who have learned less fall behind. Some brothers have learned more, and they stand in the leading position, but this does not mean that they have authority in themselves. They must learn to draw their authority from the Holy Spirit. They do not fight for authority like men scrambling to get on a bus. Authority comes spontaneously. John was always behind Peter. James was at one time behind Peter, but later was ahead of Peter. In the Gospels, James was not yet a believer, but later he rose spiritually. He gained a high stature among the Jewish believers in Jerusalem, inasmuch as Paul attained a high stature among the Gentile believers.</p><p>When the church calls a meeting for fellowship and decision, it does not act on the vote of the majority. Actually, the feeling of the majority often is wrong. Among the seventeen deacons, one must be the leader. Among the five elders, one must be responsible to touch the authority of the Holy Spirit to make the final judgment. If an ordinary brother or sister says something different and the responsible ones feel that this is the will of God, the church must make the decision based on the opinion of that brother or sister. In Acts 15 there were no so-called negotiations. There was no human opinion. No ground was left for the unspiritual. Therefore, the brothers and sisters must learn to live humbly before the Lord. The elders must be clear in their spirit. In this matter the leading brothers bear a heavy responsibility. If you are proud and self-assuming and do not learn your spiritual lessons properly, God&rsquo;s business will be destroyed by your hand. In this matter the responsible ones must learn. On the one hand, they have to receive much dealing and learn many lessons before the Lord. On the other hand, they have to follow the pattern of Acts 15. They have to learn to listen to the brothers and sisters, to touch the authority of the Holy Spirit, and to make decisions before God.</p>
