   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DISPENSING OF GOD AS GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The stewardship, moreover, involves a dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Dispensation here refers not to an age, but to a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, a mother dispenses food to her children every morning at breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the children sit down at the table, the mother dispenses nourishing food for them to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In such a dispensation a proper control is always exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a child misbehaves, the mother may say, If you don t behave, there will be no breakfast for you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the dispensation of food is the best control.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have observed this with my own grandchildren, who obey their grandmother better than they obey me, because she is the one who dispenses treats to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because she does the dispensing, she can very easily and pleasantly control them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She controls them by means of a sweet dispensation, a dispensation that is also a kind of administration and intimate service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The heading up of all things in Christ does not take place by a governmental administration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the contrary, it comes about by a sweet stewardship, by an intimate household arrangement, by a pleasant dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It takes place through the dispensing of the abundant life supply of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Apostle Paul calls this a dispensation of the grace of God 3:2 , a stewardship of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen that Satan s injection has no administration or stewardship because he subtly injects himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But God is working Himself into His chosen ones by a sweet, intimate stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul s ministry was such a stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was a model of the dispensation of grace, of the dispensing of God as grace into His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By this dispensation of grace, the dispensing of God Himself as our enjoyment, the factor of life is ministered into the chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the life factor gets into them, they are raised up and attached to Christ in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the dispensation that heads up all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the fall of man, God s dispensation came in, beginning on a very small scale.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With Abel we cannot see much of the dispensation of God as the life supply to His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With Enoch, however, there is a slight implication of such a dispensation, but it is not very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we come to Noah, we can see the dispensation of God as the life supply on a very small scale.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob we see a certain amount of God s dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, with Moses and the tabernacle there was an administration, a household arrangement, an intimate stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is clearly seen with Moses, Aaron, and the priests with the Levitical service.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Coming to the New Testament, we have the dispensation of life with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What a sweet, intimate stewardship there was with Him!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Throughout His ministry, He was dispensing God as the life supply to His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This intimate stewardship is continued with the Apostles, especially with the Apostle Paul, who had the stewardship of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In his ministry Paul was constantly dispensing Christ as life into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul s ministry was a sweet and intimate stewardship, a pleasant household arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul even taught Timothy how to behave in the house of God 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The way to behave in God s house is to have the household arrangement, an intimate stewardship, and to dispense Christ to all the members of God s household.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not by controlling or even by a governmental administration; it is by a sweet dispensation, an intimate stewardship, a very dear household arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By such a ministry the factor of life is imparted into the church people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By such a sweet, intimate stewardship the life supply is dispensed into the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more the factor of life is ministered to us, the more we rise up and become attached.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every time you receive the life supply you spontaneously rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no need for anyone to tell you to have fellowship with others, for you automatically long to be attached.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s way to head us up is to work Himself as the factor of life into us that we may rise up and be attached to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not by a governmental administration, but by a sweet dispensation, an intimate stewardship, a comfortable household arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through this dispensation, the life factor is ministered to all the members of the church that they may rise up and be attached in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the heading up in Christ.</S>
