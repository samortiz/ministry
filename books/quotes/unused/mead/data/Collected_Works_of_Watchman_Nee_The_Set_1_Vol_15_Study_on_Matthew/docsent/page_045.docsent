   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 5-6:The second kind of seed is the seed that fell on the rocky places.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These are places where there are rocks underneath and shallow soil on top.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The deeper the seed is sown, the later it will grow; the shallower the seed is sown, the earlier it will grow because the shallow one is the first to receive the sunlight.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>See verses 20 to 21 for the explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the condition of those who are revived especially through revival meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, in John 2, many believed into the Lord when they saw the signs which He did.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, their believing was different from the believing mentioned in John 3, and the Lord did not entrust Himself to them John 2:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many were crowding around the Lord, but not many touched Him Luke 8:43-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many zealous ones crowd around the Lord, but they do not touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who crowd around the Lord do so merely because of temporary excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, this kind of people is not yet regenerated, because the rocks have not yet been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ezekiel 36:26 says that those who are regenerated have their stony heart removed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who have not entered deeply will go out easily.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many can easily have a display, but actually they have not obtained anything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because they have no depth of earth, the seeds immediately spring up and can easily make a display.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord said that people of this kind do not have root in themselves but have rocks underneath the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their soil is borrowed from the outside, and the sprout is not life but a mere momentary display of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord said that they are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, trials and persecutions are for helping the believers to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the north winds are for helping the trees to grow firmly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the seed has no root, it cannot withstand persecution and affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the seed is rooted, the scorching of the sun will help the seed to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the seed is not rooted, the scorching of the sun will cause the seed to wither.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verses 7, 22:The people described in these verses are probably saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thorns grow without anyone sowing the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But wheat does not grow if no one sows.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, everything that is of God requires work; everything that is natural does not require work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be anxious and to be greedy for riches are very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is the word of God crowded in you?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you give the word of God sufficient room within you?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A person can be outwardly very busy, very rich, and very strong, but the most important thing is whether or not the word is crowded within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord's eyes do not look only at life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord always looks at the bearing of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sprout grows before men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the seed sprouts, there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if it does not bear fruit, the owner will not have gained anything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The truth of the kingdom of the heavens is that God wants to gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verses 8, 23:There is only one kind of seed; the difference is in the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The kind of soil you are is determined by you; no one can force you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Concerning the truth of the kingdom of the heavens, it is a matter of understanding, not believing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, spiritual revelation is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When a person has the practical seeing, then he can bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, the Lord does not pay attention to anything under thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A hundred is perfect, sixty is more than half, and thirty is not quite half.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the Lord does not pay attention to anything under thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The measure of death one has determines the measure of his fruitfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 24:"Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Take note that this parable is the first of the six parables of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the realm of this parable is somewhat broader.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It must include the outline of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The speaking was carried out at the seashore, and the interpretation was given in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The parable of the sower stresses the four different kinds of soil; this parable stresses the good seed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the first parable there is only one kind of seed, while in this parable there is only one field.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The previous parable is like a preface.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It does not say, "The kingdom of the heavens is or, has become like...," because the work He did on earth was received only by some people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This parable refers to that which took place after He did His work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the previous parable there is only one man; in this parable there are men sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The previous parable emphasizes man's heart, whereas this parable stresses the realm of work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As the sower in the previous parable is the Son of Man, so the sower in this parable also is the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The "field" is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In chapter twenty-eight the disciples were told to go to all the nations, that is, to go into all the world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is different from going only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The previous parable stresses only man's heart toward the Lord, while this parable stresses the preaching of the gospel to the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now there are no more boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This indicates that the realm of the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is as broad as the world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The church rescues people out of the world, and the kingdom of the heavens is a new sphere on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church comes out of the world, whereas the kingdom of the heavens goes into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, we can remove people from the church, but we cannot remove them from the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
