   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ONE WHO BURNED THE BULL AND THE GOAT OF THE SIN OFFERING WASHING HIS CLOTHES, BATHING HIS FLESH IN WATER, AND AFTER THAT COMING INTO THE CAMP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and after that he may come into the camp" v. 28 . This signifies that the one who is defiled by contacting anything related to sin must deal with his outward living and with himself as well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The significance here is thus the same as that concerning the one who let the goat go to Azazel.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Literally, "yourselves" means "your souls."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Israelites understood "afflict" here to indicate total abstinence from food, fasting cf.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isa 58:3, 5, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Leviticus 16:29 afflicting one's soul signifies mourning, repenting, and feeling sorrowful for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>XXI.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>NOT DOING ANY WORK</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The people were not to do any work on that day v. 29b , for it was "a sabbath of solemn rest" to them v. 31 . This signifies that redemption has been completely finished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is nothing left for man to do, and man should rest in the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we try to work for our redemption, we shall insult Christ and belittle His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since we have seen Christ's redemption, have received it, and are enjoying it, we should cease from our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this matter Martin Luther was right to revolt against the erroneous teaching of the Roman Catholic Church concerning working for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Complete redemption has been accomplished in a full way by Christ, and now we are enjoying it without any labor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>XXII.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shall be a perpetual statute for you to make propitiation for the sons of Israel for all their sins once a year" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>33-34a .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This signifies that the offering was unable to make man perfect and that it was only a shadow of the coming good things, until the Son of God would come to complete the full redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The "coming good things" Heb 10:1 refer to the things accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These good things are revealed in Hebrews 9 and 10, two chapters that give us the content of this point.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we have in Leviticus 16 is a shadow, not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reality, the body, of this shadow is Christ with all His accomplishments and achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The shadow helps us to appreciate the reality and to know the details of the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, we do not care for the shadow we care for the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We care for Christ and for all He has achieved and accomplished.</S>
