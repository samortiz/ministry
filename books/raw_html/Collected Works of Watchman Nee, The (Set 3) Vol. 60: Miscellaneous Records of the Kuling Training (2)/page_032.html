<h2 class="head1">HOW TO CREATE IN MAN A SENSE OF SIN</h2><p>Another way to preach the gospel is to create a sense of sin in man. We need to consider a few ways to preach about this matter.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning the Power of Sin</h2><p>Man's consciousness of sin grows; it develops gradually from a shallow state to an acute state. In order for our preaching to create a sense of sin in an unbeliever, we have to show him the power of sin. It is very easy to show an unbeliever the power of sin. We should ask the following questions: "Do you ever make a resolution to be good? Does a student ever make a resolution to study well? Does a child ever make a resolution to not provoke his parents to anger? Does a wife ever make a resolution to be one with her husband? The will is present in them, but the power to do it is not (Rom. 7:18)." We can ask young people who are addicted to gambling, opium, cigarettes, or alcohol if they want to be free from their habits. We have to show them that there is a power behind these things that binds them. The more a man tries to free himself from this power, the more bound he becomes. This is like a high jump athlete; the higher he tries to jump, the more he feels the force of gravity. The more a person tries to stop lying, the more he realizes the impossibility of stopping. The more a man resolves to not lose his temper, the more he realizes how hard this is. The more a person tries to not sin, the more he discovers the power of sin. The more he wants to be free from sin, the more he sins. In this way he discovers how great the power of sin is. It is exceedingly hard to do good, yet it is exceedingly easy to sin. However, if a man has the life of Christ, he receives a power to do good and a power to overcome sin. Many people are saved through this kind of preaching. Once a man knows the power of sin, he develops a consciousness of sin and senses the need for salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning the Contagiousness of Sin</h2><p>Many people have a strong sense of social responsibility. They are not conscious of their own sins, but they react strongly to others' sins. They abhor the sins of others. We have to tell them that when they sin, they damage those who are around them, in particular, their children. Every generation follows the pattern of the generation that precedes it. If we sin, the next generation will follow. If we smoke opium, our children will be addicted to opium. If we play mahjong, our children will learn to play mahjong. If we drink, our children will also drink. By not suppressing our own sense of sin, we pass this sin on to our children. If we are greedy for money or lose our temper easily, others, especially our children, will easily follow in the same thing. Although not many people will respond to this kind of preaching, some will. We can tell them that sin is contagious. It is especially contagious to our children. We can destroy them by our contagion.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning the Result of Sin</h2><p>The one who is damaged the most by sin is the sinner himself. Sin has fruit. The wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23a). Proverbs 8:36 says that those who sin against the Lord wrong their own soul. When a man sins, he reaps the fruit of sin to himself. Galatians 6:8 says that he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh. We should not think that we can get away with sin without reaping some fruit. The wages of sin is death. This verse has saved many people. Sin will reap the fruit of sin for the sinner. The result of sin will always fall back on the sinner himself. Some people have to be brought to this realization before they see the evil of sin. In describing this fact, we have to read the list of sins spoken of in Romans 1:29-31 and explain these sins one by one. This is like painting a portrait of a person; we have to bring out the true likeness of the man. Everyone likes to see a picture of himself. A gospel preacher has to sketch a picture of man and show him his true likeness. When we describe a man's sins one by one, the Holy Spirit will shine on him and convict him of his sins. Quite a number of people become conscious of their sins through this kind of speaking. If we can preach in this way, others will know that they are short. In order to speak about sin, however, we must live in God's presence and be under the light ourselves. We must receive the shining ourselves before we can enlighten others. Once a man sees the dominion sin has over him, his heart will turn, and he will seek for the Savior.</p>
