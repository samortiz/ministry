   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO SYSTEMATIZING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Certain religious teachers attempt to systematize the revelation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Under the influence of such systematic teachings, some suppose that since Christ is in the third heaven He cannot be elsewhere, particularly not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, the Bible says that Christ is both in the third heaven and in us as well Rom 8:34, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, although Christ is in us already, He is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that He is both here now and He is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I cannot reconcile this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I simply believe both aspects because the New Testament reveals both.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Recently a young man approached me and asked if I believed that the Lord Jesus was at the right hand of God in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I assured him that I did.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then he asked me if I believed that the Lord had been resurrected with a body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I told him that I definitely believed this also.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then I encouraged him not to systematize the truth of God s revelation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus entered the room where the disciples were gathered.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the doors were closed, He suddenly appeared in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Luke 24:37, They were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord said to them, Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have v. 39 . Certainly the Lord in resurrection still had a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How then was He able to enter that closed room?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead of trying to explain this or to systematize it, we should simply believe the plain word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Testament says that Christ is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As such an indwelling One, He is spreading within us and saturating us with Himself, seeking the opportunity to come out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the Bible also reveals that Christ is on the throne in the third heaven and that in His coming back He will descend to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of trying to reconcile the subjective aspect and the objective aspect of the Lord s coming, let us simply believe both because both are revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>EXPERIENCING THE INDWELLING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The problem many believers have is that they have been religiously indoctrinated regarding the objective aspect of the Lord s coming, to the neglect of the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They pay their full attention to the Christ in heaven and firmly believe in His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, they neglect the fact of the indwelling Christ, perhaps not even realizing that Christ is now within them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we are awaiting Christ s coming back from the heavens, we need to enjoy Him inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus said, Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me Rev 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord s word here indicates that He is here already.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How we need to experience the living, subjective, indwelling Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My burden is to minister such a Christ to the Lord s people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not to teach the saints how to interpret the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the use of knowing how to rightly interpret the Bible if we do not have a direct, precious, and intimate enjoyment of the living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How we must fight the battle so that all the children of God may have such an enjoyment of the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is our need in the Lord s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let us forget the ordinances and practices, and let us say, O Lord Jesus, I have not realized how much I need to take You as my life and as my person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lord, I open my being to You, and I take You as my life and as my person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I don t care about my concepts concerning the way to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I care only to have the living, intimate, and personal enjoyment of You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>GOD S CONCERN IN HIS ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regarding the church, we should have no intention of either imitating or of opposing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our only aim should be to enjoy the living Person of Christ and to inwardly experience Him more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not be concerned about practices, methods, or ways.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Consider as an illustration the various kinds of eating utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Chinese use chopsticks, the Americans use a knife and fork, and the Indonesians may use their fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not be concerned about what we eat with, but only about what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as people take the proper food into them, we should not be concerned whether they use chopsticks, a knife and fork, or their fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, some may boast that the best way is to use a knife and fork.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Spiritually speaking, we may do the same thing regarding the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may be proud of our way, but we may not have any food on our plate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let us not care for spiritual table manners; let us care only for spiritual eating.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many of us were starving for years because we cared only for manners, not for food.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In so many religious groups everything is well-mannered and in excellent order, but there is no food for the Lord s people to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, in His recovery today the Lord is recovering the food on the table, not the manner of eating the food.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In His economy God is not concerned about utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His concern is that we experience Christ s sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only as we experience Christ in such a way will He be able to present a glorious church to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Praise Him that the process of this presentation is inwardly taking place day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May we all see that in His economy God cares not for forms or practices, but only for His dear Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May we all receive mercy to experience and enjoy Him.</S>
