   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Glorifying Their Father Who Is in the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eventually our shining will give glory to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens" Matt 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The title "your Father" indicates that the Lord Jesus is speaking to those who are regenerated children of God John 1:12; Gal 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The good works here are the behavior of the kingdom people through which others may see God and be brought to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our shining will glorify the Father because it expresses what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To glorify God the Father is to give Him the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Glory is God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the kingdom people express God in their behavior and good works, men see God and give glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God hidden is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when God is expressed, that is the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If as the kingdom people we have such a shining light, God will be expressed in this shining, and all those around us will see the glory, God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When others see God in our shining, that is the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>G. A CITY SITUATED UPON A MOUNTAIN</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Matthew 5:14a the Lord Jesus says, "You are the light of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then in 14b He goes on to say, "A city situated upon a mountain cannot be hidden."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the shining light, the kingdom people are like a city situated upon a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some may wonder why the Lord Jesus uses a city on a mountain as an illustration of the believers as the shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are in the building of the church in a practical way, we shall realize that only by being built together can we be a city situated on a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This city becomes a shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The saints in the churches are now grouping together in their neighborhoods.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If this practice becomes prevailing and the saints in these groups are built together, every group will be a part of the shining city situated on a mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The light in 5:14 is not an individual person; it is a builded city.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that the kingdom people need the building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the saints in the church in your locality are not built up, but are scattered, divided, and separated, there is no city there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And as long as there is no city, there is no light, because the city is the light; the light is not an individual believer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The light is a corporate city built up as one entity to shine over the people surrounding it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to shine upon others outwardly, we need to be built up as a city on the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every local church in the Lord's recovery must be a builded city.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the book of Revelation the churches are golden lampstands Rev 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The principle of the city and the lampstand is the same: neither is individual; both are corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The lampstand, like the city, is not an individual believer but the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are outside the church, we are not a part of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to be a part of the lampstand, we must be built into the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The local church, which is the lampstand, is likened by the Lord to a builded city set on the top of a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are built up in our locality, we shall be on the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if we are scattered, separated, and divided, we shall be in a low valley.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In every locality there must be one lampstand, one city situated on a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this, we need to keep the oneness and remain one entity, a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we shall be able to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if we are divided, we are finished with the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we have truly been built together, we shall be the city on a mountaintop shining upon those around us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Elevated above All the Surroundings</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The city situated on a mountaintop is elevated above all the surroundings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Impossible to Be Hidden</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus says that the believers as a city situated upon a mountaintop cannot be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is impossible for such a light to be hidden.</S>
