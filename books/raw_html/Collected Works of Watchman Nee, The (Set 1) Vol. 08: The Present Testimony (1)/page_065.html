<H1 CLASS=TITLE>CIRCUMCISION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 18</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Col. 2:10-13; Gen. 17:1, 9-14, 22-23</H1><P>We have read Colossians 2:11: "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ." This verse makes us realize one thing: Christians are circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands. This is to say that one portion of the inheritance in Christ is the circumcision in Christ. In order that no one miss the meaning of circumcision, we should turn to Genesis 17 where the matter of circumcision was first mentioned in the Bible. If we understand what is there, we will understand Colossians 2:11.</P><P>Before speaking of circumcision, we need to know some history about Abraham. In Genesis 17, Abraham was ninety-nine years old (v. 1). Prior to this, before he was eighty-six years old, God promised Abraham that he would be granted a son. Not only would he have a son, but he would be a father of a nation as well. Abraham, knowing that he was becoming old and that Sarah was past the age of child-bearing, did not have the slightest hope. Therefore, Sarah suggested that he take Hagar as a concubine. They wanted to help God with their flesh, thinking that by so doing they could bring forth a son. Abraham took Sarah's word, and at the age of eight-six, he brought forth a son, Ishmael (16:16). In this situation, what did God do? God did not want man to act in this way. God did not want Abraham and Sarah to help by the flesh. Since they depended so much on the flesh, God left them in the cold. During a period of thirteen years, from eighty-six to ninety-nine years of age, there was nothing worth recording, that is, Abraham had no fellowship with God. Abraham, at the age of eighty-six, still had the strength to do something; by the age of ninety-nine, he had no more strength. There was no more hope. God brought him to such a point before He came to make a covenant with him, that all the males should be circumcised. One year after the making of the covenant, Sarah brought forth Isaac. First circumcision came; then Isaac came. Without circumcision, there could be no Isaac.</P><P>From this background we can understand why God instituted circumcision. What God did was contrary to Abraham's doing. At the age of eight-six, Abraham could still use the strength of the flesh and the method of man. At the age of ninety-nine, he had lost even the slightest hope in himself. If anything was to be done, it would have to be done by the Almighty God. The first time the term Almighty God is used in the Bible is in Genesis 17:1. By this time Abraham was able to realize that unless the Almighty God did something, man was totally powerless. This is the meaning of circumcision. Now let us look at the aspects of circumcision one by one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PUNISHMENT OF UNCIRCUMCISION</H2><P>Verse 14 says, "And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant." You must remember that God cannot reckon those who are uncircumcised as His people, nor can He have any dealings with them. They cannot be reckoned as the descendants of Abraham, nor can the covenant of Abraham reach them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NATURE OF CIRCUMCISION</H2><P>Verse 12 says, "And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations." Circumcision is to cut off a piece of skin from man. Please consider: when God sees that a man is born, why would He want to cut off a piece of skin from him? Is not the birth of the child the creation of God? Yes. Since God gave life to the child, why does He want man to do an additional work of cutting off a piece of skin? Why would God not cause the child to be born circumcised? Why is it necessary for man to do the circumcision? What does it mean that circumcision is to be done on the eighth day? We know that the eighth day is the day of the Lord's resurrection. Being circumcised on the eighth day means putting off the lusts of our flesh through the resurrection of Christ. The meaning of circumcision is to put off the lusts of the flesh.</P><P>Why did God not ordain man to be circumcised on the day of his birth, rather than on the eighth day? Here we see the difference between creation and redemption, the difference between the natural and the resurrected. We all understand the gospel. Does a man become a Christian by receiving spiritual life right after he is born? According to the Bible, a child born of even the best couple still needs regeneration. This is because a person born naturally only has the power of God's creation in him; he does not have the power of God's redemption in him. Man has been created by God, but man does not have the resurrection life, the life of God. The most adorable thing in the whole world is a newborn baby. A child that is just born is the most undefiled. However, on the eighth day, if he is not circumcised in Christ, he will be cut off.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, perhaps you are naturally very nice, meek, and without any entanglement of sin. Perhaps you feel that your morality is better than others. But if you are not circumcised, you are not one of God's people. If a newborn child needs to be circumcised, how much more do you and I need the same? Eight days after a child is born, he has to be circumcised. What about you and I, who have been on this earth for more than ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years? We do not know how much filth our hands have touched and how much mud our feet have touched. Even more we need to be circumcised on the eighth day! None of us can see God according to our natural condition. Without circumcision, regardless how many sermons we have heard, we will still eventually perish. According to man's natural condition, we are destined to perish.</P>
