   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Food for God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was a Christian for years before I realized that God needs food.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was not aware that God is hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then one day I read Numbers 28:2, which says that the burnt offering is the bread of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The burnt offering is food for God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is hungry; God needs something to satisfy Himself, and this something is the burnt offering offered by His people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do you satisfy God day by day?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God commanded the children of Israel to present the burnt offering every day both in the morning and in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God needs this kind of food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Christians may talk about glorifying God, but God would reply that He is hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He needs food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may say that you will go to the mission field to glorify God, but God would say that He desires food from you today right where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can we know that we are offering food to God?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is when we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we are satisfied, surely God is satisfied by the food we offer Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If God is not satisfied, we can never be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So many missionaries are working day and night on the mission field, but are not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they would be honest, they would say that although they are doing much work to glorify God, yet they are so hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That is a strong proof that God is also hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God needs food, and that food is just the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must be absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we offer Christ as our burnt offering, we have the deep conviction that we are satisfied, and our satisfaction is just a proof of God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Life for Self and the Life for God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must be clear which life is the life that is absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our life is just the life for self; it is not a life for God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regardless of how much we train ourselves to be for God, eventually we will be just for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In principle it is similar to a monkey which has been trained to eat like a man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regardless of how much you train him to eat food in a human way, eventually the monkey will revert to his own way, because he has only the monkey life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How can a monkey behave like a human if he does not have the human life?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same way, our life is a life for self and not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have heard others saying that a certain person is self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may say that that person is self-centered, but I will ask, "What about you?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am not worried about that person being self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am the same.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a sense, we may be more self-centered than the person of whom we are speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose I ask the wives if their husbands are self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If they say that their husbands are self-centered, then I would ask whether the wives are self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are all self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no need to condemn others for being self-centered; we are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is another life we can experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can be one with Him; we can rely upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can be one with Christ as our burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is the life in us which is absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our life may be self-centered, but His life is God-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Handling of the Burnt Offering</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the record of Leviticus 1, those who present the burnt offering must kill it, flay or skin it, and cut it into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then they must wash all the inward parts and the legs with all the other parts that must be burnt.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But we must realize that we are unable to kill, to skin, and to cut into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our life is unable to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The life for killing, for flaying, for cutting, and for washing is altogether Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do you think that you can cut yourself into pieces?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You cannot!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is only one life which is able to do this, and that is Christ.</S>
