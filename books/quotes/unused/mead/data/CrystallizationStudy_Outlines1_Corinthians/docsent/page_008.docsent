   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Eight The Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Means of the Divine Administration Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:12-27 The apostle s dealing with head covering concerns the Head; his dealing with the Lord s supper the Lord s table concerns the Body 11:3, 17-34: Regarding the headship of Christ, which represents God and is represented by man, we must keep the divine governmental order ordained by God, without any disorder.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regarding the Body of Christ, we must be properly regulated by the apostle s instruction, without any confusion or division.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Head is Christ, and the Body is the church v. 3; 1:2; 12:27 ; these two Christ and the church are the controlling and directing factors of the apostle s dealing with the confused and disorderly church: In chapters one through ten Paul deals with the church s problems first by stressing Christ as God s center and our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapters eleven through sixteen he emphasizes the church as God s goal and our concern.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both Christ and the church are crucial to the carrying out of God s administration in His New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The unique mystical Body of Christ is the means for God to carry out His administration Rom 12:4-5; Eph 1:22-23; 1 Cor 12:12-13, 25, 27; 11:29: The mystical Body of Christ is thoroughly and absolutely related to God s administration; apart from the mystical Body of Christ, God has no means, no way, to carry out His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s eternal purpose is to have a group of saved and regenerated people who have become one to be an organic Body to carry out His administration Eph 3:10-11; 4:16; 1 Cor 1:2; 12:12-13, 27.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The mystical Body of Christ, the church, is for Christ s move on earth; the Head is now operating God s administration through the Body 11:3; 12:12.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Divisions damage the mystical Body of Christ with respect to the carrying out of God s administration 1:2, 10-13; 12:25, 27: Satan s subtle device is to cut the Body into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For centuries God has not been able to carry out His administration because the unique means for this the mystical Body of Christ has been cut into pieces through division.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because we realize that the carrying out of the divine administration requires the unique Body, the mystical Body, we hate division and are absolutely opposed to it 1:10; 12:25; Acts 20:30; Rom 16:17-18; Titus 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order that God s administration may be carried out, we must care for the oneness of the unique mystical Body of Christ Eph 4:3, 13; John 17:21-23 ; having such a concern will preserve us in the Body and keep us from any division.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We take care of God s administration by discerning the Body 1 Cor 11:29: To discern the Body is first to realize that Christ has only one mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we have the proper understanding of the Lord s supper, we shall not be divided by anything; rather, we shall remain in the unique mystical Body of Christ, the means for Christ to carry out His heavenly ministry for the accomplishment of the divine administration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Body of Christ is the corporate Christ 12:12-13: In verse 12 the Christ refers not to the individual Christ but to the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ: The corporate Christ is composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body with all the believers as His members.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the believers in Christ are organically united with Him Rom 12:4-5 and constituted with His life and element Col 3:4, 11 and have thus become His Body, an organism to express Him; hence, Christ is not only the Head but also the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible considers Christ and the church as one mysterious Christ Acts 9:4-5: Christ is the Head of this mysterious Christ, and the church is the Body of this mysterious Christ; the two have been joined to become the one mysterious Christ Eph 5:32.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the saved ones in all times and all space added together become the Body of this mysterious Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the reality of Christ is the Spirit, the way to be constituted with Christ to be His Body is to drink the Spirit 1 Cor 12:13: The baptism into the one Body has positioned us all to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By drinking of the Spirit we are constituted to be the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Blending is the most helpful thing in keeping the oneness of the Body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>24-25: The universal Body of Christ is a blending of all the local churches in the divine life Col 4:15-16; Rev 1:4, 11; 2:7a.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The goal of the universal blending is the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Blending requires us to be crossed out and be by the Spirit to dispense Christ and do everything for the sake of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Blending means that we should always stop to fellowship with others; to have fellowship is to put away our private interests and join with others for a common purpose the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem 1 John 1:3; Eph 4:16; Rev 21:2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the spiritual element all the churches should be blended together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The one Body is the one church of God, manifested in many localities as many local churches Eph 1:22; 1 Cor 10:32b; 1:2; 12:27; Rev 1:4, 11: The local churches are many in existence but are still one Body universally in element Eph 4:4.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the local churches are and should be one Body universally, doctrinally, and practically 1 Cor 4:17; 7:17; 11:16; 14:33; 16:1.</S>
