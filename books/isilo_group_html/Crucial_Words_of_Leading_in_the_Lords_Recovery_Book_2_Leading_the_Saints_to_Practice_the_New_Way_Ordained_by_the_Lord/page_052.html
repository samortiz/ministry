<p>We may encounter a situation in which some brothers love to expound the Bible; they are the Apolloses of this age. In the beginning of Acts, Peter and a group of brothers carried out the ministry; later, the apostle Paul and some other brothers began to carry out the ministry. These two groups of people were positive. However, in Acts 18:24-25 Apollos suddenly appeared. He was eloquent and powerful in the Scriptures, expounding the Scriptures very well. Although he was well versed in the Scriptures and spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, he only knew of the baptism of John; he did not know God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The ministry of the New Testament includes the ministry of John the Baptist. It is the first part of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This economy is an arrangement; as an arrangement, it is divided into several parts. For example, in a building containing five stories, those on the third floor are in the building as well as those who are on the second floor. Although they are in the same building, they are in different parts of the building. John was in the beginning of the New Testament economy. He merely touched a small portion of the New Testament economy of God. Only John and his disciples should have been in that part; those who came after them should not have remained there.</p>
<p>The ministry of John the Baptist is part of the New Testament ministry. It took place before the Lord Jesus began to preach and had come to an end by the time of Apollos. The official beginning of the New Testament economy took place after the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus. He said, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19). When John the Baptist came, he baptized people merely into water (3:11). At that time there was not yet the way to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, because the process through which the Triune God was to pass had not yet been accomplished. Once the Lord passed through death and entered into resurrection, He was no longer merely the perfect Triune God but the consummated Triune God. Hence, He was able to tell people to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God. This is the complete New Testament economy.</p>
<p>When Apollos appeared, chronologically he was in the latter stage and should have been fully in the New Testament economy. However, because he was taught inadequately, he did not enter into the New Testament economy. Consequently, he mostly taught people to know the Old Testament. Although he was well versed in the Scriptures, he knew only the Old Testament and the beginning of the New Testament, that is, the story of John the Baptist. In John 3:26 the disciples of John the Baptist had problems and quarreled with the disciples of the Lord Jesus. The disciples of John the Baptist said to John, &ldquo;He who was with you...of whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him.&rdquo; The disciples of John complained to John that everyone was following Jesus instead of coming to John to be baptized; this indicates that they had problems. Moreover, in Matthew 9:14 they went to ask the Lord Jesus, &ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo; Obviously there were problems between John&rsquo;s disciples and the Lord&rsquo;s disciples. This demonstrates that if someone remains at the beginning, he will have problems with those who advance. Hence, no one should remain at the beginning stage. This was the problem in regard to Apollos.</p>
<p>We may also encounter this kind of problem. A brother may know the Bible very well, but he may not have a clear picture of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and he may merely enter into one particular point at the beginning, adhere to that point, and thus becomes a problem. How should we deal with this kind of person? Paul&rsquo;s attitude was not to reject but to forbear. According to the Bible, the problem with Apollos was never completely solved. In 1 Corinthians 16:12 Paul told the Corinthians, &ldquo;Concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.&rdquo; This shows that Paul was very concerned about the church in Corinth. In 1 Corinthians Paul may be likened to a father who has just disciplined his children severely; hence, they were not happy. As a result, he asks the mother to go and see the children, yet the mother says, &ldquo;I do not want to go. I will go when it is convenient for me.&rdquo; Apollos had this kind of attitude.</p>
<p>I believe all parents have similar experiences in regard to disciplining their children. After the father spanks the children, and the children are in pain, the father&rsquo;s heart is also in pain; however, since the father has just disciplined them, it is not easy for him to say anything to the children. Thus, he asks the mother to serve as a buffer to warm and cherish the children. This was Paul&rsquo;s intention. In 1 Corinthians Paul severely disciplined the Corinthian believers in the first few chapters. As a result, in chapter 16 he spoke of Apollos because Paul wanted him to go and see the Corinthian believers. Sadly, Apollos was not willing. Although Paul felt that Apollos should go, Apollos did not feel the same way. His attitude did not reflect Paul&rsquo;s sense of urgency. Rather, he would come when there was opportunity. To Paul, the present was the best opportunity.</p>
<p>This portion of the Scriptures is precious because it shows that although Paul was a leading one, he never controlled the co-workers. He did not say, &ldquo;Apollos, you must go to Corinth; you have no option.&rdquo; Paul left the matter in God&rsquo;s sovereign hand. He felt that if this matter were of the Lord, Apollos would go to Corinth promptly; if Apollos would not go, then this matter must not be of the Lord. Paul was very concerned about the Corinthian believers. When he wrote 2 Corinthians, he was caring for the Corinthians to the uttermost. He told them that when he came to Troas, although a door of the gospel was open to him in the Lord, he was not able to do anything because he was anxious to see Titus, who had just gone to see the Corinthian believers; thus, Paul promptly went to Macedonia to wait for Titus (2:12-13).</p>
<p>Paul anxiously cared for the Corinthian believers, but Apollos was not as concerned about them; in this regard, he was more like a stepmother. We may liken him to being Paul&rsquo;s wife but not the birth mother of the Corinthian believers. After the father spanks the children, a real mother, without waiting for the father to say anything, will quickly go to comfort the children. At the same time, she will tell the children that the father&rsquo;s spanking was right. Hence, before the father asks, the mother has already warmed up the children. If Apollos had done this, he would have been a genuine co-worker of Paul; this would have also indicated that he knew the New Testament economy and carried it out together with Paul. However, this was not the actual situation. Although Apollos was a co-worker of Paul, he was not in the same move, the same economy, with Paul.</p>
<p>It is a rare opportunity for us to have this kind of fellowship. Although we may have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for many years, we may not be clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s way or the different kinds of people in relation to the ministry. According to 1 Corinthians, the Corinthians regarded Apollos on the same level as Paul and Cephas. First Corinthians 1:12 says, &ldquo;Each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas.&rdquo; This proves that Apollos&rsquo;s gift in preaching and expounding the Scriptures was not inferior to Paul&rsquo;s; however, he did not have an adequate knowledge of the entire economy of God. This is the problem we encounter today, and we need to have some understanding concerning these matters.</p>
<p>The New Testament ministry is for the building up of the Body of Christ. When Apollos was working in Corinth, he must have thought inwardly that he was building up the Body of Christ. However, in his feeling, was he the same as Paul? In Apollos&rsquo;s feeling and view, was he able to say, &ldquo;I, Apollos, am not doing my own work; rather, I am building up the Body of Christ with Paul, all the other apostles, and all the saints&rdquo;? We should ponder this matter to consider whether Apollos indeed had the same feeling as Paul. I believe that perhaps there was a little of the same feeling in Apollos as in Paul with regard to the building up the Body of Christ; nevertheless, I do not believe that his feeling was as strong as Paul&rsquo;s feeling. To illustrate with colors, Apollos&rsquo;s feeling may be compared to a light red, while Paul&rsquo;s feeling may be compared to a dark red; the difference is a matter of the degree of depth.</p>
<p>I deeply believe that Paul&rsquo;s feeling, even his every cell, could testify that what he did was not his own work but was for the building up of the Body of Christ. I am afraid that this feeling of building up the Body of Christ had not penetrated Apollos as deeply. Nevertheless, he must have felt that he had accomplished a work. If someone among us feels that he has accomplished a work, its value is questionable. We should not have this kind of feeling. We should have a common, deep, and penetrating feeling that we are simply building up the Body of Christ, not that we are accomplishing some kind of work. The only work we should be accomplishing is the building up of the Body of Christ. We should have the feeling that we are only building up the Body of Christ with the other brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACCORDING TO THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
<p>Today we are carrying out the one ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ, but what is the basis of our building? The Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists, and Seventh-day Adventists all carry out their work according the regulations of their particular denomination. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we should be building up the Body of Christ according to the teaching of the apostles, which is the entire New Testament. We must carry out the New Testament ministry according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching (Acts 2:42).</p>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching takes the New Testament economy as its center; this New Testament economy is Christ and the church. Ephesians 5:32 says, &ldquo;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&rdquo; In fulfilling our ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, do we take Christ and the church as the center? Or is baptism our center? Although we have baptism, it is not our center. Are the elders our center? Although we have elders, they are not our center. Is the expounding of the Scriptures our center? Although we have rich Life-study messages, they are not our center. Our center is the all-inclusive Christ, who is God yet man, having both divinity and humanity. He became flesh, passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living, experienced death, entered into resurrection, ascended to the heights, became the life-giving Spirit, and now enters into those who believe into Him, making them His members to constitute His Body, that is, the church. Moreover, He will come back to bring in His kingdom and consummate the New Jerusalem. This is God&rsquo;s economy.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 2: Leading the Saints to Practice the New Way Ordained by the Lord &nbsp; pg 52</div><br></body></html>
