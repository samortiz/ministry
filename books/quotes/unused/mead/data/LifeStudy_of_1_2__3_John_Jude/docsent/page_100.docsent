   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE THE PRINCIPLE OF ANTICHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are four verses in his Epistles where the apostle John speaks of antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:18 he says that many antichrists have come; in 2:22, that the antichrist, the liar, is one who denies the Father and the Son; in 4:3, that the spirit of the antichrist does not confess Jesus; and 2 John 7, that the deceivers who have gone out into the world are antichrists.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these four verses we can see that there is a principle of antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is an antichrist in principle?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to answer this question, let us consider 2:18, Young children, it is the last hour, and even as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come; whereby we know that it is the last hour.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse implies a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anyone who practices this principle is in the category of antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the time of the apostles, there was much talk about the coming antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John refers to this when he tells those who received this Epistle that they heard that antichrist is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then he immediately goes on to say that many antichrists have come.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fact that there have been many antichrists implies a principle, the principle of antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>DENYING WHAT CHRIST IS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 2:22 we can see more clearly what the principle of antichrist is: Who is the liar if not he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the antichrist, who is denying the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I would call your attention to the word denying used twice in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse speaks of denying that Jesus is the Christ and also of denying the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we have the principle of antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The principle of antichrist is to deny what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What principle must one follow in order to be an antichrist?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He must follow the principle of denying what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jesus is the Christ, Christ is the Son of God, and the Son of God is the embodiment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To deny any aspect of this truth is to deny something of what Christ is and thereby to follow the principle of antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The principle of antichrist is to deny something of Christ s Person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to 2:22, the antichrist denies that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we have seen, this was the heresy of Cerinthus, who separated the earthly man Jesus from the heavenly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He considered Jesus the son of Joseph and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Cerinthus also taught that after Jesus was baptized, Christ as a dove descended upon Him, but left Jesus at the end of His ministry so that Jesus suffered on the cross and rose from the dead, while Christ remained separated as a spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Cerinthus, therefore, denied that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As verse 22 indicates, this is also to deny the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the two sentences in verse 22 are put together, we can see clearly that to deny Christ is to deny the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because Cerinthus denied that Jesus is the Christ and thereby denied the Father and the Son, he was an antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is an illustration of the principle of antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What makes a person an antichrist, at least in principle, is that he denies some aspect of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>AGAINST CHRIST AND REPLACING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Greek prefix anti has two main meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, it means against; second, it means in place of, or instead of.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that an antichrist is against Christ and also replaces Christ with something else.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be an antichrist is, on the one hand, to be against Christ; on the other hand, it is also to have something instead of Christ, something that replaces Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By this we see that the principle of antichrist involves denying what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is to be anti-Christ, against Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, whenever someone denies what Christ is, automatically that person will replace Christ with something else.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, an antichrist is both against Christ and is one who replaces Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may use the modernists as an illustration of denying Christ and replacing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Modernists deny that Christ is the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not believe that Christ died on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead, they claim that Christ was persecuted for His teachings and was put to death because of His teachings and died on the cross as a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is clear that modernists deny that Christ is the Redeemer who died on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First, they deny this aspect of Christ s Person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then they go on to replace the Redeemer with a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this way, they have a martyr in place of the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is to have something instead of Christ as the result of denying what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must be careful never to deny anything of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should never deny any part, any aspect, or any item of Christ s Person.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To deny any aspect of Christ s Person is to practice the principle of antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some who hear this may say, I certainly am not an antichrist, for I am not against Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One may not be against Christ or deny Christ consciously.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But unconsciously we may deny some aspect of Christ s Person and then replace this aspect with something else.</S>
