<P>Let me tell you a story as another example of the leaven added to the meal. Five years ago some of us went to Jerusalem for a visit. One day our tour guide took us to the Mount of Olives. He showed us a big rock on the top of that mountain and told us that it was the very spot where the Lord ascended. He also showed us a big footprint which is supposed to be the footprint of Jesus. After I revealed to him that I am a person who knows the Scriptures, he admitted that all the stories he told us were superstitions. Yet so many people from far away places would go there on Easter Sunday to kneel and kiss that footprint. This is the leaven added to the ascension of Christ as the meal.</P><P>A number of Catholic cathedrals have a statue of Jesus placed at the entrance. The Catholics admit that that is not the real Jesus, but they say that it can remind people to receive Jesus. Again, this is the leaven mixed with the meal.</P><P>In the first four parables we see the line of the seed. The seed is of life and is good for food. In the first parable the seed is sown, in the second parable the seed grows up, in the third parable the seed grows up into something with its nature changed, and in the fourth parable something evil is mixed with the meal that comes out of the seed.</P><P>We may also say that with the first four parables there is the line of life. Christ came as the seed of life to be sown into us with the intention of growing something real. But at a certain point, there was a change in nature and consequently, there was a great change in appearance. Not only so, there was a corruption in element. The Lord came with the intention to sow Himself as the good seed of life, to grow as the true wheat, and to produce the pure meal. But the enemy came in to change the nature and appearance and to corrupt the element.</P><P>The fifth parable is that of the treasure hidden in the field (Matt. 13:44). The treasure must consist of gold and precious stones. Then in the sixth parable in Matthew 13:45-46, which we read at the beginning of this chapter, we have the pearl of great value. Both the treasure, consisting of gold and precious stones, and the pearl are not something created by God but are something transformed.</P><P>Here I wish to point out that, first, the church is produced out of Christ as life and, second, the church is produced out of the transformation of life. In the first four parables, the life is sown into us, and then in the fifth and sixth parables, there is the transformation of life. Now you can understand why in the New Jerusalem the city proper is of gold, the gates are of pearl, and the foundations of the wall and the wall itself are of precious stones (Rev. 21:18-21). This is what the Lord is seeking&#151;a building of gold, pearls, and precious stones.</P><P>I look to the Lord that in these days He will grant you the grace that you may see the intention of the Lord, the desire of the Lord, and the goal of the Lord. If you want to practice the church life, you must have a clear understanding of all these parables concerning the church.</P><P>In summary, Christ as the seed of life is sown into us for the transformation of life. We have nothing to do with the big tree and the leaven. Today we are under the transformation of life to become gold, precious stones, and beautiful pearls as materials for God's building. The Lord sacrificed all that He was and all that He had to obtain the precious materials for His building. He gave Himself up to buy the pearl of great worth. So today it is worthwhile for us to sacrifice everything and pay the price to realize the church life.</P>
