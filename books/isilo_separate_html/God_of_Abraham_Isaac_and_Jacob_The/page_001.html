These messages were published in Chinese in 1955 by the Taiwan Gospel Bookroom under the title, The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This book is a translation of the Chinese publication.</P><h1 class="title">PREFACE TO THE CHINESE EDITION</h1><P>God said, "I am...the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (Exo. 3:6).</P><P>In order to bring a group of people to come under His name, and in order to make them His people, God did a special work in three persons, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, respectively, and gave each one of them particular experiences. God gave Abraham the experience of knowing God as the Father, showing that everything comes from God. He gave Isaac the experience of knowing the enjoyment of the Son, showing that everything the Son has is from the Father. He gave Jacob the experience of the discipline of the Holy Spirit to deal with his natural life and constitute Christ into him.</P><P>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are the beginning of the history of God's people. As such, their total experience should be the experience of all of God's people. In publishing this book, we hope that the readers will find spiritual meaning in the experience of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in God's Word. May God bless this book and its readers and guide us to a full knowledge of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob so that we can become vessels of God's testimony.</P><P>The Editors<br>Taiwan Gospel Book Room<br>February 1955</P></td></tr></table></div><br>Home | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> </body></html>
