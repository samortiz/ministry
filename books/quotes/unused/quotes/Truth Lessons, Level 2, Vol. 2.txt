The first group of historical figures in the Old Testament also forms the first group of figures in the Bible, God's entire holy Word
The significance of this first group of historical figures is the essential significance of Genesis, the first book of the Bible
The most prominent of the characteristics that are manifested in man are love, light, holiness, and righteousness
God created Adam's inward nature and outward body according to His own image and likeness, that Adam might have God's image and likeness
He was just like a man's photograph, which bears the image and likeness of a man but is without the life and nature of that man
In this way he would be able to reach the goal for which God created man; that is, he would be able to declare and express God
After God created Adam, He authorized Adam to have dominion over all creatures in the seas, in the air, and on the earth
Because the earth was seized and usurped by Satan and became the place of his activities , it became a strategic place
All his actions, whether successes or failures, gains or losses, are related to and represent mankind and all things
Adam was the head of the old collective man ; whatever he did and whatever happened to him is participated in by all mankind
When Adam was created, all mankind, being included in him, was created as God's vessel to contain God and to express God's glory
Adam listened to his wife and ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan as the source of sin and death
He entered into an illegal union with Satan and received the evil nature of Satan, the nature that rebelled against God
Satan's evil nature became the sinful nature within Adam, and Adam was thus constituted a sinner condemned by God
Satan and the sinful nature entered all mankind, and all men were constituted sinners and were subjected under God's condemnation
We came out of him, and since his life and nature became sinful, the life and nature that we received from him also are sinful
Since Adam was the head of the woman, his wife, Eve, should have listened to him, and he ought to have stood in his position as the head
In Genesis 2 the Bible speaks in detail concerning the creation of the woman, and in Ephesians 5 it tells us that Eve refers to the church
Only the church, which is produced out of Christ through His death, can be unto Christ as Christ's counterpart and can be one with Christ
The church comes out of Christ and is created by God with the essence of Christ, not with the earthly essence of man
The blood is for redemption ; the water, typified by Adam's rib, is for the imparting of God's life as the essence that produces the church
According to the arrangement in God's governmental administration in the universe, man is the head of the woman
He caused her to assume the headship and to put her husband aside, thus making herself an independent unit in making decisions
She even seduced her husband to follow her in eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which resulted in death
She kept her position in receiving the promise of God's redemption; she followed Adam, her head, and received God's promise
After giving birth to Cain, Eve said, 'I have gotten a man from the Lord' , for she considered the child the seed of woman promised by God
By following her husband and receiving the promise of God's redemption, Eve returned to the position in which she was created
Adam and Eve were created by God as the first couple among the human race and as the first ancestors of all mankind
Adam ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and thereby included all his descendants in his sinning and becoming fallen
Through Eve, whom he considered as one who was qualified to have life and live, Adam begot generation after generation of descendants
Eve was made out of a rib taken from Adam's body and was unto Adam to be Adam's counterpart and to be one flesh with Adam
Eve kept her position in receiving the promise of God's redemption; she followed Adam, her head, and received God's promise
The second pair among the first group of historical figures in the Old Testament is Cain and Abel, who were two sons born of Adam and Eve
She considered Cain the seed of woman promised by God, the one who would bruise the head of the serpent, which had poisoned them
Cain would not be the one to bruise the head of the old serpent; rather, he would be a follower of the old serpent
It was not until four thousand years later that the virgin Mary gave birth to a child whose name was called 'the mighty God'
As a result, he was not accepted by God, he lost God, and he was driven away and went out of the presence of God
Eventually they became altogether godless they had nothing to do with God and they were without hope and were altogether empty in the world
To serve the ground is to earn a living, which is for the sustaining of one's own existence, not for God's purpose in His redemption
Cain is also the representative of all those who murder the real worshippers of God because of religious jealousy
One of the popes said that a person could redeem himself from his sin of murdering a Catholic if he killed a Protestant
He knew that as a fallen sinner he could not cover or conceal his sinfulness with his own works and by his own behavior
All who believe in God and take the way of God's redemption should care for God's purpose more than they care for their livelihood
In the divine revelation of the Bible, Abel and Cain represent two categories of people, the believers and the unbelievers
The two opposite ways taken by them represent the two opposite ways taken by mankind, the way of life and the way of death
He became the representative of all those throughout the ages who take God's way of redemption and life and who because of this are martyred
The Lord Jesus said to the Pharisees, 'I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes: some of them you will kill
According to his own preference he presented of the fruit of the ground an offering without the shedding of blood
He presented the firstlings of the flock as offerings with the shedding of blood and was thus justified by God
Enosh and Enoch are the third pair in the first group of figures presented in Genesis as seeds of the divine truths
Abel, who is of the second pair, indicates a man who takes God's way of redemption and life according to God's revelation
The name Seth gave to his son indicates that before naming him, Seth may have already begun to call on the name of Jehovah
Enosh as one who called on the name of the Lord became a model representing all those who call on the name of Jehovah and enjoy Gods riches
It is the joyful way to drink from the fountain of God's salvation, and the enjoyable way to delight oneself in God
Joel's prophecy was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost when all who believed were saved by calling on the name of the Lord
When Enoch was sixty-five years old, he begot a son, whom he named Methuselah, which means 'when he is dead it shall be sent'
According to Hebrews 11:6, Enoch believed not only that 'God is,' but that 'He is a rewarder of those who seek Him out'
In giving his son this name, Seth must have sensed the extreme fragility, impotence, and complete helplessness of fallen man
In this way, he became a model representing all those who call on the name of Jehovah and enjoy the riches of God
As a result, God rewarded Enoch with Himself as the eternal life and enabled him to escape death, to be taken by Him, and to not see death
Because Cain refused to take God's way of redemption and chose to go the way of death, he lost God and all the blessings that come from God
He became a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, a person who had no goal, no satisfaction, no rest, and no protection
The fact that he did not name the city after the name of God was a declaration that man had become independent of God
His descendants invented cattle-raising for making a living, music for amusing themselves, and weapons for self-defense
When man lost God and all that God was to him, he had to invent something for his own protection so that he might exist on the earth
Apparently, such a culture without God was invented by the man who refused to go God's way and thereby lost God
Its intrinsic factor was the instigation and incitement of Satan, God's enemy, within the man who departed from God
At the time of man's fall, Satan, the evil one, injected himself into man and embodied himself in sin to dwell in man's flesh
Acts 14:17 says that God is 'doing good, giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness'
Also, at the end of the millennium, God will judge and destroy the last group of people who follow Satan and rebel against God
Man invented a godless culture apart from God for self-preservation, self-support, self-amusement, and self-defense
The intrinsic factor that caused the formation of the godless culture was Satan's instigation and incitement within the man who had left God
The man who departed from God and refused to take God's way produced a culture that corrupted the entire human race
As far as spiritual representation and significance is concerned, among those who took God's way of life, Noah was the continuation of Enoch
He maintained and extended God's way of life so that God could carry out His plan on the corrupted earth according to His desire
Noah was saved before he began to build the ark, but he still needed to be saved further, from that corrupted world
That ark was the salvation that Noah built, which saved him not only from God's judgment but also from that crooked and perverted generation
That you may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation'
As the mighty God , He alone completed the work of creation, for He spoke, and it was done, and He commanded, and it stood fast
The principle is the same in God's building of the tabernacle, in His building of the temple, and in His recovering of the temple
Because Ham exposed the failure of the head of the family and the leader of mankind, he and his descendants received the curse
The tragic result was that they fell into all kinds of evil, such as rebellion against God, opposition to God, and the bringing in of idols
The tabernacle built by Moses, the temple built by Solomon, and the temple recovered by Zerubbabel and Jeshua, also are types of Christ
The work that they did in coordination with God was, in principle, the building of Christ, whom God intends to build in His economy
Even among the people on earth today, these two things are still in contrast to one another and are still going on
That salvation was the building of the ark and it saved Noah not only from Gods judgment but also from that crooked and perverted generation
It not only was prepared by God but also was worked out by those who took the way of redemption and life through their cooperation with God
He got drunk and became naked, losing his covering in the eyes of God and bringing a curse upon his son Ham and Ham's descendants
Ham, a son of Noah, received the curse by exposing his father's shame and thereby rebelling against the God-established authority
He built a kingdom beginning at Babel in the land of Shinar , and he also built the city of Nineveh in the land of Asshur
In giving man authority to rule over others, God did not intend for man to form nations; His intention was to maintain peace among men
After the flood, God had only one deputy authority on the earth, and that was Noah, who represented God, the true Head
As a result, they were judged by God-their language was confounded, and they were scattered throughout the earth
The kingdom that Nimrod built, beginning at Babel, was enlarged into the Babylon in the Old Testament at the time of King Nebuchadnezzar
The Bible reveals three aspects of Babylon the literal ancient Babylon the material Babylon the Great and the religious Babylon the Great
The woman is only gilded with these treasures as an ornament for outward display and a false appearance as a deception to attract people
Pember points out that even Buddha became a saint in the Roman Catholic Church under the name of Saint Josaphat
The Roman Catholic Church has become the mother of the religious prostitutes and the abominations of the earth
She will be condemned and cursed just as ancient Babylon was and will no longer be a fit dwelling place for human beings
Everyone who has been saved by grace must 'come out of her' that he may not 'participate in her sins' or 'receive of her plagues'
According to his genealogy, he was cursed, and according to the godless way that he took, he deserved death and God's destruction
As a result, they were judged by God- their language was confounded and they were scattered throughout the earth
Later, Babel developed into Babylon, which destroyed God's city and temple and was cursed by God, becoming an evil and devilish place
At the end of this age, Antichrist will persecute the religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church, annihilating her altogether
Abraham and Lot represent two categories of people who answer God's calling, and the two ways that they take with the two kinds of results
Those who answer Gods calling may take the way of faith by following God or they may take the way of turning back to the world by themselves
Those who take the former way are under a blessing, and those who take the latter suffer loss and receive a curse
Abraham, the father of faith, believed the God who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being
He obeyed and offered up Isaac , believing that God was able to raise him from among the dead, whence he also received him back in a figure
By faith he lived as a sojourner in the land, always pitching a tent and building an altar and calling on the name of Jehovah
His building an altar meant that he offered everything to God that he might have fellowship with God, worship God, and serve God
As a person who walked and lived before God, Abraham lived in fellowship with God as one who called on the name of Jehovah, the living God
God showed Abraham that, in order to accomplish His plan for the fulfillment of His purpose, Christ had to come and sin had to go
As a person who lived by faith in fellowship with God Abraham was able to overcome the striving of his brother and to give in to his brother
When his herdsmen strove with Lot's herdsmen, he trusted in God's care, not striving for himself or choosing for himself
God supplied Abraham's need in a timely manner, sending His priest, Melchisedec, to minister bread and wine to him and to bless him
In his fellowship with God, when he heard that God would destroy Sodom, he repeatedly interceded before God for Lot
As a result, when God overthrew Sodom, He remembered Abraham's intercession and delivered Lot from destruction
It was the precursor of the covenant of grace in the New Testament, and it was also connected with that covenant
Abraham was one who had faith in God, walked and lived by faith, lived in fellowship with God, and called on the name of Jehovah
He again used his old tactic and thereby exposed his hidden weakness, which was to sacrifice his wife for his own preservation
Although the Triune God is one, He became the God of those three persons-the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
His wife, however, became a pillar of salt , which is a sign of shame, and his two sons-in-law also were destroyed in the burning fire
He acted on his own and, still exercising his own choice, he begged the angels to allow him to flee to a small, nearby city named Zoar
Lot was a righteous man who believed in God, and he was also oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the Sodomites
Abraham and Lot represent two categories of people who answer God's calling, and the two ways that they take with the two kinds of results
By faith he dwelt in the land as a foreigner, and he believed God's word of promise: that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars
He lived in fellowship with God, and God considered him His intimate friend and supplied his need in a timely manner
Abraham overcame the striving of his brother and gave in to his brother, and he fought and interceded for his brother and was heard by God
Although he was a great man who had faith in God, he still had defects and weaknesses and was not fully mature in the spiritual life
Lot was never clearly called by God, but he participated in God's calling simply because he was willing to follow Abraham
He took the way of going back to the world, and he entered into Sodom, a city that was extremely wicked and sinful
Later, although he was rescued twice through Abraham, he did not go back to him to be helped again to follow God by faith
He took his two daughters with him and dwelt in a cave, where he was separated from his brother and was alienated from God
These aspects of his life became a model, serving as a warning to those who would later take God's way of life by faith
The situation of Sodom is the second aspect showing how utterly fallen and corrupted Noah's descendants became under the curse
The judgment by burning fire indicates that God as a consuming fire will destroy such corrupted people and will not tolerate their existence
Quite often in China, in front of the idol temples, where people worshipped idols, operas with stories of fornication were performed
During Noah's time, some of the fallen angels came to the earth and committed fornication with the daughters of men
These three places formed a triangular boundary around the land of Canaan, each side having its own attractiveness
Consequently, to the tenth generation their descendants were not allowed to enter into the congregation of Jehovah or to serve the Lord
Sodom was not only a place that brought man under the contamination of sin; it was also a place that brought man under a curse
Upon arriving at God's promised land, he should have lived with Abraham a life of pitching a tent and of building an altar
He should not have gone into any city in Canaan, that he might avoid being mixed with the cursed descendants of Canaan
The judgment of the flood was a destruction at that time mainly for the purging of the human race and the earth
The flood is related to Gods care for man because He caused the rain by which He cared for man to become the flood by which He destroyed man
Whatever does not correspond with His holy nature whatever is common unclean and sinful will be burned by the holy God as the consuming fire
After man's first fall, the way to the tree of life was guarded by a flaming sword; at God's last judgment, there will be the lake of fire
When God destroyed the earth by the flood, He was grieved for man ; when God consumed Sodom with burning fire, He was angry with man
When the two sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, offered strange fire before the Lord, fire went out from the Lord and devoured them
When Israel's king Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, sent two captains with their men to fetch Elijah, they were consumed by fire from heaven
Sodom was not only a place that brought man under the contamination of sin, but also a place that brought man under a curse
Ishmael was born of Hagar, Abraham's concubine, as a result of Abraham's accepting a proposal from his wife, Sarah
Ishmael, who was born of Hagar into slavery, could not inherit Abraham's possessions with Isaac, who was born of Sarah, the free woman
Isaac was the son born of Abraham by his wife Sarah, and he became the unique seed who inherited all the riches of his father
He was born not of blood nor of the will of man nor of the effort of the flesh but according to the Holy Spirit who is God reaching man
He inherited God's promise to his father, especially the promise concerning Christ, in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed
At a time when he had lost his mother, did not yet have a wife, and his servant had gone away from him, he was not troubled
When he encountered the trouble with the Philistines over the wells, he remained restful and did not contend with them
Wherever he went, even when he went downward, going south to the land of the Philistines, there was always a well for his enjoyment
When he was old, he still asked Esau to go out to the field to get some venison for him and make him savory meat, which he loved
From the beginning to the end, he was a man who inherited his father's possessions and restfully enjoyed all his father's riches
God gave the promise to Abraham, Isaac's father, saying that He would make him a blessing to all the nations of the earth
God considered this persecution the beginning of the four-hundred-year persecution of His people, the Israelites
As it was then, that he who was born according to flesh persecuted him who was born according to Spirit, so also it is now
After Isaac had grown up in order to test Abraham God told him to bring Isaac to the appointed mountain and to offer him as a burnt offering
They live a crucified life by being conformed to Christ's death, and thereby know and experience Christ and the power of His resurrection
As a historical figure in the Bible, Isaac, like Abraham, does not represent a complete, spiritually mature man
Consequently, Ishmael and Hagar were cast out by Sarah, and Ishmael was not allowed to be heir along with Isaac
Ishmael signifies those who keep the law by their self-effort, those who are under slavery and are born according to the flesh
He also inherited the promise given to Abraham concerning Christ, in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed
That is, Sarah symbolizes grace, which originally was to be given to man by God ; Hagar symbolizes the law, which was added later
The old covenant, symbolized by Hagar, is from Mount Sinai, which belongs to the law and brings forth children unto slavery
We are not children of the maidservant, Hagar, who symbolizes the old covenant, and we are not under the slavery of law
Rather, we are children of the free woman, Sarah, who symbolizes the new covenant, and we enjoy all the riches of Christ in grace
Sarah symbolizes the new covenant of grace that is she symbolizes the heavenly Jerusalem the Jerusalem above as the mother of the believers
Sarah, who submitted herself to her husband, is a negative model in the matter of proposing that her husband take Hagar as a concubine
Otherwise, they will produce 'Ishmaels' out of their flesh, who will lust against the 'Isaacs' born of God's promise
Afterward, when the old servant went to her house, he brought forth more articles of silver and of gold, and raiment, and gave them to her
After Rebekah received and enjoyed the riches, the old servant wanted to go back immediately to his master's place
The older one, Esau, was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, and the younger one, Jacob, was a quiet man who dwelt in tents
When Isaac was about to bless the firstborn son, she taught Jacob how to cheat his father in order to obtain the blessing
Eventually, Rebekah had no alternative but to send away the son whom she loved in partiality, that he might flee to her brother's place
In the Bible, the first, in the present sense, refers to that which is natural, of the old creation, and forsaken by God
In another example, the firstborn sons of the Egyptians were smitten by God , signifying again that the first is forsaken by God
Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; hence, he was the one most loved by his father according to the natural man
When Isaac was old, he still asked Esau to go hunting and make him savory meat, which he loved, so that he could bless Esau before he died
One day while Jacob was making pottage, Esau came from the field, and, feeling faint, he asked Jacob to give him some red pottage
Esau lusted after the enjoyment in the flesh, after the world and its worldly pleasures, and for a morsel of meat he sold his own birthright
In the Bible, the second, in the present sense, refers to that which is spiritual and that which is chosen and desired by God
Jacob, the younger son, the second, symbolizes the natural man who has been regenerated to become the spiritual man, who is loved by God
The promise that all the families of the earth would be blessed was given first to Abraham and then to Isaac here it was mentioned to Jacob
God gave Jacob this promise so that the promise given to Abraham and to Isaac might be established and continued in him
Jacob was one who inherited the promise, and all his descendants also were descendants who received the promise
When he seized Esau's birthright and the blessing of his father through deception, Esau hated him and wanted to kill him
The competing, envying, and wrestling between his two wives, Leah and Rachel, in childbearing put him in a predicament
His other sons came and spoiled the city, thus causing Jacob to be frightened and troubled and to have no peace
Also, he was deceived by his sons to think that his most beloved son, Joseph, had been devoured by wild beasts
All the sufferings in his circumstances were used by God to deal with Jacob from all sides that he might be transformed
Finally, in the matter of Joseph's being sold, Jacob was brought by God to a place where he no longer had any strength-he had become lame
Joseph was displeased and lifted up Jacob's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head and place it on Manasseh's head
Jacob's blessings became prophecies because his blessings were shining with light and fit in with God's purpose
As such, he symbolizes the natural man who has been regenerated to become a spiritual person, who is loved by God
He also inherited the promise given by God to Abraham and Isaac, namely, that all the families of the earth would be blessed in Christ
Among the twelve sons of Jacob, the most outstanding was Joseph, and the remaining eleven formed a separate group
Among these eleven, Reuben, Levi, and Judah had their special characteristics; the remaining eight were not special
Reuben, Levi, and Judah, with Joseph, all were related to the birthright inherited by Jacob from the forefathers
According to the governmental arrangement in God's economy, Reuben, the firstborn, should have inherited the birthright
Concerning Levi and Simeon, he said, 'In their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they hocked an ox
The children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men'
Thereafter, the sons of Levi were separated from their brothers to replace the kingdom of Israel in taking up the charge of God's priesthood
They could wait before God and could offer to God the fat and the blood of the sacrifices to satisfy Gods righteousness holiness and glory
In particular, he took care of Joseph, who was in tribulation, and prevented him from being murdered by his brothers
When Christ, as Shiloh, the One who brings peace, comes again, the whole earth will be filled with peace, and all nations will obey Him
At that time, the kingdoms of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever
He lived as a sheaf of life, was full of the riches of life, and was like a bright star shining in the darkness
Although he passed through various trials and sufferings, he was prosperous in all things because he had the presence of God
Eventually, he became the representative of all those who are mature in God's life and who reign for God and enter into glory
Joseph had two dreams in which he dreamed that his brothers, signified by sheaves and stars, were bowing down to him
Later, when Joseph, in obedience to his father's command, went to visit his brothers, they conspired against him and almost slew him
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob signify the three parts of the experience and life of a complete, spiritually mature person
These three parts of such an experience and life eventually produced a mature Israel, one who could reign for God
Joseph's reigning and ruling over Egypt signifies that all who are spiritually mature will reign for God and rule over the earth
At the conclusion of the age of grace, Christ will come back to take the whole earth and set up the millennial kingdom on the earth
He received the double portion of the land, signifying the enjoyment of Christ in full, as a portion of the birthright
