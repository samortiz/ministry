   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN THE CONTINUAL FIGHTING AGAINST AMALEK Scripture Reading: Exo 17:9-16; 1 Sam 15:1-33; Rom 8:7-8, 13; Gal 5:17, 24</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapters one through seventeen of Exodus form a complete section.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this section we have a full picture of God s salvation, a picture that includes both the dealing with the world and the dealing with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s chosen people were in bondage in Egypt, which signifies the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then God came in to deal with the world, to accomplish redemption, and to deliver His people from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Afterward, they enjoyed the supply of the heavenly manna and the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then, in Exodus 17, God dealt with Amalek, that is, with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have a bird s-eye view of the first seventeen chapters of Exodus, we shall see a picture of God s salvation which begins with the dealing with the world and concludes with the dealing with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This picture enables us to realize that, as God s chosen people, we once were under the tyranny of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But after we were redeemed, saved, and delivered, we began to enjoy the divine provision of manna and living water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day, however, we had to face a very subjective enemy the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This enemy seeks to trouble us, to occupy us, and even to destroy us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The next section of the book, chapters eighteen through forty, is a long section related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that after we have been delivered out of the world, have enjoyed the divine provision, and have dealt with the flesh, we shall be in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What good news this is!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps you have never realized that these chapters are related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your only realization may have been that these chapters cover the building up of the tabernacle as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is crucial to realize, however, that apart from the kingdom there is no possibility for God s house to come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only when we defeat the enemy, overcome the world, and deal thoroughly with the flesh shall we be in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the kingdom it is possible for us to build up the tabernacle as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The principle is the same with the building of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After David fought the battle against the enemies and gained the victory, Solomon enjoyed the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this enjoyment the temple was built.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the second section of Exodus, chapters eighteen through forty, we see that God s redeemed people were in the enjoyment of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Having been delivered from the world and having dealt with the flesh, they were able to build the tabernacle as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the New Testament, the Devil, the world, and the flesh are called the enemies of God Matt 13:25, 39; Rom 8:7-8; James 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Exodus Satan is signified by Pharaoh, the world is signified by Egypt, and the flesh is signified by Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After these three enemies have been dealt with, the kingdom of God comes in.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I. AMALEK THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>FULL OF ENMITY AGAINST GOD</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Old Testament no enemy is dealt with more thoroughly than Amalek, because Amalek is a type of the flesh, which is the last enemy against God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The flesh is what keeps the church from being built up adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as the flesh remains a problem, the kingdom cannot come.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The kingdom comes in only after the flesh has been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For the sake of the church life, we need to deal with our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the flesh is not dealt with, there can be no kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then without the kingship of Christ, His headship, there is no way for the Body to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the reason that, during the past nineteen hundred years, there has been very little building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The confusions and divisions among Christians today are primarily due to the flesh, to Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Among Christians Amalek is prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of this, we do not have the kingdom of God in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Without the kingdom, it is impossible to have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Among the vast majority of Christians, it is not possible even to speak about the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We thank the Lord that by His mercy and grace we in His recovery have learned something of the importance of dealing with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the flesh remains a problem, we dare not let our flesh be unrestrained.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We simply do not have the boldness to stay in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, many Christians are extremely bold to be in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How strong is Amalek today!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because Amalek prevails, there is no kingdom and no building.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In his writings Paul thoroughly deals with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He uses certain expressions to show that the flesh is enmity against God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, in Romans 8:7 he says that the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The flesh is ugly for the simple reason that it is not subject to the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>From God s point of view, the flesh is lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lawlessness prevails among many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The flesh is lawless in its inability to be subject to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 8:8 Paul goes on to say, And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The flesh is not subject to the law of God, it cannot be subject to the law of God, and it cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, in the eyes of God there is no place for the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It must be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The flesh denotes the totality of the fallen old man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, the flesh does not refer simply to part of our being, but to our entire fallen being.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to Romans 6:6, the old man has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because the old man is hopeless, God put it on the cross and crucified it with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As we shall see, we need to cooperate with God in what He has done by crucifying the flesh Gal 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The destiny of the flesh is to be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No matter how the flesh may appear to us, in God s eyes it is rebellious and despicable.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For this reason, God has decided to blot out the name of Amalek.</S>
