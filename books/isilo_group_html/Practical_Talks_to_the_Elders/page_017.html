<p>Again I say, to take this way to care for the church means that you have to sacrifice a lot. You cannot consider yourself. I have recently spent many, many hours between the millstones being ground. My wife spoke with me after some of these grinding talks. She reminded me of my age. I told her I surely realize my age, but I have offered my entire life for the recovery. If there is a problem that I know is not solved, even if I lie down on my bed, I have no rest. That is more damaging to my health than to spend hours and hours talking with those involved to help them solve it. To give this help becomes my joy. I would rather sacrifice my life to keep the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is my destiny. Don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t know how to take care of my health. If I had nothing to do for the Lord and were retired, I would surely take care of my health. But the churches around the world, especially the churches in the Far East, are my children, more precious even than my own children. How could I lie in bed resting, while they get drowned in the bottom of the ocean? I have to forget my health.</p>
<p>Brothers, I don&rsquo;t encourage you to sacrifice your health, your life, but in taking care of the church life do not consider your interest first. Set your interest aside. There is a slogan, &ldquo;Safety first.&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;The church first.&rdquo; And your local church first, of which you are one of the elders. Not your job, not your family. I don&rsquo;t mean that you shouldn&rsquo;t take care of your family, but I mean that the church should come first. Otherwise, brothers, I must predict that no church among us can be built up. I am pretty sure this prophecy will be fulfilled, unless you brothers who are elders sell yourselves not to the church but to the church where you serve. Always consider that church first. If you do, there will be no need for me to sit here talking to you. You will know how to learn. You will be able to figure out what is needed. Otherwise, we can only be the best of Christianity. We cannot have the real testimony on the central lane of the Lord&rsquo;s New Testament ministry.</p>
<p>Pray about this. And I beg you to pray for me. As the problems have come, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and with the brothers&rsquo; help I have borne the burden and the matters have been solved. I do realize, however, from another angle that this has been the enemy&rsquo;s attack, to keep me so occupied by one thing after another for the past month or so. I have lost the time when I would have been working on the notes, and my body has been somewhat exhausted. So pray for me. And pray for yourself, and pray for the church you take care of.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TROUBLES AND BLESSINGS</h2>
<p>Concerning the ministry station, I do want you to be clear about the relations and boundaries. Then we can all go on in a sweet, efficient way. It is His mercy that we have so many complications. Complications are a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. Children are a trouble, and they make life complicated for the parents. I have many children; I also have many brothers, both Chinese and American. I have also many churches and many co-workers. This means I have a lot of trouble. The same is true of the ministry station office. It is a blessing, but it also means I have a lot of trouble. Consider, however, without this office, how could my ministry be carried out? Yes, on the one hand, it is a blessing; on the other hand, it is a trouble. From the New Testament we know that Paul had these same complicated situations to take care of. My words to you are just for the carrying out of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Practical Talks to the Elders &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
