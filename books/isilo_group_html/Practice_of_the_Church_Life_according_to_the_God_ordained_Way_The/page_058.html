TO BRING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY ON ITS TRACK</H2><P>Although I have been speaking on the God-ordained way for seven and a half years, the "train" of the God-ordained way is still not on the track. In order to bring the God-ordained way on its track, we need to be those who take the definite steps of the practicing and learning of the God-ordained way, practicing each step one by one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Not by Promoting</H2><P>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is not by promoting. In our practicing and learning of the God-ordained way, we should not promote anything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Not by the Church's Arranging</H2><P>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is also not by the church's arranging. The church's arranging kills rather than enlivens. Hence, I advise the elders not to arrange anything. The church's arranging may seem to be a benefit, but it will not work for the long run.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Not by Big Meetings</H2><P>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is also not by big meetings. The elders should not call a meeting to give a lecture or a message to the audience. That does not work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. But by Individuals with Small Groupings</H2><P>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is by individuals with small groupings. The elders should take the lead and set up a pattern. They should be the head sheep in the flock. When the few head sheep take a certain way, all the flock follows. Likewise, when the head sheep stop, all the flock stops. In the practicing of the God-ordained way, there is a need to have the head sheep.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TO BEGIN BY PRACTICING ONE STEP ONLY</H2><P>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is to begin by practicing one step only. We are not able to take more than one step at a time. We cannot take the four steps all at once. This is impossible. Thus, we should limit ourselves to just one step.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Dive into It</H2><P>The way to practice one step of the God-ordained way is to dive into it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Find Out and Learn the Secrets</H2><P>In practicing any step of the God-ordained way, we need to find out and learn the secrets. Two people may drive the same car, but each has his own secrets concerning his driving. Everyone who drives a car has his own secrets in handling the car. The secrets can be found only by more practice. Some people enjoy driving; to them, driving is like a hobby. Thus, if they encounter difficulties in their driving, they are not bothered or troubled. Nothing related to their driving is a problem to them, because they have learned the secrets of driving. In the practicing of the steps of the God-ordained way, we need to find out and learn the secrets.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Not Caring for Problems, Hardships,<br>and Frustrations</H2><P>In our practicing and learning of the God-ordained way, we should not care for problems, hardships, and frustrations. If we would begin to practice one step of the God-ordained way, after a short time we may encounter a number of problems. However, if we care for these problems, we are finished. In doing anything we should not care for problems. If there is a will, there is a way. If this is our attitude, we will succeed. The more we care for problems, the more problems we will have. However, if nothing is a problem, a hardship, or a frustration to us, we will get through; we will have a way. We need to learn to believe this. This means that we are trusting the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. With Faithfulness, Endeavoring, Patience, Endurance, and Much Prayer</H2><P>In practicing the definite steps of the God-ordained way, we must do so with faithfulness, endeavoring, patience, endurance, and much prayer (Col. 1:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:58). Then we will reach our goal.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practice of the Church Life according to the God-ordained Way &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
