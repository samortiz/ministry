The brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes for corporate living are our invention. Although some in Christianity may have practiced this in the past, I did not learn this from them. I learned this way by our own experience. At a certain time I found that for the campus work we need brothers&rsquo; homes and sisters&rsquo; homes. Otherwise, after we catch a &ldquo;fish,&rdquo; we will have no vessel for keeping it.</p><p>At first, it did not seem easy to have the brothers&rsquo; homes. This practice started in the church in Taipei, which has practiced having the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes for more than twenty years. They have learned much and experienced much, and now they are enjoying a very big success. According to a recent letter I received, they have one hundred forty new trainees in the current term of the full-time training in Taiwan, most of whom are college graduates from the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes. The goal of those who catch and gain new ones on the campuses is to bring them into the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes. If they cannot bring a saved one into the homes, they feel that this is a failure. In the Orange County area, we have tried to practice the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes. The Lord afforded us some houses through some brothers who love the Lord. The church did not buy those homes, but certain lovers of the Lord bought a number of houses for this purpose. I did not go to see these homes, but word concerning them has come to me.</p><p>How to bring people from the campus into the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes is a big problem. We cannot simply tell students that we have a house closer to the school than their dormitory and that it is better for them to stay in our brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; homes. There is nothing wrong with this, but how can we keep them? This is a big problem. Recently in Orange County the number of young people in corporate living has been reducing in number, not increasing. I would like to fellowship with you that you should forget what you have been doing there. Let us learn a new way. To some extent, I do have a new way, which we have learned from the experiences we picked up in Taiwan.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM OF RECEIVING THE BELIEVERS</h2><h2 class="head2">Receiving Whom the Lord Has Received</h2><p>Recently some young people who live in the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes have said that there is a constant demand in corporate living with no supply and no help. This brings us to the principle of receiving the believers, which has been a big problem for nearly two thousand years. Brother Nee spoke with me about the problem of receiving others around 1948 when I was with him in Shanghai. This was a great matter in the Brethren practice. The first division among the Brethren was between John Nelson Darby and George M&#252;ller over a discrepancy of opinions. Darby said that all the believers who remain in the denominations are companions of evil. He believed that since all the denominations are evil, as long as one joins them, he is a companion of evil. Therefore, he would not receive anyone who still remained in the denominations. George M&#252;ller disagreed, pointing out his friend, Hudson Taylor, who was the founder of the China Inland Mission. M&#252;ller asked Darby if he could say that Taylor was a companion of evil. This caused the division between the so-called Closed Brethren and Open Brethren. Darby was the first of the Closed Brethren, while M&#252;ller was the first of the Open Brethren. The Closed Brethren went too far, even saying that if a husband and wife held different opinions, they should not eat together. Recently there has been another big division among the Closed Brethren. One faction says that the believers must examine everyone who wants to come to the Lord&rsquo;s table. Before receiving him, they have to study and investigate him. Otherwise, they cannot quickly receive him for the Lord&rsquo;s table. Others, however, say that the believers should simply leave this matter to the Lord and let Him take care of it. These two opinions have existed for many years.</p><p>The issue of receiving the believers eventually came to us in China. Brother Nee taught us that according to Romans 14 we have to receive all kinds of different Christians, whether or not they keep certain days and whether they eat meat or vegetables. We should not care for those issues or receive people based upon their keeping of days or their eating. Paul told us that since the Lord has received them, we also have to receive them. The Southern Baptists, however, do not receive someone unless he is baptized by them, not only by immersion but by their pastor and in their water. They are very strict and do not recognize any other kind of baptism. Baptism by immersion by their pastor and in their water is the requirement of the Southern Baptists for receiving people into their church life.</p><p>When we practiced the church life according to Brother Nee&rsquo;s teaching and according to the Bible, we also faced these problems. Therefore, when I came to this country in 1960, I spontaneously impressed the brothers that we must keep the Lord&rsquo;s table open. I realized that, especially in the United States, there are many believers who are not only saved and regenerated but who also love the Lord, and they are tired and disgusted with the practice of investigating a person about so many matters. I felt that we should not take this way. We have the Lord&rsquo;s table, and whosoever will may attend. Even today it is still the same with us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A Word of Love to the Co-Workers, Elders, Lovers, and Seekers of the Lord &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
