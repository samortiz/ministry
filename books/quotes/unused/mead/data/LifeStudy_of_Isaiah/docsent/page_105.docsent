   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. As Typified by Israel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ as the Servant of Jehovah was also typified by Israel for the carrying out of the kind word of comfort spoken by Jehovah to Israel Isa 41:8-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>C. For the Exposing</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>of the Falsehood and Vanity of the Idols</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to 41:21-29, Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is for the exposing of the falsehood and vanity of the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In chapter forty of Isaiah, Christ is the replacement for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since we have been replaced by Christ, we must realize that we are nothing a drop from a bucket, specks of dust on the scales v. 15 . God Himself is the only One in the universe who remains forever.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today God is embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As people who are withering grass and fading flowers vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>6-8 , we need to learn to come to the Word of God so that we may touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we receive the living and abiding word of God, we are regenerated, and we realize that we are part of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At such a time we can declare, as Paul did, that we have been crucified with Christ, and that it is no longer we who live but Christ lives in us Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is what it means to wait on Christ Isa 40:31 , that is, to stop ourselves, our living, our ambition, and our everything and to receive Christ as our life, our person, and our replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ then becomes everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In particular, He becomes our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaiah 40:31 reveals that as we wait on Christ, we are renewed and strengthened to such an extent that we mount up with wings like eagles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Bible, the wings of the eagle signify God's life power becoming our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we enjoy God in His life power, we mount up with wings like eagles to soar in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Anyone who is replaced by Christ and waits on Him to enjoy God's life power in grace is a servant of Jehovah.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are not servants of Jehovah apart from Christ, but they are servants with Christ and in Christ in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this sense, Cyrus, Israel, and Isaiah become Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today, as members of Christ, we also are types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For what purpose are we types of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the positive side, we are types of Christ for the purpose of carrying out Jehovah's kind word of comfort 41:8-20 , which is the gospel as His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the negative side, we are types of Christ for the purpose of exposing the falsehood and vanity of the idols 41:21-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the New Testament testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We testify two things: 1 that Christ is our reality, centrality, and universality and that we are part of Him, and 2 that everything except Christ is false, vain, and an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As types of Christ, we testify that we are nothing, that we have been fired and replaced with Christ, and that Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We also testify to the falsehood and vanity of the idols, the head of which is Satan.</S>
