In verse 24 the Lord then speaks of the matter of serving Him. In the matter of serving the Lord, a man has to be single. No one can serve both God and mammon. Verse 22 speaks of the eye being single, and verse 24 speaks of the service being single. Mammon is a serious thing. If a man wants to serve the Lord, he must be delivered from mammon. Those who are not delivered from mammon cannot serve God.</p><p>A single eye means an eye that is delivered from mammon. Only this kind of eye will enable one to see the truth. The truth is absolute; it has nothing to do with man. If a man does not know God, it is because his eyes are defiled and impure. In order for a man to know God, he must have eyes that are delivered from any defilements. An impure person cannot see the truth. In the eyes of a defiled person, everything is defiled. Such persons cannot see God.</p><h2 class="head2">Voluntary Poverty<br />as a Result of the Lord's Salvation</h2><p>A Christian should consider mammon as a menace, something that needs to be disposed of right away. He should drop it in the same way that he would drop a red-hot coal from his hand. A Christian's poverty should be voluntary. Some become poor through their environment. Others are poor because of their parents or other special circumstances. But there is a certain kind of people who are poor because they have met salvation. They have chosen to become poor. There is a big difference between this kind of poverty and all other kinds of poverty. This is like being a soldier in the army: Some are drafted, whereas others enlist voluntarily.</p><h2 class="head2">It Being Difficult for a Rich Man<br />to Enter God's Kingdom</h2><p>Why do we have to choose poverty? It is because the Bible says that it is difficult for a rich man to be saved. It is more difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle (Matt. 19:23-24). A rich man can enter the kingdom of God only with difficulty.</p><h2 class="head2">Mammon Being an Idol</h2><p>Mammon is an idol. Covetousness is the same as idolatry (Eph. 5:5; Col. 3:5). If you worked in an office and others tried to pay you with an idol or a golden calf, would you take it? Of course, you would not take it. But today many people do not realize that mammon is the same as idols. It does not matter what kind of money it is; as long as it is mammon, it belongs to Caesar.</p><h2 class="head2">The Testimony of Voluntary Poverty</h2><p>During the time of the apostles, the disciples gave up everything to follow the Lord. In church history there were tens of thousands of Franciscans who chose to live in poverty. We are often too careful concerning this matter. We are afraid that we will become too much. Actually, there are too many times in our life that we have been too much already. If you would not misunderstand me, I would say why not do it one more time and be a little bit too much in consecration. The founder of the Moravian movement, Count Zinzendorf, was an educated person, and he offered up all his material possessions. The number of missionaries this group sent out ranks the highest among all missionary groups during the past few hundred years. The Brethren do not like to advertise themselves, but many among them also chose the way of voluntary poverty.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_107.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_109.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 57: The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry &nbsp; pg 108</div><br></body></html>
