<p>Second, you have to ask yourself who is there or what is there all the time that you don&rsquo;t live Christ. Since you cannot say &ldquo;to me to live is Christ,&rdquo; you must say to me to live is my peculiarity. If you are not living Christ, you must be living your peculiarity. This is the case unless you are living sin or worldliness or the flesh. These things are easy to denominate and to designate. But if you are living something that you cannot designate, that you cannot name, you have to realize that is peculiarity. Peculiarity is always much better than sin or worldliness or the self or the flesh. All these things are easy to designate. But if you are living something that you cannot designate, no doubt that is peculiarity. Peculiarity is neither sin nor worldliness nor flesh nor lust nor Christ. You live something daily. To you to live is something daily. If it is not sin or worldliness or the flesh or Christ, surely it is peculiarity. Because you have never seen it, you have never condemned it. Yet what you are now proves there is such a thing. Now you do live something&mdash;not sin, not worldliness, not lust, not flesh, not disposition&mdash;but not Christ either. Because it is not apparently something bad you have never condemned it. This is your peculiarity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PECULIARITY VERSUS ONENESS</h2>
<p>Third, we need to see why we have opinions and why we are not absolutely one with others. The opinion, the dissension, the lack of absolute oneness with others comes from peculiarity. If you have been enlightened, and if your peculiarity has really been dealt with, you will be a person with a sober mind, a strong will, a pure love, and a very rich spirit. You would go along with anyone and have no opinion. You would realize what is real oneness and you would have no more dissension. You would go along with others in anything as long as it is not sinful. Why do we have the opinions? Whenever a husband and wife sit down at the dining table, opinion comes. This is because you have your peculiarity, and your spouse has her peculiarity. From this peculiarity comes the opinion. We don&rsquo;t live Christ that much because we have this antichrist&mdash;peculiarity. Christian brothers cannot be one because there is some antichrist within. Peculiarity is an enemy to Christ and also an enemy to the Body life. You cannot live Christ as long as you have your peculiarity, and you cannot have the proper Body life as long as you have your peculiarity. Bring this matter to the Lord and spend some time to pray about it. If you will do this, I believe you will see more. Many have been among us for at least ten years. But you have been stopped and stuck at this one point by the hidden antichrist of peculiarity within you.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
