   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX JOINING THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 2:19, 22; 1 Cor 12:13, 27</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The immediate question every believer asks after his conversion concerns joining a church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have covered the matter of separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This does not mean, however, that a person only needs to separate himself from the world and then can stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the positive side, he needs also to join the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The phrase joining the church is not a proper one; however, we will borrow it for our use for the time being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. THE NEED TO JOIN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Twenty or more years ago, when our testimony first began, six to eight out of ten persons who were saved had no thought of joining a church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was very strange!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They thought that it was good enough to be a Christian by themselves and that there was no need to join a church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may think this is a very strange thought, but according to our experience, quite a number of people think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They want Christ, but they do not want the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They want to have something to do with Christ, but they do not want to have anything to do with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They want to be solitary Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Can we pray by ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, they say that this is enough!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Can we read the Bible by ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, they think that this is enough!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They think that as long as one can pray and read the Bible by himself, it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They think that it is troublesome to join with others and that it is good enough as long as one believes in the Lord and fellowships with Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This concept exists in China, and it exists in other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, we must realize that whether we like it or not, we have no choice but to join the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a person is saved, he should see that there is an individual aspect as well as a corporate aspect to his Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the individual side, he has received the Lord s life, and he can fellowship with the Lord and pray by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He can lock himself up in a room and believe in the Lord by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if he only knows the individual aspect, his testimony will not be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In fact, he will not last long and will grow very little.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have never seen a reclusive Christian progress well, none in the past and none at present.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the two thousand years of church history, many people have thought that they could be believers individually.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They have thought that they could live like hermits, shutting themselves up on a mountain and caring for nothing except their fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the spiritual lessons that these ones experienced were very shallow; they could not withstand temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the environment was right, they thrived.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the environment became adverse, they could not persevere.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must realize that there is another side to the Christian life the corporate side.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Bible, as far as the corporate aspect is concerned, no one can be a solitary Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First of all, God s Word tells us that when a person is saved, he becomes a member of God s household; he becomes God s child.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once a person is born again, he is born into God s family, and he becomes God s child together with many other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second, the Bible shows us that all the saved ones are God s dwelling place, that is, God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This house is different from the household or family we spoke of earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The household refers to the family, while the house refers to the dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Third, Christians are collectively called the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are members one of another, and together we are the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A. Being Children of God</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Together with Many Others in God s Family</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After a person believes in the Lord, he receives not only an individual life but also a life that is related to many other people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As members of God s family, His dwelling place, and the Body of Christ, we are merely a part of the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is impossible for us to exist alone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we tried, we would surely miss the fullness and the riches in God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may be a useful part, but if we are not joined to others, we are like a piece of cloth cut off from the whole or a spare part of a big machine, and we cannot express the light of the fullness of the highest form of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The fullness of that light exists only in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One cannot live in a family with five brothers and sisters without being related to them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If I am the only child of my father, I do not have to deal with any brothers or sisters in the family, because I have none.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if I have five brothers and sisters in my family, I am no longer my father s only child; I am one of five children.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How can I not be related to the other brothers and sisters and remain the only son to my father?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How can I lock myself up in a room and tell the others, Do not bother me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have nothing to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am here to be my father s only son ?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How can one do that?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When a person believes in the Lord, he does not become God s only begotten son.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is one among God s millions of sons.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He cannot lock himself up and be his Father s only son.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The very nature of the life you have received does not allow this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the physical family, you may be an only child without any brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But since the day you believed in the Lord, you are bound in fellowship to the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You cannot escape from this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On that day, you were born into the biggest family in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No other family is as big as this one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You have millions and millions of brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You cannot belittle them just because there are so many of them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Because you are only one among many, there is the need for you to know them; there is the need for you to fellowship with them and to be related to them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you have no desire at all to see them, I have doubts about whether or not you are really a brother or a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you are born of God, you will be drawn towards those who are also born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you can shut yourself off from them, I have doubts about whether or not you are a child of God at all.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The concept of being an individual Christian is not a Christian concept at all.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This concept does not and should not belong to a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In our own family we should be brothers to all our brothers and sisters to all our sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>How much more should this be true in the family of God?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This relationship flows forth from the life of God and is full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is a strange thing for anyone to have no affection for his own brothers and sisters or to have no desire to communicate with them!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must remember that while we receive God s life to be His children individually, the life we obtain is also in thousands of other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I am only one among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The very nature of the life I possess does not allow me to be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It desires instead to communicate with all the other brothers and sisters.</S>
