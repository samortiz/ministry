Turn the darkness within us into light, the foolishness into clearness, so that our spirit can meet You face to face in the Holy of Holies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IT BEING DIFFICULT TO FIND A TRANSPARENT PERSON</H2><P>Two weeks ago, I had a deep feeling that among God's children it is difficult to find many who love the Lord and who are consecrated for Him. But it is more difficult to find a transparent person. No matter where a person goes, you can always find some people who love the Lord and who live for Him. But it is difficult to find one who is transparent. There is a difference between being bright and being transparent. To the Chinese, to be bright means to be good, righteous, moral, law-abiding, and just; brightness to them means cleanliness. But in the Bible, brightness does not refer to this. As far as cleanliness goes, this glass may not be as clean as this table. But as far as transparency goes, the glass is more transparent than the table. The table is hard and dark, but the glass is transparent. Although a handkerchief may be white and clean, light cannot pass through it. Transparency is there when a person lives in the light and when he becomes shining. Every person should be a shining and transparent person before God.</P><P>Revelation tells us that the four living creatures have eyes all over them. You can find people who pray every day. You can find people who are zealous for the Lord and who run around for the Lord. You can find people who have a strong interest for spiritual things. You can even find people who are willing to give up everything, but it is difficult to find one or two persons who are as clear as crystal. Among God's children, there are very few clear and transparent people. Even when many have handed over themselves, it is still difficult to find a few among them who are transparent. Some people are very proper and moral, but they are not transparent. Some people are very nice, but they are not transparent.</P><P>In my daily contact with many individuals, I have come to know all kinds of people. Among them, two are like smoking chimneys; not only are they not transparent, but they are full of foul air and smog. Clearness and transparency here refer to a person's knowledge of spiritual things and his discernment of the spiritual way. A transparent person can give others light. If we are not shining within, it means that we do not carry much weight before God. Today, there are too few transparent persons.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SALVATION BRINGING US THE LIGHT OF LIFE</H2><P>God's word says that He has transferred us from darkness into light (Acts 26:18; 1 Pet. 2:9). Formerly, we were sinful and evil. Now we do not sin any longer, and we have become proper. This is right, but this is not enough. The salvation as revealed in God's word shows us that once we were blind, but now our eyes are open. Now we are no longer in darkness but in the light. On the one hand, salvation opens our eyes. On the other hand, as the Lord Himself is the light, and salvation brings the Lord into us, it also brings light into us. The Lord said that He is the light of the world (John 8:12). Brothers and sisters, what kind of life have we received? This life is the light of men. Whether through God's salvation or through His word, we find that God's children should be transparent. Today, men think that it is normal for God's children to be dark, and when one or two of them are shining, others think that they are abnormal. Actually, to be shining is to be normal, and to be dark is to be abnormal. When we touch the life within the brothers and sisters, we touch light. When we come into the church, we also see light. When a man reads the Bible day by day, there are lights all over the Bible. With a Christian, everything and all things about him and around him are lights. It is therefore a strange thing for a Christian not to touch any light.</P><P>Where are the transparent ones today? Are you transparent? Are the ones sitting next to you transparent? I dare not say if they are.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_245.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_247.html">Next</a> </body></html>
