TO BECOME THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Son of God was transfigured to become the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). It is not easy to find the phrase <em>the Son of God</em> in the Old Testament. Although this phrase is in the Old Testament, it is not given as much emphasis as in the New Testament. For example, the Gospels speak of the Word of God, who was incarnated as a man, as the Son (John 1:1, 14). Even the Lord referred to Himself as the Son, saying, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life&rdquo; (3:36). Concerning being sent by the Father, the Son said, &ldquo;The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner&rdquo; (5:19), and &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (14:9). However, at the end of His ministry on earth, the Son said, &ldquo;If I go..., I am coming again and will receive you to Myself&rdquo; (v. 3). In this verse the word <em>coming</em> does not refer to the Lord&rsquo;s second coming at the end of this age; it refers to His coming after His resurrection from the dead. His going was to die on the cross so that He could come after His resurrection as the Spirit (vv. 16-18). He was transfigured to become the Spirit, and He came back as the Spirit. Hence, the Acts and the Epistles are altogether a story of the Spirit.</p>
<p>All that the Father is, is in the Son; and all that the Son is, is in the Spirit. The Son is the expression of the Father, and the Spirit is the realization of the Son. Where the Spirit is, there the Son is also, and all that the Son has obtained has been added to the Spirit. A person cannot receive the Lord Jesus without being moved by the Holy Spirit and allowing the Holy Spirit to work in him. We believe in the Lord Jesus, but it is the Spirit who moves within us. We have received the Lord Jesus, but we received Him when the Holy Spirit entered into us.</p>
<p>When a person repents and believes in the Lord, he does not pray to the Holy Spirit, but he feels the moving of the Holy Spirit. He is moved by the Holy Spirit, but he prays, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I receive You as my Savior.&rdquo; When a person is saved, he receives the Lord Jesus, not the Holy Spirit, as his Savior. It is amazing that when a person prays to the Lord Jesus and receives the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit enters into him. It is the Holy Spirit who touches us when we pray to the Lord Jesus. This is a mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THREE OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
BEING INSEPARABLE</h2>
<p>There are many mysterious things in the universe, but the most mysterious is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. It is not possible for our limited minds to comprehend the mystery of the Divine Trinity. How is it possible for the Son to be the Father and for the Son to become the Spirit (Isa. 9:6; 1 Cor. 15:45)? I have no way to explain these matters. But I know that when I am moved by the Spirit, I call, &ldquo;Lord Jesus!&rdquo; and when I call on the Lord, the Spirit moves in me. There is no way for us to separate the Lord Jesus from the Spirit in our experience. The Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17); hence, when we touch the Spirit, we touch the Lord Jesus, and when we draw near to the Lord Jesus, we are filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>We should not say that we do not know how to pray. At least we can call, &ldquo;O Lord, O Lord.&rdquo; There is no need to compose many sentences. We can close our eyes and say, &ldquo;Lord, Lord, O Lord.&rdquo; If we would call in this way for five minutes, we would be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This means that a person only needs to say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; and he will be in the Holy Spirit. How marvelous it is that once a person prays to the Lord Jesus, something happens within him! Someone might pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I do not believe that You exist,&rdquo; but eventually, he will be saved, because his turning to the Lord allows the Spirit to move. Hence, it is risky to pray to the Lord Jesus. Once we call on Him as the Lord, we have the Holy Spirit. I cannot explain this. Just as there are many things in the universe that scientists cannot explain, there are many spiritual matters that we cannot explain. We should not try to understand them. We simply need to know that God has put all that He is in the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and that the Lord Jesus is realized as the Holy Spirit, who is everywhere just like breath and wind. The Spirit is available for us to touch and enjoy in any place and at any time. We need only to open our mouth and call on the name of the Lord Jesus. We should try to experience Him in this way.</p>
<p>Suppose a newly saved brother, who has not been taught how to pray and who is under some pressure, calls, &ldquo;Lord, Lord.&rdquo; After a while, he will be comforted and strengthened within. Not only so, when he continues to call on the Lord, he will be enlightened. Before he called, he was confused and did not know what to do, but after calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name, he will be clear and have a way to go on because he has experienced the Lord Jesus as the Spirit being everything to him.</p>
<p>If we call on the Lord when we are depressed, in difficulty, or have a heavy burden, we will be strengthened inwardly. We will feel that someone is bearing the burden for us. The Lord not only bears our burdens; He even carries us. When we come to a dead end and are unclear concerning our future, we should call on His name to be enlightened. This is not a psychological exercise. If anyone has doubts about calling on the Lord, he should call on the name of any idol. The more he calls on an idol, the more miserable, darkened, and confused he will be. However, if he calls on the Lord a few times, he will experience the Lord being his everything.</p>
<p>Such experiences prove that God is embodied in the Lord Jesus and that the Lord Jesus is realized as the Spirit. When we call on the Lord, the Spirit touches our spirit, and we touch reality. Something that we cannot explain happens within us, and we are comforted, strengthened, and enlightened. In the past we did not understand this experience; we only knew that by calling on the Lord Jesus, we were saved from discouragement and confusion. We did not realize that we were exercising our spirit to touch the reality of comfort, strength, light, and the way.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Spirit and the Building of God &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
