   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE SIXTY-TWO CHRIST HIS ATTRIBUTES AND VIRTUES 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider further Christ's divine attributes and human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>L. MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hebrews 2:17 says, "He ought to be made like His brothers in all things, that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ became a man and lived on earth as a man, passing through all the human sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a result, He is fully qualified to be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He knows how to be merciful to man, for He is a man with the experience of human life, the experience of human suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to be qualified to be the High Priest, Christ was incarnated to be like us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may even say that He is more than like us because He suffered in His human life certain things that we have not suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He became like us, sympathizing with all our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, as the High Priest He is merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ's mercy is far-reaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His mercy goes farther than His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ's love does not reach as far as His grace, and His grace does not reach as far as His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Grace extends only to a situation that corresponds to it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But mercy goes much farther, reaching into a situation that is poor and unworthy of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to our natural condition, we are eligible only to receive the Lord's mercy, a mercy that reaches down to our pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even now, although we are saved, we are still, in some ways, in a condition that needs the Lord's mercy to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the reason Hebrews 4:16 says that first we need to obtain mercy, and then we can find grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ's mercy is always available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, we need to receive it by exercising our spirit to contact our High Priest who sympathizes with us in all our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>M. COMPASSION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Gospel of Matthew portrays Christ's compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Matthew 9:36 says, "Seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion concerning them, because they were harrassed and cast away as sheep not having a shepherd."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This verse indicates that Christ regarded the people as sheep and Himself as the Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When He came to the people, they were like lepers, paralytics, demon-possessed, and all manner of pitiful persons, because they had no shepherd to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was moved with compassion, therefore, when He saw the people in their desperate situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On another occasion, "He saw a great crowd, and He had compassion on them and healed their sick" Matt 14:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ's compassion is also displayed in the miracle of the feeding of the four thousand Matt 15:32-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 32 says, "Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with Me now three days and do not have anything they can eat; and I am not willing to send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the Lord Jesus had compassion on the multitude in the wilderness, He would not send them away fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ will not allow His followers to hunger and faint in the way while following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Compassion is somewhat different from mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although compassion is close to mercy, compassion is deeper, finer, and richer than mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mercy is somewhat outward, but compassion is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Compassion involves a deeply affectionate feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Compassion, therefore, refers to the inward feeling that resides in the one who looks upon wretchedness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is the deepest of words showing Christ's inward affection for man in his pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This affection originates in Christ's loving essence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, compassion is longer lasting than mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, compassion is both deeper and longer lasting than mercy.</S>
