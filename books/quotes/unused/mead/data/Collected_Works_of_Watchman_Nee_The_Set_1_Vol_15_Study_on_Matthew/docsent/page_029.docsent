   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 12:"Now when He heard this, He said, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's word here implies that the tax collectors and sinners knew their own position and therefore drew near to the Lord, but that the Pharisees were self-righteous and therefore blamed the Lord for being gracious toward the tax collectors and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 13:"But go and learn what this means, I desire mercy and not sacrifice,' for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The only "righteous" people in the world are the self-righteous, as were the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mercy is part of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Grace comes only from above.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, men do not like to receive grace; they prefer to give something, such as a sacrifice, to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God desires that man come just as he is to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the only ground of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To repent is to expose one's real condition, to simply admit what one is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here it shows that men many times condemn grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the Lord has dealings with sinners, the Bible says that He is separated from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, only those who are separated from sin may draw near to sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the foregoing section, in the calling of Matthew, the Lord replied to the protest of the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From 9:14 on, the Lord answered the protest of John's disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 14:"Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John somewhat practiced asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 15:"And Jesus said to them, The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the Bridegroom is with them, can they?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But days will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>" Taken away" refers to the Lord's being rejected, not to His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord's ascension was for Him to receive glory, so there was no need for the disciples to fast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, here His being taken away does not refer to His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The "Bridegroom" was the Lord, and the "sons of the bridechamber" were the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, the disciples will become the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the transitional period, the Lord considered His disciples as the sons of the bridechamber.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord was taken away from them as a result of the Jews' rejection of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 16:"No one puts a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here the "unfulled cloth," or the "new cloth," signifies the outward living, whereas the "new wine" signifies the inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A garment is exposed on the outside, and wine ferments within.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One is the living and the other is life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One is objective and the other is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The New Testament gospel gives an outward living and conduct to man as a new cloth and imparts an inward life into man as new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The regulations and ordinances of the law are like the old garment; fasting is one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To mix the new and the old is to use the gospel to help the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The best that this can do is to patch, but it can also cause a tear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, circumcision is an important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, Galatians shows us that there is no need for circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans says that man cannot be justified by the law; Galatians says that man cannot be sanctified by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as the law is unable to justify man, so it is unable to sanctify man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is precisely what the Lord teaches here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The law in the aspect of commandments is one thing, and the law in the aspect of principle is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The commandments of the law were complemented by the Lord, but the principle of the law was put aside by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Epistles, the phrase " by faith" should be rendered " by the principle of faith" for example, " The righteous shall have life and live by the principle of faith" Rom 1:17; Gal 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 17:"Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Wine here refers to the inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"New wine" means that the fermenting power has not ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The life that the Lord put in us is like the new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The old wineskins signify the ordinances of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the new wine is put into old wineskins, "the wineskins burst."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, one who has the new life cannot keep the Old Testament law of "an eye for an eye"; hence, it bursts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, putting the new life given by the Lord into the old ordinances of the law will cause them to burst.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Matthew 5 7 we see not only the fresh wineskins but also the fresh wineskins with new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The outward commandments are the highest expression of our inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Matthew 5 7 reveals what we have received within to show us that we can do the things mentioned therein.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The old wine signifies the fleshly life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"Both are preserved"; that is, both the new wine and the old wineskin are preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This means that when the law is put aside, it is preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 18:"As He was speaking these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Matthew does not tell us that the name of the ruler of the synagogue is Jairus Mark 5:22 , nor does he tell us in the previous chapter, that the name of the demon possessed man is Legion Luke 8:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Matthew seldom mentions names, because he presents the Lord as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not necessary to mention names, since they are insignificant before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The name Jairus means "the enlightening one."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Matthew says that the daughter "has just died," whereas Luke says that she "was dying."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is because Matthew records the situation after her death, and Luke narrates her condition from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Each Gospel has its own characteristic, and it records only the aspect that is related to its characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Gospel of Luke is written for the Gentiles; hence, it mentions only the things that are related to this aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the other hand, because the Gospel of Matthew is written to the Jews, it stresses the aspect of doctrine and therefore uses this event as a type of the Jews' death and their future restoration.</S>
