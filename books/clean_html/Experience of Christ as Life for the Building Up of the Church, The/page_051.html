<P>The dimensions of the tabernacle are also full of the numbers three and five. As an example of this, Exodus 27:1 speaks of the dimensions of its altar: "And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits." Again we see the numbers five and three because they are the numbers of God's building.</P><P>Now let us read Exodus 25:10 concerning the dimensions of the ark in the Holy of Holies: "And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof." Two and a half is half of five, and one and a half is half of three. The altar is five by three, and the ark is two and a half by one and a half. The altar is a complete unit, but the ark is half the size of the altar. The ark typifies Christ, and Christ has been split. The "halved" Christ is the crucified Christ for God's building. Again we see the basic numbers of five and three for God's building.</P><P>The tabernacle was of three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. According to Exodus 27:13, the width of the outer court on the east side was to be fifty cubits. Then verses 14 and 15 say that the hangings on either side of the gate were to be fifteen cubits with three pillars and three sockets. Furthermore, verse 18 says that the height of the linen curtains of the outer court was to be five cubits. Actually, each curtain of the enclosure in the outer court measured five cubits by five cubits.</P><P>The above illustrations should prove to us that the numbers three and five are the numbers for God's building. This also shows us that the compound ointment is for God's building. God charged Moses to anoint the tabernacle and all the utensils of the tabernacle with this ointment (Exo. 30:26-29). Moses also was to anoint Aaron and his sons with the compound ointment (v. 30). This means that the all-inclusive Spirit is also for God's priesthood. If the tabernacle with everything related to it had not been anointed with the ointment, it would have been a secular building, not a holy building, not God's building. The tabernacle could never have been a divine building until every part of it was anointed with the holy compound ointment.</P>
