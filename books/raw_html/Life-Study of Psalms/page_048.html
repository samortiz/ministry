<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Nations Having Sunk<br>in the Pit That They Made</H2><P>David said that the nations have sunk in the pit that they made; their own foot is caught in the net that they hid; the wicked have been snared in their own work; and all the nations who forget God will be turned back to Sheol (Psa. 9:15-17). It seems these ones were in Sheol, Hades, already. Now David prayed that God would send them back and not let them out of Sheol. What kind of prayer is this? Is this the New Testament? This is again David's "testament."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Needy Not Always Being Forgotten</H2><P>David also said that the needy will not always be forgotten by God, nor will the hope of the afflicted perish forever (Psa. 9:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. David Asking God to Look on His Affliction<br>and Not Let Mortal Man Prevail</H2><P>David asked God to look on his affliction and not let mortal man prevail, but let the nations know that they are mortal (Psa. 9:13a, 19, 20b). It was as if David said, "God, You have to tell the nations that they are mortal men. Since they are mortal, they cannot prevail against me because I am under Your care; so look on my affliction." But what about David's sins? His wife at that time was actually the wife of the one whom he murdered. One thousand years later, when Matthew wrote the genealogy of Christ, he said, "David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah" (1:6). David, a man after the heart of God (1 Sam. 13:14; Acts 13:22), did right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of his life except for this one evil (1 Kings 15:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. CONCERNING MAN'S CONDITION BEFORE GOD</H2><P>Psalms 10&#151;14 show us David's concept concerning man's condition before God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. David Challenging God</H2><P>David challenged God, saying, "Why, O Jehovah, do You stand far off?/Why do You hide Yourself in times of distress?" (10:1). David prayed, but God did not answer absolutely according to what he prayed, so that bothered him. It was as if David asked God, "Why do You hide Yourself when I need You in times of distress? It seems that the more I cry out to You, the more You disappear."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Wicked Man's Sin against People<br>and Arrogance toward God</H2><P>In Psalm 10:2-11 David describes the wicked man's sin against people and arrogance toward God. The wicked man thinks there is no God, so he can do whatever he likes (v. 4). Verses 2-11 describe the condition of man. Actually, David is accusing all of mankind in these verses.</P>
