   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEEP EXPERIENCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Writing to the Corinthians, Paul said, "To boast is necessary, though indeed not expedient" 2 Cor 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He admitted that it was "not profitable" Gk. for himself to write what he wrote in 2 Corinthians 12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But for the sake of others he had to do it; he was obliged to speak of "visions and revelations of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brothers and sisters, this should be our attitude also.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many of us cannot stand the test of visions and revelations; as soon as we have a little experience, we blow the trumpet, and everyone knows about it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul knew that it was of no profit to himself to mention the Lord's visions and revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why then did he mention them?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was forced to do so because some doubted his apostleship, and there were problems concerning the foundation of the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Did Paul disclose all his revelations?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Far from it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He wrote, "I know a man who is himself in Christ, fourteen years ago whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know; God knows such a one was caught away to the third heaven" v. 2 . He did not divulge this experience until fourteen years later.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What depth there was in Paul!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It would be a wonder if we could hide away something we received from God for seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But for fourteen years Paul never divulged his experience; for fourteen years God's church knew nothing of it; for fourteen years not one of the apostles had heard of it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul's roots were deep beneath the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some people would be inclined to say, "Paul, let us hear all about that experience of yours fourteen years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Tell us about your experience in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It would be most helpful for us to know the whole story."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But he said, "I know such a man whether in the body or outside the body, I do not know; God knows , that he was caught away into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not allowed for a man to speak" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To this present day this experience of Paul's has not been uprooted; still no one knows about that experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, this matter of root is a matter of extreme importance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you want to have Paul's work, then you need to have Paul's "root"; if you want to have Paul's outward conduct, then you need to have Paul's inner life; if you want to have Paul's manifest power, then you need to have Paul's secret experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The trouble with Christians today is that they cannot keep any spiritual thing or any special experience undisclosed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As soon as they have a little experience, they have to tell it abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They live their lives before men; nothing is hidden within them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They do not have any root.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May God show us Paul's experience, and may He lead us into having depth!</S>
