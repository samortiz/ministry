Eventually, at the end of the Bible, there is a city built with the divine Trinity mingled with His redeemed people
Between God's creation at the beginning and the new city at the end, the divine revelation advances progressively book after book
By the time we reach Leviticus, many of the fallen people have been saved and have become God's redeemed people
The army is for God's people to fight so that God can gain the ground on earth to build up His kingdom with His habitation
In Numbers we can see three things: the formation of an army, the journeys of that army, and the fighting of the army
The formation of the army was for fighting, and the fighting required the army to journey, not to stay in one spot
In a general way, we may say that the central thought of the entire Bible is Christ, for the Bible is focused on Christ as the center
Since the ark typifies Christ, the meaning of the Israelites' life was to take care of Christ as the testimony of God
In keeping with this principle, the law of God is a testimony of what God is; it tells us what kind of God our God is
For Christ to be the embodiment of God means that He is the portrait of God, and as such He is the testimony of what God is
The four camps each composed of three tribes and the three families of the tribe of Levi all took the tabernacle with the ark as the center
Worldly people have neither a way nor a goal, but we have Christ not only as our Leader but also as our way and our goal
In the New Testament there is a revelation of Christ in all these aspects, but it is not given there in detail
If we had only the New Testament and not the Old Testament with all its types, we could not see Christ in such a detailed and fine portrait
The fulfillment of God's intention to gain a people and to have them formed into an army was not a simple matter
In Numbers we see that one race, the race of Israel, was saved, sanctified, and formed and arranged into an army
The picture of the New Jerusalem in Numbers 1 involves the encampment of the twelve tribes of Israel around the tabernacle
The New Jerusalem has twelve gates, three gates on each of the four sides, with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on them
In this array, three tribes, each tribe being an army, were encamped on each of the four sides of the tabernacle
On the east, toward the sunrise, was the camp of Judah, composed of the armies of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun
Now we can realize how Numbers 1 affords us a picture of the New Testament from the incarnation to the New Jerusalem
Now this wonderful One, the Triune God incarnated to be embodied as a man, has been expanded, increased, and enlarged
Now, in His expansion into a tabernacle, Christ is not only God's dwelling place but also the place where we can enter into God
Christ, the embodiment of God, has been enlarged into a habitation in which God dwells and into which we enter
Eventually, the picture in Numbers shows us God and His chosen people mingled together as one entity to conquer the enemy on earth
He had to be incarnated to become a man, Christ, and this Christ has to be ministered to sinners to make them all the enlargement of Christ
As a result, there is on earth the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man that God may move on earth and regain it
The children of Israel were formed into a body to fight for God as warriors and serve God as priests for the carrying out of God's purpose
God in Himself needs no protection, but God in His embodiment needs to be protected by the fighting of the church
The children of Israel were formed into a fighting army by being numbered by their families and leaders and according to their age
The children of Israel were numbered by the families and their leaders, that is, by the source of life and under its leadership
As believers in Christ, we all have three kinds of fathers: a fleshly father, a spiritual father, and the divine Father
The females signify those who are spiritually weaker, and the males under twenty signify those who are spiritually immature
The sisters in the church life today should not feel excluded by this, because spiritually speaking they may be men, the stronger ones
For a vow to God, an Israelite male of the highest valuation was required to be between twenty years old and sixty years old
If we say that there is no leadership in the church we annul put aside the elders who are the real and actual leadership in the church life
The fighting Israelites were the outward protection for the serving Levites, who were for the testimony of God
The Levites were encamped around the tabernacle, and they were surrounded by the twelve tribes, who protected them
Ephesians, a book on the church, reveals that the church is a corporate warrior fighting the battle for God's testimony
The children of Israel encamping in array typifies God's redeemed people being consummated in the New Jerusalem
In the Catholic church, the state churches, the denominations, and the independent groups, there is much confusion
Among the real ones, there are many tares, many false believers, as revealed in the parable in Matthew 13:24-30, 36-43
Of course, God's formed army does not include the tares; only the genuine believers in Christ throughout the generations are counted
All these believers, after being saved, sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of Christ, will be glorified
God in His economy does not care for these but for the wheat which will be transformed in nature to become gold pearls and precious stones
In the New Jerusalem we will not see tares, leaven, or the big tree; instead, we will see gold, pearls, and precious stones
We may have the joyous assurance that we also have gold, pearls, and precious stones and that these are growing and increasing
When we look at our church and our work, we may be grieved by the damage caused by the messy situation among us
They should not cast the church aside but should go on until they get out of Matthew 13 and reach the New Jerusalem
We will reach the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom, which will still be in the old creation but will be in a revived dispensation
If an Israelite were born in the house of Reuben, he had to camp with the tribe of Reuben and be under the ensign of Reuben
We today need to learn not to have our own preferences but to be according to God's ordination and arrangement
All the children of Israel were encamped 'facing the tent of meeting' , with the testimony of God as their unique center and goal
The ark within the tabernacle was the testimony of God, and the testimony of God was the law contained within the ark
On the south side was the standard of the camp of Reuben, composed of the armies of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad; these were to set out second
On the west side was the standard of the camp of Ephraim composed of the armies of Ephraim Manasseh and Benjamin these were to set out third
On the north side was the standard of the camp of Dan, composed of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali; these were to set out last
Dan was also the worst, for he was a 'serpent' , and he was the first to rebel against God's kingdom and set up a second worship center
In the midst of the camps was the tent of meeting, with the camp of the Levites, which was to set out in the middle of the four camps
Levi begot three sons, who occupied three sides of the tabernacle, leaving one side for Moses, Aaron, and Aaron's sons
Although there are many pictures in the Old Testament, few Christians know how to apply them to what is recorded in the New Testament
If we read Revelation 21 and 22 carefully, we will find in these chapters certain reminders referring us to the Old Testament
We need to look into these matters in Numbers, not for others but for ourselves, considering our situation today
In order to read the book of Numbers properly, we need to humble ourselves before the Lord and allow Him to open His word
In this message we will begin to consider the holy service, which is covered in chapters three and four of Numbers
The tabernacle is the tent, and the altar, located in the outer court, is where the sacrifices were offered to God
To minister is to serve, and to serve is to supply people by ministering to them, just as a waiter supplies people with food
Today we, the New Testament believers, serve others with the cross of Christ for redemption and the riches of Christ for the life supply
The priesthood is an organism, and it can be properly practiced only in the organic Body of Christ, not in organized Christianity
An organization can go on even when there is much trouble, but the Body of Christ is bothered when only a little trouble is present
Those to encamp before the tabernacle on the east, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, were Moses and Aaron and his sons'
For the priests to keep the charge of the sanctuary meant that they were responsible for the entire sanctuary and everything related to it
We not only bear the charge of the sanctuary ourselves, but often we must bear the responsibility for others' service
For this reason, the number of Levites had to equal the number of firstborn, and any shortage had to be redeemed
They shall keep his charge and the charge of the whole assembly before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle'
The Gershonites the descendants of Gershon camped behind the tabernacle on the west and were in charge of the tabernacle with all its parts
God gave Jacob twelve sons so that there could be twelve tribes encamped around the tabernacle, with three on each of the four sides
As we consider this we realize that only God could write the book of Numbers and only God could provide the materials to have such an array
Six signifies the man created on the sixth day, and eight signifies the resurrected Christ, the Christ who was resurrected on the eighth day
From the foregoing we can realize that not everyone is able to bring the Lord's recovery from one country to another
The priests packed the furnishings of the sanctuary, including the ark, the showbread table, the lampstand, the golden altar, and the altar
The Levites doing their service were not according to their way but under the direction of the anointed priests
After Christ was glorified the Spirit became the allinclusive compound lifegiving indwelling Spirit who is the consummated Triune God
To be counted in the service to God, one had to be one month old and above those at that age needed to grow and mature
The priests took care of the primary things, the most important things, and the Kohathites took care of some of the secondary things
If the arranging of chairs is done in this way, the serving ones will pray for the church and for those who will sit on the chairs
Any kind of outward activity must be carried out under the supervision of the inward, spiritual view of the priesthood
All the service in the church business office should be done under the heavenly view and supervision of the priests
Whatever we do in the church business office will become a spiritual activity and will minister life to others
The first illustration of this was the case of Miriam and Aaron, who rebelled against God's deputy authority, Moses
The third thing that must be dealt with is the uncleanness through contact with the dead the spiritual deadness
Leprosy, discharges, and spiritual deadness cannot be allowed to remain in God's dwelling place, army, and priesthood
The three kinds of defilement dealt with in the camp of Israel constitute all the uncleanness that needs to be dealt with in the church
After confessing our sins to God , we should go to the one we have wronged to make restitution in full for our trespass
Numbers 57c says that the person who committed the trespass should add onefifth to the trespass giving it to him to whom he did the trespass
Because we Christians are still in the old man we do not realize in how many things we desire to make a gain for ourselves at others expense
The individual dealing described in these verses may seem like a small matter, but it is like a small screw in a big machine
The Lord answered Elijah, saying, 'I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal'
In understanding the book of Numbers, we can easily understand in a logical way the corporate and individual dealings in 5:1-10
It is not easy to comprehend logically the dealing in 5:11-31, something that is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible
The books from Exodus to Malachi are a long history of the children of Israel, unveiling to us an abundance of divine truth
Proverbs 4:18 says, 'The path of the righteous is as the dawning light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day'
From this illustration we see that a clear, plain word may include a figure of speech which may be regarded as a part of typology
What is portrayed here has nothing to do with history or with a character, but it does have something to do with typology
On the side of the individual, the dealing with one's faithfulness is a dealing according to God's righteousness
Numbers 5:11-31 is a particular portion in all the sixty-six books of the Bible, showing us not only God's sovereignty but also His miracle
The test with the water of bitterness used a combination of water , dust from the floor of the tabernacle , and the meal offering
If she was sinful, the water would work in her abdomen to cause it to swell and to cause her thigh to be reduced
He healed a blind man by mingling spittle with dust to make clay and then anointing the blind man's eyes with the clay
Today, if the Lord tried to do this to us, we might consider it a joke, and we might not be willing to allow Him to do such a thing to us
The water typifies the Holy Spirit, the meal offering of barley typifies the resurrected Christ, and the dust represents the created man
We see the human nature created by God conjoined with Gods dwelling place put into the Holy Spirit and applied with the resurrected Christ
We may not have leprosy, we may not have discharges, and we may not have any contact with deadness, but are we chaste?
Let us now briefly consider some of the details related to the dealing with a wife over whom her husband was jealous
The dealing with a wife over whom her husband was jealous typifies Christ's jealousy over His believers and His church
The dealings in the book of Numbers show that the requirement for God's people to be formed into an army is very high
If the church or any of the believers seeks and pursues anything other than Christ, that is spiritual adultery in the eyes of God
Those who commit spiritual fornication will be judged and cursed by God and will not be able to fight for God and serve God
Barley signifies the resurrected Christ, oil signifies the Holy Spirit, and frankincense signifies resurrection
The priest shall take a handful of the meal offering, as its memorial portion, and offer it up in smoke upon the altar'
The section on dealing with defilement shows us that God wants His people to be clean, righteous, and faithful
Although she loves you and is altogether chaste toward you, she may not be utterly, absolutely, and ultimately for you
Numbers 6:2 speaks of a man or a woman making 'a special vow, the vow of a Nazarite, to separate himself to Jehovah'
At times we might have made a vow to the Lord, but it might not have been very strong or absolute, and we might not have kept it
One's becoming a priest is a matter of God's initiation; it does not depend on what the person does but on what God does concerning him
The priests are ordained by God out of His initiation, but the Nazarites become such by a vow out of their own initiation
Samuel, out of his own initiation, came in to fill up the gap caused by Eli's deficiencies and thereby to complement the deficient Eli
All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made from the grapevine, not even the seeds or the skins'
A Nazarite had to abstain from vinegar made from wine, from the juice of grapes, and from grapes fresh or dried
From this we see that the one who is absolute for God is altogether separated from anything of earthly pleasures
Until the completion of the days for which he separated himself to Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall let the hair of his head grow freely'
The Nazarite was to let his hair grow long ; that is, he was to remain in subjection to the Lord's headship, wherein is the power
We must not shave our head; that is, we must respect authority and remain under the headship of our Lord in every way
In this message we will continue to consider the matter of being sanctified to be a Nazarite covered in chapter six of Numbers
A Nazarite must remain fully sanctified, separated to God from all things, and should continually cleave to God
A Nazarite had to abstain from earthly pleasure and not be defiled by the deadness that comes through natural affection
Today we are living among others, and we cannot predict when, spiritually speaking, someone will die beside us
In the church life, sin may come in to defile the church and damage the saints, but more often we are defiled by death
Often death is right beside us, yet we have no consciousness of it or feeling concerning it and become defiled by it
You did not know it, but in that particular meeting you received some killing; you were deadened by some kind of death
It is easy to abstain from earthly pleasure, but it is not easy to sense that we are near someone who is spiritually dead
If we are living in the Spirit in every way, when we come to a meeting, we may immediately have the sense that deadness is there
We may realize not only that the meeting is low and slow but that in the meeting there is deadness hidden beneath the surface
It is not easy, however, to avoid the unexpected death of someone near us, because that kind of death is often hidden
With the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, there is evil; however, the result of partaking of this tree is not evil it is death
As Nazarites we must abstain from earthly pleasure, remain under the headship of the Lord, and learn to fight against death
Because these germs are even in the church life, we need to pray daily, hourly, fighting against death, the last enemy of God
If we keep ourselves from the defilement of death we will be living persons who can be absolute for God for His army and for His priesthood
Not only the house of Aaron had the privilege of being absolute for God; this opportunity was available to all
God's regulation balanced His ordination and gave equal opportunity to all God's people to be absolute for God as a warrior or as a priest
In order to be a Nazarite, one must pass through all the dealings with defilement and the test of suspicion in chapter five
He must overcome the natural affection toward his blood relatives, the natural affection he has for his mother, father, wife, and children
The Lord Jesus recognized as His relatives those who were His relatives in spirit, not those who were His relatives in the natural life
In family life we surely need to respect the differences between the grandparents, the parents, and the children
Although, in the spirit, the older ones should also learn to obey the younger ones , still the difference in age remains
Today some are teaching that it is not necessary for believers to submit to a deputy authority, that believers should not be under anyone
It is damaging to those who teach in this way, and then it is damaging to the ones who receive such a teaching
Those who accept the teaching that the believers should not submit to deputy authority will be spoiled by this teaching
It is a serious matter to teach that we should not submit to deputy authority, and it is also a serious matter to receive this teaching
There is no excuse for being defiled by death, and the sudden death of someone will cause your Nazarite vow to be made void
Otherwise, you will be killed, and eventually the entire church, seemingly without explanation, will be brought into a deadened situation
The enjoyment of Christ as these offerings indicates the overcoming of natural affection, earthly pleasure, rebellion, and death
male' signifies strong, 'lamb' signifies meek, 'a year old' signifies fresh, and 'without blemish' signifies without defects
The reason we need Gods redemption which has been completed in Christ is that no matter how good we may be we are still in the old creation
While we are offering ourselves to God to live absolutely, utterly, and ultimately for Him, we realize that we are still sinful
We and God enjoy Christ as the burnt offering and as the sin offering, and this issues in the enjoyment of Christ as the peace offering
We need to stay in and muse upon the revelation of Christ in these types in the book of Numbers so that we may enjoy Him more
The second status is that of a male, representing God and having his head shaved as a sign of his being God's representative
On the one hand, we are those who offer Christ; on the other hand, we are those who carry out the priestly service
We must be up to the level of a Nazarite, one who overcomes natural affection, earthly pleasure, rebellion, and unexpected death
If we overcome these four things and stay away from them, we will be in a position to receive God Himself as our blessing
Although God desires to bless His chosen people in this way, they need to come up to a standard that matches His blessing
The entire universe was created by God, yet without God, apart from God, even the universe created by God is vanity
The existence of the universe is a great miracle, but without God the miraculous existence of the universe is vanity
Ephesians chapter one gives us a record of how the Triune God blesses His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people in His divine trinity
The church as the Body of Christ is the total issue of the divine Trinity as a flow to dispense all that God is into His chosen people
The New Jerusalem has twelve gates with the names of the twelve tribes , and twelve foundations with the names of the twelve apostles
The consummation of the record of the entire Bible is God the triune as the very particular and subjective blessing to His people
The Father blesses us in every way and in every aspect in His love , and He keeps us in every way and in every aspect in His power
We should pray for the blessing of being kept absolutely in the dispensing Triune God and altogether outside of the evil one
In Luke 1:78, when the Lord Jesus was about to be born, Zachariah prophesied, 'The rising sun from on high shall visit us'
Wherever He went, He was a great light shining upon the people sitting in darkness , for He is the light of the world
Numbers 6:25 speaks not only of Jehovah making His face to shine upon us, but also of Jehovah being gracious to us
In the blessing in Numbers 6 we have both the face and the countenance, and there is a difference between them
To lift up your countenance upon a person means that you confirm, assure, promise, and give everything to that person
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
It may seem to us that everything under the sun and even everything in the spiritual field is vanity of vanities
God liked Abraham very much as a close friend but He could only come to visit him to stay in His friends tent for a few hours and then leave
When the children of Israel went down into Egypt, they were usurped, occupied, by Pharaoh, who used them as slaves
At this stage in the book of Numbers, God was no longer just in the heavens; He was the very God of the heavens and of the earth
The tabernacle with all its furnishings fully portrays and typifies the embodied Triune God, the processed Triune God
The Christian life is a touring life; it is a life of daily taking a tour in the tabernacle, the typified Triune God
As we are taking such a tour, we will see the showbread, the lampstand, and the incense altar, all of which typify Christ
The ointment with which the anointing is accomplished may be likened to paint, and the anointing may be likened to painting
From that time onward, the tabernacle and the altar were absolutely one with the compounded, consummated Triune God
After the tabernacle and the altar were anointed, they became most holy, and whoever touched them was sanctified, made holy
By being anointed, by being identified with the processed Triune God, the tabernacle and the altar were dedicated
My point here is that, according to God's New Testament economy, God will not move, act, or do anything by Himself
The leaders of the twelve tribes offered twelve silver plates, twelve silver basins, and twelve gold spoons full of incense
Although the pace was slow, both the offering people and the offering time were eternally complete and perfect for the divine administration
The result of the sin offering and the burnt offering is the peace offering, signifying our enjoyment with God and God's enjoyment with us
The issue of the sin offering and the burnt offering is the rich peace offering, through which we and God enjoy Christ mutually in peace
First you should offer yourself to cooperate with God and then offer Christ as your sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offering
When we have the proper worship of God, God is satisfied by the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and peace offerings
In this message on chapter eight of Numbers, we will briefly consider two matters lighting the lamps and the presenting of the Levites
Every day, early in the morning, we are cleansed anew through the sprinkling, the applying, of the redeeming blood of Christ
The meal offering of fine flour mingled with oil indicates that they should live as Christ lived in His humanity
The services of the tabernacle should have been taken care of by the sons of Israel, yet God chose the Levites to replace the sons of Israel
Now these Levites were about to be presented to God, meaning that all the sons of Israel would be presented to God
Aaron shall offer the Levites before Jehovah as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, that they may do the service of Jehovah'
Three parties were identified with one another through the laying on of hands: the sons of Israel, the Levites, and the bulls
Moses offered one bull for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to make propitiation for the Levites
On the one hand, Aaron could offer them to God, yet, on the other hand, Moses had to make propitiation for them
You shall present the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and shall offer them as a wave offering to Jehovah'
Through the foregoing procedure, Moses separated the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites became God's
The Levites went in to do the service of the tent of meeting instead of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel
If the Levites had not carried out this service, the firstborn of the sons of Israel would have been required to do it
What they had gained in experience through the twenty-five years of their service was still needed after the age of fifty
There were many different charges concerning the service of the tabernacle with all its contents, the altar, and the outer court
We all, especially the young ones, need to learn the spiritual regulations and spiritual laws regarding the service of God
Numbers 5:1 through 9:14 is a section which may be considered an insertion in the record about the formation of the army
By the time of Numbers 7, the tabernacle and the altar had been built up by God through His people and belonged to God
Approximately two years ago, a certain denominational journal recognized that this one who came to Abraham was Jesus
He asked them if they had anything to eat, and when they handed Him part of a broiled fish, 'He took it and ate before them'
The completed, or consummated, God is symbolized by the ointment, which was compounded with four spices and olive oil
We may say that in Exodus 30 we have the 'cream,' the ointment, and in 1 John 2 we have the moving of the cream, the anointing
When Jesus was glorified, that is, when He entered into resurrection , the Triune God was consummated and completed to become the Spirit
In the Old Testament there are many different kinds of offerings, but today we have one, all-inclusive offering the all-inclusive Christ
The offering of ourselves to God is God's second provision, and the all-inclusive Christ is the third divine provision
As those who are being anointed by God and who offer themselves to Him, we need to lay our hands upon Christ as our sin offering
After enjoying Christ as our sin offering and burnt offering, we no longer have condemnation, rebuking, or conviction
Along with the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering, we have a basket of bread, cakes, wafers, and the drink offering
The hair, which signifies the natural strength, must be shaved off , indicating that our natural strength must be cut off
No matter how busy God's people were and no matter where they were, they were required to participate in the Passover once a year
They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it; according to all the statute for the passover they shall keep it'
To eat the Passover with bitter herbs means that we need to regret and repent, to experience a bitter taste regarding sinful things
We should not think that partaking of the Lord's table has nothing to do with God's move or with our move with God in His activity
We have been replaced by Christ, we belong to Him, and we should enjoy Him by taking Him as our life, our life supply, and our everything
Every week, on the first day of the week, we should have the remembrance of the Lord at His table, enjoying all that He is to us
Whenever we participate in the Passover or in the Lord's table, we partake of a feast to enjoy Christ in the presence of God
Now they were ready to move on, to journey to fight for God that He might gain the ground on earth to build up His kingdom with His house
Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
The history of human civilization shows that man has usually 'followed the cloud' and settled where there is water
When the cloud moved, that was a sign that God was ready to move and that the people should also get ready to move
Because the children of Israel followed the cloud, they did not need to worry or be anxious about when to move
The children of Israel followed the cloud in order to keep the charge of God according to the word of God by Moses
In the wilderness, the children of Israel numbered more than two million, but they were in good order and were under a divine arrangement
When both are blown, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting'
But if they blow only one, then the leaders, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall assemble themselves to you'
In Numbers the sound of the trumpet was called an alarm because, in God's thought, the children of Israel were continually at war
Concerning certain moves, we suffered a great deal because we did not have the consciousness that we were in a battle
Only the sons of Aaron, the most spiritual persons, those closest to God, those who knew His heart and intention, could blow the trumpets
The sons of Israel were to sound an alarm with the trumpets when they went to war in their own land against their adversary
To sound an alarm with the trumpet is a marvelous thing because this causes us to be remembered by God and to be saved from our enemies
On these occasions the sons of Israel were to blow the trumpets over their burnt offerings and their peace offerings
Of the five basic offerings, the burnt offering and the peace offering are great enjoyments to God and to His people
In the same principle when we and God live in peace remain in peace and enjoy peace as a mutual fellowship there will also be a great day
In this sequence, the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah took the lead , setting out first by their armies
They were followed, not by another camp, but by the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, the Levites who carried the tabernacle
The Kohathites, the Levites who carried the sanctuary, set out next, and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival
The camp of the sons of Ephraim set out third , and the camp of the sons of Dan, taking up the rear of all the camps, set out last
Verses 29 through 32 give us a record of Moses asking his father-in-law, an older and more experienced Midianite, to go with them
Moses besought him to go with them in order that he might be their eyes, for they were to encamp in the wilderness
Moses thought that his father-in-law would be a great help, but God's sovereignty would not allow any man to come in
The remaining verses in chapter ten reveal the leading of the ark the crucified and resurrected Christ in His resurrection
The Kohathites should have set out after the camp of Reuben; nevertheless, the ark came to the front to take the lead
The term guidance is used with respect to the cloud and the blowing of the trumpets, but concerning the ark we have used the term leading
During the forty years the children of Israel traveled in the wilderness, it was difficult to find a resting place for two million people
As the ark, He was their Leader, taking the lead to find a resting place for them and to lead them through the hard part of their journey
Numbers 10:34 tells us that the cloud of Jehovah was over the children of Israel by day when they set out from the camp
When the ark set out, Moses said, 'Arise, O Jehovah, and let Your enemies be scattered; and let them that hate You flee before You'
It is not likely that, when he uttered this word, Moses was clear that the ark was a type of the incarnated Jehovah
In order to understand such a word, we need the whole Bible, because sometimes the speaking of the prophets was fulfilled much later
If the arising in verse 35 refers to Christ's ascension, then the return in verse 36 must refer to His second coming
Moses' understanding might have been that when the ark set out, the God who was somewhat embodied in the ark rose up
The application of Numbers 1035 in Psalm 68 and Ephesians 4 indicates that Moses word in Numbers 1036 must refer to Christs second coming
Concerning Moses' word in Numbers 10, there was an application at Moses' time, and there is also an application in God's economical plan
In this message we will begin to consider the failures recorded in chapters eleven through fourteen of Numbers
After this marvelous word at the end of chapter ten, from chapter eleven through chapter seventeen there is nearly nothing except failure
The insult was so severe that Jehovah, who is full of mercy and patience, could not tolerate the situation any longer and became very angry
We remember the fish we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic'
Verse 6 goes on to say, 'Now our soul is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna before our eyes'
Even though the children of Israel witnessed this miracle daily for forty years, they were not affected by it in a positive way
Bdellium has been interpreted to signify two different substances, both a white transparent gum and a white pearl
The people went about and gathered it, and ground it between millstones or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it'
Whenever we touch Christ as our life supply, we have the sense that heaven has come to us in a soft, watering, refreshing manner
In spite of such a wonderful miracle every day, they grew bored of this manna and longed for the food of Egypt
According to verses 10 through 15, Moses went to God and complained that the people were a heavy burden upon him
God's raising up these seventy elders indicates that when He does something, He does it completely and in full
Joshua the son of Nun, a minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them'
Moses uttered a great prophecy: 'Oh, that all Jehovah's people were prophets, that Jehovah would put His Spirit upon them'!
He brought in so many quail that they surrounded the camp for a distance equal to a day's journey and to a depth of about three feet
Therefore the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted'
Those on the extremities of the camp of Israel murmured evil against Moses and against God, and then the mixed multitude lusted for meat
She had been ordained by God, and when the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, she took the lead in praising God
There were 'germs' hidden within Miriam and Aaron that were stirred up by the 'winds' blowing with the tide of turmoil
From this we need to learn that in the service of the Lord we should not allow anything negative to remain hidden within us
Being older than Moses in their heart they regarded themselves higher than Moses and were jealous of the greater respect that Moses received
Throughout the generations, the germs of jealousy and rivalry regarding speaking for the Lord have existed among God's servants
Although Moses was younger than Miriam and Aaron, God had appointed him to be His deputy authority, His representative authority
God had called Aaron and had raised up Miriam, but there is no hint that God charged them to be His representative
In God's lexicon, in the spiritual dictionary, to be meek is not to strive, not to fight back, when others are against you
Jehovah came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the entrance of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward'
We may think that the male had borne more responsibility and that he should have been punished instead of the female
God punished Miriam to warn and alarm all the females among the children of Israel so that they would not follow Miriam
At that time the atmosphere and morale among the children of Israel had been severely damaged by their rebellious situation
Also, the spies were to bring some fruit of the land, for the time was the season of the first fruits of the grapes
Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, 'Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well able to prevail'
All the assembly of Israel cried aloud wept and murmured against Moses and Aaron saying to them If only we had died in the land of Egypt!
If Jehovah delights in us, He will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which flows with milk and honey
The entire Bible presents one matter that God desires to be embodied in one person, who is the unique One in the universe
God and man are in this person; He includes all the elements and attributes of the divine nature and all the virtues of the human nature
We thank the Lord for opening His holy Word to us, enabling us to see aspects of Christ which have been veiled for centuries
Very soon after the first century, the Bible, the revelation of this wonderful person, became veiled and later was locked up by Catholicism
What they teach, preach, and propagate is largely according to human thought, with only a little that is according to the divine thought
During the past sixty years, the Lord has opened His Word to us and has shown us many items that had been veiled for centuries
When we receive the Spirit, we receive an all-inclusive person who is the consummation of the processed Triune God
During the past sixty years, the Lord has brought us on and on, and a number of advancements have taken place among us
The main item of the biblical theology is God's economy, which is altogether centered in the all-inclusive Christ
We have experienced Him as the Passover, the manna, the rock, the living water, the law portraying God, the offerings, and the tabernacle
In this message we will first continue to consider the failure of the children of Israel in not believing in God
Hundreds of years before, God had told their forefather Abraham that He would give the land of Canaan to his descendants
It was because of this mixing of the human race with the fallen angels that God destroyed the whole human race by the flood
Later, the same mixed race, the Nephilim, a mixture of fallen angels and fallen man, dwelt in the land of Canaan
If we care only for our existence, security, safety, peace, and future, we may become an abhorrence in the eyes of God
If they had thought even a little about God's interests, they would have said, 'God, as You have been so good to us, we just love You
We would like to sacrifice our future, our safety, our security, our existence, and everything for Your purpose
The worldly people are concerned daily for their own security and benefit, but we should care for God and His interests
In His abhorring of the people of Israel, God wanted to strike them with a pestilence and make of Moses a nation greater than they
God forgave the people according to Moses' prayer , but their unbelief nevertheless had certain negative consequences
The people had said that their little ones would become a prey and would be taken over by the Canaanites and the Nephilim
The men who returned with an evil report and made all the assembly murmur against Moses died by the plague before Jehovah
The Amalekites and the Canaanites who dwelt in that mountain came down, and defeated them and beat them back as far as Hormah'
In Canaan there were at least seven tribes, but only these two tribes came out to fight against the people of Israel
The Canaanites signify human beings who have joined themselves to the evil spirits, to the satanic power of darkness in the air
We should not think that it is a small thing to touch the church, the church life, the way of the church, or the ground of the church
Our own history of the past twenty-seven years tells us that it is not a small thing to touch God's way, which is the church
According to the behavior of the children of Israel, it became clear that they did not care very much for God's interests
It is doubtful that at that time the children of Israel remembered all the instructions on how to be accepted by God
In the Old Testament typology, this Christ, our replacing One, has many aspects, which can be seen in the many different kinds of offerings
Probably they had forgotten to offer the offerings required by God to make propitiation for their errors, wrongdoings, and rebellion
After that, as a great surprise to Moses, his older sister and brother, who had always been with him at the center of God's move, rebelled
The situation and atmosphere among the children of Israel were very low, and the morale, along with all the positive things, was gone
We offer Christ to God because we are unable to make God happy, to be well-pleasing to Him, and to be accepted by Him
By offering Christ to God we admit that, in ourselves and by ourselves, we cannot please Him or be acceptable to Him
If we try in ourselves to do something to please God, our effort is a blasphemy to God because it is a denial of what God has done for us
We should also keep in mind that striving in ourselves and for ourselves means nothing and is actually blasphemy
According to the instructions given in Exodus and Leviticus, God commanded that at the appointed feasts more offerings be offered to Him
Whenever we offer a burnt offering or a peace offering, we need to match this offering with a meal offering of fine flour mingled with oil
Such a meal offering signifies Christ in His humanity mingled with the Holy Spirit to be the food of God and man
The same statute and ordinance were for all the people of Israel and the sojourning strangers and the heathen among the people of Israel
When we offer Him as the heave offering, we offer something with the heavenly element, atmosphere, essence, and taste
The Christ whom we offer in His ascension to God as God's food is the Christ who is the firstfruit in resurrection
For the sin of ignorance, the assembly of Israel was to 'offer one young bull for a burnt offering, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah'
God's forgiveness is based on Christ's redemption for propitiation, without which God has no ground to forgive man
If we, taking Christ's redemptive death as our standing, ask God to forgive us, He must do it based on His righteousness, not on His mercy
Certain ones acted as if they were the only ones who mattered; they ignored, neglected, despised, and abandoned everyone else
Because of the turmoil among the children of Israel, God was, in a sense, forced to insert the ordinances recorded in chapter fifteen
God spoke to Moses concerning this saying The man shall surely be put to death all the assembly shall stone him with stones outside the camp
We may think that gathering wood on the Sabbath was not a serious offense and that the punishment meted out was too severe
To break the Sabbath is not merely to do something wrong; to break the Sabbath is to deny God and all that He has done for us
The keeping of the Sabbath by the children of Israel was a great sign that they recognized God and what He had done for them
All the assembly brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones and he died, as Jehovah commanded Moses'
Now, after the fourth rebellion, the rebellion of unbelief in spying out the land, some of the leading ones rebelled
Numbers 16:1 and 2 indicate that the rebellious spirit was spreading unto a thorough saturation among the people
The priests had the priesthood, the priestly service, and the Levites had the Levitical service next to them and were serving the priests
The same thing happened among God's people in ancient times and has been repeated again and again among Christians through the centuries
Although Moses was humble in falling on his face, he did not give up his God-given position as God's deputy authority
As God's deputy, or delegated, authority, Moses referred this case to God as the highest authority for His speaking, exposure, and judgment
Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram , but, speaking in a very eloquent manner, they answered that they would not come up
Even though Brother Nee was the one under attack, it was the church that was damaged, and it was God's plan that was hurt
At a very crucial time, when the Lord Jesus was going to Jerusalem to be crucified, He told His followers what would happen to Him
The mother of James and John even brought her two sons to the Lord, begging Him to put one on His right and one on His left in the kingdom
If you read through the Acts and the Epistles, you will see that this struggle for power was there from the beginning of the church life
Some rebels were on the border of the camp, some were with the mixed multitude, and some were very close to Moses, the leading one
The elders know that if they serve in a certain local church for several years, they will surely offend others
Some people are seeking for position and power, and if, because of the elders, they cannot get what they want, they will be offended
In chapter sixteen, Moses was bold and faithful in confronting a large-scale rebellion, a rebellion of two hundred fifty leaders
Concerning ourselves, we need to realize that without the Lord's mercy and grace we might be the same as Korah, Dathan, and Abiram
No matter what is happening on earth, God's government still stands, not only over His house, the church, but also over the entire world
In chapter sixteen of Numbers, God's judgment is threefold, coming from the earth, from heaven, and from within the people themselves
Korah gathered all the assembly, not just his company or party, against Moses and Aaron at the entrance of the tent of meeting
Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, telling them to separate themselves from among this assembly that He may consume the assembly in a moment
They, together with their wives, their sons, and their little ones, came out and stood at the entrance of their tents
They belonged to different tribes Korah, to the tribe of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, to the tribe of Reuben but they were quite close
After the earth had swallowed the families of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, there were still two hundred fifty followers of Korah
When the people came to offer at the altar, they were reminded of the rebellion and of God's judgment on Korah and his company
On the next day all the assembly of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron saying You have killed the people of Jehovah
He told Moses that He would consume the assembly in a moment , and He sent the plague to kill them under His wrath
God had judged them by the earth, by fire from heaven, and by the plague that issued from the germs within them
Any one of those judgments should have been sufficient to subdue them and to cause them to fall down before God and worship Him
They were so bold in their rebellion, not caring if they went to Sheol or the lake of fire, that they risked their lives, even their souls
After reading a portion such as Numbers 16, some of us may have questions about God's love, mercy, kindness, and forgiveness
To answer this question we need to realize that, according to the teaching of the Bible, God's forgiveness is of different kinds
In a particular situation God forgives, but He forgives through punishment; hence, this is a forgiveness with punishment
In 1 Chronicles 6:33-37, a record of the genealogy of Samuel, we are told that Samuel was a descendant of Korah
As the title of Psalm 88 indicates, this psalm was written by Heman, a descendant of Korah and a grandson of Samuel
In Numbers 17 the rods represented the leaders of the twelve tribes , and Aaron's rod represented the tribe of Levi
The record indicates that, without saying a word and without praising the Lord for His vindication, each man took his rod
The budding rod of Aaron was to be kept as a sign for the sons of rebellion, that their murmurings against God might be ended, lest they die
The budding rod was contained in the ark with two other things the hidden manna and the testimony of God, the law
The budding rod of Aaron typifies not a dead Christ but the resurrected Christ, the budding Christ, who imparts life to others
After God's vindication through Aaron's budding rod, they said, 'Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone
The next day God did a miracle not on a large scale but on a small scale causing Aarons rod to bud blossom and bear fruit even ripe fruit
Everyone should have been convinced and subdued, but the people of Israel still spoke words of rebellion to Moses
Similar things have happened through the generations, with the ambitious ones falsely accusing others of being ambitious
In Numbers 16 and 17 God's judgment and vindication clearly indicated that the rebels, not Moses and Aaron, had gone too far
Satan has been rebellious, he is rebellious, and his rebellion will not end until he is thrown into the lake of fire
Only one person, Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and also the Son of Man, can defeat this evil one, and He has defeated him
We should remember the word of the Lord Jesus to Peter: 'Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to have you to sift you as wheat'
Within a very short period of time, a person who had been blessed by the Father became possessed by the Devil, and even became Satan
Since this is the situation with fallen human beings, we should not expect to see the ending of man's rebellious nature
When Paul was about to be martyred, he wrote to Timothy, in his last Epistle, saying that all the people in Asia had left him
We have emphasized the fact that, even after God's judgment and vindication, the children of Israel continued to speak words of rebellion
These two signs, one negative and the other positive, were produced through the rebellion of Korah and his company
The negative sign is the cover of the altar made of the censers belonging to the two hundred fifty men who had been judged
Their service was judged by God, and the result of that judgment was a negative sign, the covering on the altar
The divine thought concerning enjoying eating and drinking Christ is in the holy Word but it has been hidden for nearly two thousand years
Numbers 18 unveils to us the charge or the duties of the Levitical service and the Aaronic priesthood, with their reward
The service of the Levites was to take care of the tent of meeting the tabernacle of the testimony which is a type of Christ and the church
In English the word priesthood is sometimes used to denote a body of priests, that is, a number of priests who have been grouped together
The word iniquity is used here to charge the priests not to make mistakes while carrying out their priestly service
The priests were required to fulfill their charge without making mistakes so that their priestly service would not have any iniquity
In the Bible the word sanctuary is used in a very ambiguous way; it may refer to the Holy Place, to the Holy of Holies, or to both
Numbers 18:7a says, 'You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for all that concerns the altar and that is within the veil'
The ark, which was within the veil, contained three items: the testimony of God , the hidden manna, and the budding rod
The priesthood, as the highest service rendered by God's people to God, was a great gift given by God to Aaron and his sons
If we would know the details concerning the riches of Christ, we need to come to the Old Testament and study all the types of Christ
These offerings were offered to God through fire and were consumed by holy fire as a satisfying fragrance to please God and make Him happy
The holy portions of the sons of Israel reserved from the fire included the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
The portions of the offerings reserved for the priests were to be most holy to them because these offerings were food for God
The heave offering and wave offering were given not only to the priests but also to the sons and daughters of the priests
Every clean person who belonged to a priestly house, a priestly family, could eat of the heave offering and the wave offering
The first ripe of all that is in their land which they bring to Jehovah shall be yours every one who is clean in your house may eat of it
In this message we will continue to consider the Levitical service and the Aaronic priesthood, with their reward, which is Christ
Even the firstling of an unclean beast, though it was not acceptable for offering to Jehovah, had to be redeemed
But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy
The Levites were to offer to Jehovah a heave offering from the tithes they received of the sons of Israel, a tithe of the tithe
We have pointed out that in typology the heave offering refers to the ascension of Christ, to the ascending of Christ to the heavens
In 1 Corinthians 2:2 Paul said, 'I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified'
Whether or not this is our situation depends on a basic factor working at our profession or occupation for Christ and not for ourselves
You may eat it in any place, you and your households; for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting'
The tithe offered to the Levites by the sons of Israel could be eaten by the Levites and their households in any place
God vindicated the priesthood not only by causing Aaron's rod to bud but, even more, by giving such a reward to the priests
By comparing the reward given to the priests with that given to the Levites, it is clear that the Levites' reward was much inferior
Our service to God today is not in the realm of material things, and therefore our reward is not in the realm of material things
The mixed multitude, those who were not clear about their status and family, lusted according to their fleshly desires
Immediately after the three ordinances were given, in chapter sixteen a nationwide, universal, popular rebellion occurred
Samuel's grandson, Heman, became a psalmist and a holy singer in God's temple under the Levitical service arranged by David
If the people had refused to give, all three the Levites, the priests, and God Himself would have had nothing to eat
At this juncture God came in to reconfirm His reward to the priests and to all the serving ones of the priesthood
By reading the whole chapter we can understand that the impurity, the uncleanness, refers mainly to the filthiness of death
A man became contaminated by touching a dead body , by being present when a person died , or by entering the tent where a dead body had been
After the death of the fourteen thousand seven hundred, virtually all the tents and every vessel in the tents became contaminated
Finally, in chapter nineteen, the water for impurity was invented to deal with the universal effect of death among God's people
On the day of propitiation, the blood of propitiation was brought into the tabernacle and was sprinkled upon the ark and toward the veil
The priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer'
In the water for impurity, there is the efficacy of Christ's redemption with the washing power of the Spirit of His resurrection
After this the entire situation of the children of Israel was cleansed from the effect of the death that came in from their sin of rebellion
Because there was no water for the assembly, the people 'gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron'
The people contended with Moses, and spoke, saying, If only we had perished when our brothers perished before Jehovah!
Why have you brought the congregation of Jehovah into this wilderness, that we should die here, both we and our cattle?
These contending ones wished they had died under God's judgment in chapter sixteen rather than live in the wilderness without water
Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the congregation to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces'
Moses did not dare to say anything to God, but when he came from the presence of God to the people, he spoke angrily to them
In Exodus 16:14-18 and 17:5-6, God supplied the Israelites with manna and water to meet their proper need, without any punishment
Because this was not a matter of necessity, He was angry with them and, in His anger and as a judgment, He supplied them with quails
When the children of Israel caused God trouble concerning necessities, He was not offended, but when they lusted, He was offended
Unable to curse him whom God has not cursed , Balaam said, 'He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob;/Nor has He seen trouble in Israel'
He was God's representative and had the position to represent God, but here he represented God to the people in a wrong way
His mistaken speaking made God common; that is, it did not sanctify God, did not make Him separate from all other gods
The God whom Moses represented was not angry; therefore, Moses, His representative, should not have been angry either
As a mother is offended when her child is accused and criticized, so God is offended when we accuse and criticize His people
In order to avoid giving such a wrong impression, we should be careful whenever we are offended by some of the saints in our locality
God's word to Moses about speaking to the rock that it may flow out water was a word according to God's administration and for His economy
Because of this, even though he was intimate with God and may be considered a friend of God, he lost the right to enter into the good land
Being careful about the way we speak concerning God's people when we are offended will help us remain in the kingdom of God
If you want to have a joyful married life, you need to forgive the offenses caused by your spouse and forget them
Concerning the Bible we should have a good memory, but concerning others' wrongdoings we should have a poor memory
Otherwise, we will have many negative things to say about the saints, and eventually we will forsake the church life
The blunder committed by Moses in Numbers 20 consisted in not having a positive and pleasant feeling regarding God's people
Sometimes we offend others because we do not remember that the church life and the saints are tender and touchy
Cases like this remind us that we need to learn always to be conscious of the tenderness and touchiness of all the saints in the church life
In chapter twenty of Numbers, God did not come in to vindicate Moses; rather, He came in to vindicate His people
Through our study of chapter twenty of Numbers, we may learn how to behave when others contend with us in the church life
Take your rod, go to the rock, and tell the rock to flow forth water so that My people and their cattle may drink'
Uttering praises to the Lord, Moses then should have simply spoken to the rock, telling it to flow forth with water
When Paul was writing the Epistle of 1 Corinthians, it is likely that he realized that the history of Israel is a type of the church life
Speaking of the things that happened to the children of Israel in the wilderness, he says in 10:6, 'These things occurred as types of us'
The lesson we need to learn from Moses' failure in Numbers 20 is that we should be very careful when we speak about God's people
Remembering offenses is risky, for it may cause you to lose your birthright, to lose your right to the enjoyment of Christ as the good land
According to the typology in this portion of the Word, water signifies the Spirit of life, or the life in the Spirit
Since the rock had already been smitten in Exodus 17, there was no need for it to be smitten again in Numbers 20
In 1 Corinthians 104 Paul speaking of the children of Israel says They drank of a spiritual rock which followed them and the rock was Christ
When we do this, we will experience the crucified Christ, the Christ who is emphatically presented by Paul in 1 Corinthians
Now that the Spirit has been given, there is no need for Christ to be crucified again that the living water may flow forth
In our hymnal there is an excellent hymn with deep spiritual significance on the relationship between the cross and the Spirit
The reason we are short of the Spirit of life is that we are lacking in applying the death of Christ to our present situation
If we apply the death of Christ to ourselves, this application will bring in the living water to supply our need and solve our problems
When God's people were contending for their necessities, God was not offended but was fair in taking care of these necessities
When her child cries out for milk, she will be sympathetic toward the child, cherish him, and supply milk to make him happy
Concerning certain things the mother will cherish her child, but concerning other things she will discipline him
Because He is fair, bountiful, and gracious, He has no problems with His people when they contend for food and water
It is not sufficient for us simply to be right with God; we must also be right in our attitude toward God's people
In order to complete this journey in a proper way, we need to know God in His nature, especially in relation to His people
Whenever we see something in God's people which, to our view, is not right, we need to consider the situation according to God's nature
Our attitude toward God's people should not be according to our feeling and preferences but according to God's nature
The way to deal with this shortage is to speak to Christ, for He is the rock that continually follows the church
Having accomplished everything related to God's economy, Christ is now in the heavens and in us, waiting to be the supply to meet our need
In Exodus 17 Christ in crucifixion is typified by the smitten rock, and in Numbers 17 Christ in resurrection is typified by the budding rod
Christ has accomplished everything for us, and, as the One who is both in the heavens and in us, He is ready to supply us
Whenever we speak to Christ as the rock, telling Him to give us living water, we must have the rod in our hand
As we speak to the rock, we must apply the death of Christ to ourselves and realize that we are crucified persons
Applying the death of Christ to ourselves as we ask Him for the Spirit of life is altogether according to God's economy
In the New Testament we do not have a chapter that reveals as clearly as Numbers 20 the way to receive the bountiful supply of the Spirit
In Numbers 21 the children contended again, but this time their contending was not fair, because it came from the people's impatience
God did not punish the people for their contending in chapter twenty, but He did punish them for their contending in chapter twenty-one
God had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt and had brought them into the wilderness, where the way was rough and very difficult
In their impatience they 'spoke against God and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?
Having confessed their sin in speaking against God and Moses, they asked Moses to pray for them, and he did so
Jehovah said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and every one who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live
Moses made a bronze serpent, and set it on a pole; and if a serpent bit any man, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived'
The Hebrew word translated 'looked at' in Numbers 21:9 may also be rendered 'regarded,' or 'looked intently at'
The bronze serpent could be a type of Christ who had the form the likeness of the flesh of sin but not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin
Long after Numbers 21 was written, Christ came, and in His conversation with Nicodemus He referred to the type of the bronze serpent
Israel's trying to get help from Edom signifies that we may sometimes try to help our spirit by depending on our flesh
The well which the leaders dug,/Which the nobles of the people hollowed out/With the scepter and with their staves'
According to Numbers 33:1-49, there were a total of forty-two stations, from the land of slavery to the land of rest
As a result of our reading of Numbers 1 through 33, we may have the opinion that there was nothing good with the children of Israel
Whether the church is marvelous or pitiful actually does not depend on what the church is; rather, it depends on what you are
If you have a negative attitude and view the church from a negative angle, you will not see anything good in the church
If you have a positive attitude and view the church from a positive angle, you will say that the church is marvelous
Concerning the church life in our locality, we should not be defeated or disappointed, and we should not lose heart
We need to view the churches in a heavenly way and realize that all the local churches are parts of the coming New Jerusalem
From our study of the book of Numbers, we need to learn that the way we look at God's people is a serious matter
At the conclusion of the journey of God's people in the Old Testament, there is a record of the forty-two stations
The correspondence here indicates that God's intention is to bring all His people to the good land as the goal
The end of the forty-two stations was the good land, which typifies Christ, and the end of the forty-two generations is Christ Himself
Everything has been completed, and everything concerning our enjoyment of Christ has been prepared and is now on the 'table'
Numbers 21:1-3, 21-35 reveals that the children of Israel defeated the kings of Arad, of the Amorites, and of Bashan
Using this portion of the Word as the basis, we released the messages that have been printed in the book The All-inclusive Christ
On the other hand, Canaan was a land full of evil persons and enemies, all of whom were to be eradicated by the children of Israel
In order to enjoy such a Christ, we need to fight against the spiritual enemies, against 'the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies'
We must defeat and crush the enemies signified by the king of Arad, Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan
Jehovah hearkened to the voice of Israel, and gave over the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities'
He gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel to the wilderness, and came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel'
We may speak to the evil spirits, asking them to give us a way through their territory, but this stirs them to fight against us
Bashan, which is mentioned several times in the Psalms, is a mountain standing in opposition to God's dwelling place
Today we must fight against the evil spirits and defeat them so that we may gain more territory for God's kingdom
In our Christian experience we may not have much realization concerning the spiritual warfare about which we have been speaking
The higher part of the spiritual warfare is the fighting in the spiritual realm against evil spirits and demons
Both the angels and the demons, as followers of Satan, are working on fallen human beings to make them subjects in Satan's kingdom
After defeating these three kings, the children of Israel were ready to cross the Jordan and enter into the good land
Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many; and Moab was distressed because of the sons of Israel'
Moab said to the elders of Midian, This congregation will now lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field'
Balaam might have taken the Lord's word to him as the basis for saying that in going with Balak's officers he was doing God's will
Eventually, because Balaam was striking the ass with his staff, God opened the mouth of the ass, and she spoke to Balaam
Although Balaam came to know the real situation seeing that the Angel of Jehovah was standing in the road in front of him he did not go back
If we seek the Lord's will but are actually inclined to carry out our own desires, we may deceive ourselves, even as Balaam deceived himself
In the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal; and from there he saw the extremities of the people'
Apparently, the offerings in the Catholic Church are offered to God; actually, these offerings are offered to different idols and images
No doubt, Balaam had the desire and the intention in his heart to curse Israel that he might please Balak and receive more money
As the One who was watching and ruling, the Lord put a word in Balaam's mouth, and Balaam had no choice but to speak God's word
He took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar'
One of the most striking lines in this parable is in verse 21: 'He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob;/Nor has He seen trouble in Israel'
How could Balaam speak such a word, since Israel was not perfect and since God could see all the iniquities of His people?
According to our view, a certain saint may have many defects, but according to God's view, this saint is perfect
How can we reconcile the word in verse 21 with the obvious fact that the children of Israel had many iniquities?
When God looks at us, He does not see us according to what we are in ourselves but according to what we are in Christ
In the same principle, God does not see iniquity or trouble in the church life, because the church is in Christ
After Balaam uttered his second parable, Balak said to him, 'Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all'
Rather, Balaam set his face toward the wilderness, lifted up his eyes, and saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes
The phrases 'whose eye is opened' and 'who hears the speaking of God' indicate that the prophet was on the alert
In the first parable he said, 'Behold, a people that will dwell alone,/And will not reckon themselves among the nations'
If we have God's view, we will regard Israel as a particular and separate people, as a sanctified and holy nation
The Jews are not welcomed by the nations in this age, but they will be welcomed by the nations after the Lord Jesus comes back
After the coming back of the Lord Jesus, Israel will be a healing to the nations, and that healing will be a great blessing
Both portions say that God brings Israel out of Egypt and that Israel has 'as it were the horns of the wild ox'
Balaam ended his third parable with a word concerning blessing and cursing: 'Blessed is he who blesses you,/And cursed is he who curses you'
In verses 18 and 19, Balaam continues, saying, 'Edom shall be dispossessed,/Seir also, his enemies, shall be dispossessed
But Israel shall do valiantly;/By Jacob shall dominion be exercised,/And those who remain from the cities shall be destroyed'!
Chapter twenty shows us Christ as the smitten rock who, in resurrection, is flowing out living water to meet our need
Because Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin, He could be our replacement, bearing God's judgment and accomplishing redemption
As our replacement, Christ has solved not only the outward problem of sins but also the inward problem of our sinful nature
These parables reveal much concerning the church, with the fourth parable revealing something concerning Christ
In Balaam's prophetic parables we see not only certain aspects of Christ and the church but also many of the riches related to the church
Numbers 24:6 and 7 speak of 'valleys that stretch afar,' 'gardens beside a river,' and water that flows from buckets
Ephesians does not tell us that the church is a garden by a river or that in the church water flows from buckets
The intrinsic contents, the intrinsic constituents, of this history are nothing other than Christ and the church
Having seen the picture of Christ and the church presented in Numbers 20 24, let us now go on to consider 25:1-18
The worshippers of Baal were fornicators, and they induced others to commit fornication with them and to worship the idol of fornication
In 25:16-18 and 31:2 we see the revenge of Jehovah on the Midianites because of the deceits with which they deceived the Israelites
The Bible presents a full record of the aspects and statuses of God's people, revealing what we are in Adam and what we are in Christ
In the sight of God, the people were heavenly, but according to their real nature, they were fallen and sinful
The experience described in Numbers 25 was in the night, but in Numbers 26 we have something related to the day
The renumbering in chapter twenty-six took place immediately after the purification by the plague on the fornicators and idolaters
Since the history of Israel is a complete type of the church the mixture among the children of Israel is a type of the mixture in the church
The point here is that there is mixture among God's people, and God uses the failure and turmoil among His people to purify them
The punishment in chapter twenty-five was the last purification of the children of Israel before they entered into the good land
Those who survived all the purifications in the wilderness, especially the last and greatest purification, were a purified people
In the Gospel of John we see the life of Gods house and in Johns epistles we have the fellowship of the children of God in the Fathers house
In order to be numbered, the children of Israel were required to be in the fellowship of the life of their fathers' house
If we compare the second numbering with the first, we will see that some tribes decreased, whereas other tribes increased
These verses indicate that the distribution of land to each tribe was according to the number of people in the tribes
The children of Israel were a peculiar people, a people who were for God and thus stood apart from the nations
Among this peculiar people there was an extraordinary tribe the Levites and this tribe was not numbered among the sons of Israel
The Levites were the tribe which was closest to God and which served God as the replacement of all the Israelites
Among all those who were included in the second numbering, none had been in the first numbering, except Caleb and Joshua
With the exception of these two, all those in the first numbering, including Moses and Aaron, were not in the renumbering
The daughters of Zelophehad said, 'Why should the name of our father be taken away from his family, because he had no son?
Anyone who did not have a house, even though he was a genuine Israelite, did not have a genealogy and was not qualified to be numbered
In order to be numbered, an Israelite had to have a strong standing related to the source of life and the channel of life
We must have a strong standing in the source of life, and we must have a proper channel for the receiving of the divine life
They wanted their father's inheritance to go to someone born for him that his name may be remembered among his tribe
If our experience of life is low and very limited, then our enjoyment of Christ will also be low and very limited
In typology, the good land signifies Christ, and the inheritance of the good land signifies our enjoyment of Christ
The church is signified by the father's house, which is mentioned in 26:2 and which is implied and assumed in chapter twenty-seven
The church today is the house of God , and we who once were strangers and sojourners are now 'members of the household of God'
As members of the household of God, we have the real source of life and the channels, the means, of receiving life
Although we have the right to enjoy the inheritance of the good land, in order to execute this right, we need the house and the channels
Many of us can testify that in the church we have received the divine life and have enjoyed the fellowship of the divine life
The receiving of the divine life and the enjoyment of the fellowship of the divine life result in the enjoyment of Christ
According to John 15, the proper enjoyment of Christ is a balanced enjoyment, for it is related to fruit-bearing
Those who give up the church life with the fellowship of life spontaneously lose their right to inherit the enjoyment of Christ
They could be at peace and enjoy the Lord's presence, confident that He knows everything and that He would take care of the situation
Jehovah told Moses to go up to the mountain of Abarim and see the land which He had given to the sons of Israel
The Lord said to Moses, 'When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was gathered'
The fact that Moses could not enter into the good land because of this failure does not mean that he will not be in the millennial kingdom
Although he was very old, he was concerned for God's people, realizing that they would be in need of a shepherd
Exodus 28:30 speaks of putting the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate of judgment, which was worn by the high priest
In David Baron's book The Ancient Scriptures and the Modern Jew there is an appendix with an article on the Urim and the Thummim
According to this article, the twelve names on the breastplate included eighteen of the twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet
On the breastplate with the additional piece called the Thummim, all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet could be found
According to this article, the Urim was an illuminator inserted into the breastplate underneath the twelve stones
When the Urim and the Thummim were added to the breastplate, they caused it to become the breastplate of judgment
The high priest received God's instructions and then passed them on to Joshua, who was responsible for their execution
The people would then go out and come in according to the instructions given to the priest and executed by Joshua
When the children of Israel came back from captivity, Joshua was the high priest and Zerubbabel, a royal descendant, was the leader
As we are eating our food, we need to remember that God also desires food and that we need to prepare something for Him to eat
Today God's desire and pleasure are not in animal sacrifices; God's desire and pleasure are altogether in one person Christ
Before we consider further the matter of God's food in Numbers 28, let us consider the sequence of chapters twenty-five through twenty-eight
God still had His number, and the total of those numbered in chapter twenty-six was nearly the same as the total in chapter one
At the time of the first numbering, there had not been any trouble or reduction in number through God's punishment
After the renumbering in chapter twenty-six, we have in 27:1-11 the statute of judgment for the women's inheriting of the land
Moses was one hundred twenty years old, and the Lord told him that the time had come for him to be gathered to his people
If the people do not have someone to lead them out and bring them in, they will be as sheep without a shepherd'
At the end of chapter twenty-seven we see a wonderful picture a picture of a new people, a new army, and a new leader
After all the events recorded in chapters twenty-five through twenty-seven, in chapter twenty-eight we have the crucial matter of God's food
At the beginning of every month, God wanted to eat something particular, and His people were required to prepare this food for Him
The people were also to offer a ram with a meal offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour and its drink offering of a third of a hin
In contrast to the daily and weekly burnt offerings, the monthly burnt offering had to include a male goat for a sin offering
The offerings in Numbers 28 and 29 follow two lines the line of ordinary human life and the line of the yearly feasts
The fifteenth day of this month was the beginning of the feast of unleavened bread, a feast which lasted seven days
On the first and seventh days of this feast, there was to be a holy convocation, and on those days no laborious work was to be done
As we are having fellowship with God, we and God will have the mutual enjoyment of Christ by eating and drinking Him
If we carefully read the book of Leviticus, we will see that the burnt offering is to be wholly and absolutely burned for God's satisfaction
The sin offering typifies Christ as our sin offering redeeming us back to God and solving the problem of our sin, sins, and failures
Having experienced Christ, we present Him to God as His food, and then God shares with us a portion of the Christ we have offered to Him
Christ became the Lamb of God who took away our sin and our sins so that God, in His righteousness, might pass over us
The feast of unleavened bread indicates that after we have been saved and regenerated, we should live a life without sin
Let us therefore keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth'
The day of the first fruits was the day on which Christ was resurrected, becoming the first fruit to be offered to God
The Spirit is the realization of the resurrected Christ Christ in another form for in resurrection Christ has become the lifegiving Spirit
The fact that these two loaves were baked with leaven indicates that those who form the two sections of the church still have sin
The feast of Pentecost was fulfilled fifty days after Christ's resurrection, on the day of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
In Christ's resurrection on the day of the first fruits, the members of Christ were produced for the formation of the church
In every step of the Christian life, there is something for God's satisfaction, for we are the factors of His satisfaction
Eventually, on the day of Pentecost, there are two loaves, signifying the two parts of the church, for God's satisfaction
The last three feasts are related to the Lord's second coming and will be fulfilled at the time of the Lord's coming back
After the Lord Jesus has descended from the air to the earth the Jews will repent mourn and return to God receiving Christ as their Savior
On this day, the people afflicted themselves, that is, they repented, mourned, and felt sorrowful for their sin
The feasts of the blowing of trumpets, propitiation, and tabernacles all took place within a brief period of time in the seventh month
The feast of propitiation will be fulfilled on the day of Israel's return to God, after they have been gathered back to their fathers' land
All the offerings described in chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine were in addition to their vows and freewill offerings
The feast of tabernacles will be not only the last feast but also the conclusion of God's work in the old creation
Eventually, after the millennium, all of God's people will be fully perfected and consummated to be the New Jerusalem
Eventually, we offer Christ to God as our Pentecost, which is the consummation of God's work for His new creation
Our being resurrected with Christ in His resurrection and our being saved are parts of the fulfillment of God's economy
When the church was formed on the day of Pentecost and so many were baptized into one Body, God enjoyed a wonderful feast
In Numbers 28 and 29 there are three sections the sections pertaining to daily life, to the Christian life, and to the future of Israel
Each section is for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy in which Christ is the centrality and the universality
In the church life today, we also have the two matters of fulfilling God's requirements and of making a vow to Him
According to church history, all those who were used by God to fulfill His New Testament ministry were volunteers
He fulfilled God's requirements, and he also made a vow, for the sake of the need in the church life, to remain unmarried
Numbers 30:3-5 speaks of a woman vowing a vow to Jehovah and binding herself by a pledge while in her youth within her father's house
Of having God as their Father and Christ as their Lord, they stand by themselves, bearing their responsibility
In chapter thirty-one we see that there was the need for the children of Israel to overcome the troublesome Midianites
In typology, the Midianites signify the filthiness of the lust of the flesh, which is related to the devil Satan and the world
With the flesh there is lust, and with lust there is filthiness, defilement, which is related to Satan and the world
The Midianites were one with the Ishmaelites, the descendants of Abraham by the flesh, who sold Joseph into Egypt
Moses spoke to the people saying Arm men from among you for the war that they may go against Midian to execute Jehovahs vengeance on Midian
Moses' strategy in fighting against the Midianites required that the children of Israel be in one accord with no dissenting opinions
We need to learn from this that in order to be in one accord for the Lords move we should not express our opinion but come back to the Word
There was one accord among the fighters, and there was one accord also among the rest of the children of Israel, including the women
The Israelites took captive the women and children of the Midianites and took as plunder all their cattle, livestock, and goods
Those who had killed someone and those who had touched a slain person had become defiled and needed to be purified
The people were required to purify every garment, every article of skin, all work of goats' hair, and every article of wood
All the metal gold silver bronze iron tin and lead were to be purged by passing through fire and then purified with the water for impurity
You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean; and afterward you shall come into the camp'
Because Eleazar the priest was one with Jehovah, whatever was given to Jehovah as a tribute by the fighters went to Eleazar the priest
The officers were not required to make such an offering; they did this voluntarily out of their own initiative
Their desire was to receive what God had promised, according to their choice as the best, not according to God's choice as the best
Eventually, their land was the first part of the land of Israel to be taken over by the Gentile invaders from the east
We need to learn the lesson of not considering what we have or what is in front of us but leaving our future in the hand of the Lord
We are shortsighted and somewhat selfish, so it is difficult for us to be pure in motive, desire, intention, goal, and purpose
Only after we have had the old man dealt with and buried are we in a position to talk about possessing the good land for our enjoyment
Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to the war while you stay here'?
If the other tribes follow your pattern, every tribe will have its own choice, and we will not have a way to distribute the land'
In verses 7 through 15 Moses warned Reuben and Gad with the pitiful story of Kadesh-barnea, a story of unbelief
Moses might have thought that they were afraid of the giants in the land and that this fear would have discouraged all the other tribes
We ourselves will be ready and armed to go before the sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place'
Of saying, 'until we have brought them to their place,' they should have said, 'until the Lord has brought them to their place'
Whenever we have our own choice, we will owe something for our choice and will be under some kind of obligation
Let us learn not to follow Reuben and Gad, but to follow the other tribes who allowed the Lord to make the choice for them
These statutes were given to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho , a land that has been the scene of much trouble
Christ has been given to us as our portion for our enjoyment, yet there is a condition which we must fulfill in order to have this enjoyment
Whether or not we can have the real enjoyment of Christ depends upon the extent to which there is a clearance of our inner being
We see that the children of Israel were to inherit the land according to two things: according to their tribes and according to the lot
The best part of the good land is surrounded by two seas the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea and a river the Jordan
The land given to the two and a half tribes, the land which was according to their choice, could be reached without crossing the Jordan
Our self-choice is likewise outside the death of Christ and therefore has nothing to do with the real enjoyment of the rich Christ
As indicated by the type of the good land, the Christ assigned to us through God's ordination is a great Christ, a vast Christ
In Himself Christ is universally vast and does not vary in size but our experience of this Christ may vary greatly and be different in size
These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun'
These are the men whom Jehovah commanded to divide the inheritance for the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan'
There should be some significance in the fact that this list does not include the names of the leaders of the two and a half tribes
The leaders in chapter one were for the numbering; the leaders in chapter thirty-four were for the distribution of the good land
In the priesthood, or in the ministry of the priests, there were many business affairs that required the service of the Levites
Forty-eight cities from the inheritance of the possession of the sons of Israel were to be given to the Levites for them to dwell in
The Levitical service was a service to the priesthood, and the goal of the priesthood was to bring fallen man back to God in resurrection
For the forty-eight cities given to the Levites, the large tribes were to give more and the smaller tribes fewer
The fortyeight cities given to the Levites were to be scattered among Israel changing Jacobs curse on Levi in Genesis 497 into a blessing
As Jacob was blessing his twelve sons, he pronounced a curse on Levi, saying that because of his cruelty he would be scattered
The cities of refuge were provided so that the manslayer who killed any person without an intent might flee there
The cities of refuge were to be not only for the sons of Israel but also for the strangers and sojourners among them
In the sight of God, we are those who sin without intent, and He considers our sinning as being without intent
Rather, the assembly, the congregation, was to have a group to judge whether or not one's fleeing to the city of refuge was legitimate
The Old Testament saints like Abraham, David, and Isaiah remained, spiritually speaking, in the city of refuge until Christ died
Since Christ, our High Priest, has died, He is our refuge, not in the Old Testament sense but in the New Testament sense
Christ has died and has resurrected, and now we are in Him, not merely as a refuge in the Old Testament sense but as our direct salvation
No ransom was to be accepted for the life of a murderer, who was guilty of death and who was to be put to death
Since no ransom was to be accepted, the one who fled to a refuge city had to remain there until the death of the high priest
If the people followed the regulations concerning the cities of refuge, there would be no blood shed for which there was no propitiation
As the book of Numbers reveals, in that narrow strip of land, the land of Canaan, God exercised His mercy, grace, wisdom, and sovereignty
Since the Old Testament age is over, do we today still have a city of refuge, or do we only have God's direct salvation?
As far as the forgiveness of sins and the assurance of salvation are concerned, many believers are still in the Old Testament
We who believe in Christ may have the assurance of salvation and the assurance that our sins have been forgiven
In the Old Testament age, the refuge cities were places in which to hide and to wait for the death of the high priest
Those who enter into Christ today may do so with the assurance that He has already died and that their sins have already been forgiven
The distribution of the six refuge cities in different places indicates that the Triune God is near and available
We all have made mistakes and continue to make mistakes daily, but the Triune God has spread to the very place where we are
Now, as the final matter pertaining to the prearrangement of the distribution of the good land, let us consider the statute in 36:1-13
The last matter to be covered in this book is a further statute concerning the females among Israel inheriting the good land
The heads of the fathers' houses of the families of the sons of Joseph requested the same kind of land for their tribe
Often the sisters are finer than the brothers in their concept and opinion; however, the sisters may be shortsighted
The heads of the fathers' houses had a view concerning the whole tribe and therefore requested the same kind of land for their tribe
Moses commanded the sons of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph has spoken rightly
God allowed the daughters to marry according to their taste but only within the family of the tribe of their father
Paul's word in 2 Corinthians 6:14 may help us to understand this: 'Do not become unequally yoked with unbelievers'
No inheritance shall pass from one tribe to another; for each of the tribes of the sons of Israel shall cleave to its own inheritance'
The daughters of Zelophehad did according to Jehovah's commandment to Moses, marrying the sons of their uncles
These slogans are a mingling of Old Testament typology and the fulfillment of this typology in the New Testament
We may say that the New Testament is hidden in the Old Testament and that the Old Testament is manifested in the New Testament
Like the children of Israel at Mount Sinai, we have also received the divine revelation and are being built up with the processed Triune God
We are being built up with the Son as the embodiment of the Father and with the Spirit as the realization of the Son
The term priestly army may be an Old Testament term, but it also fits the New Testament fulfillment of Old Testament typology
Although this word may not be used in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, the typology in these books unveils God's economy
In the Old Testament we have a picture of God's economy; in the New Testament we have a clear speaking concerning God's economy
In Genesis God's people were chosen, and in Exodus they received the divine revelation concerning God and His dwelling place
God's chosen people received the divine revelation after their participation in God's initial salvation as realized in the Passover
As the book of Exodus shows us, God's people did receive this revelation and they built the tabernacle according to it
As the God of love and light, He is altogether holy; that is, He is uncommon, different, and separate from everything else in the universe
He is righteous with Himself, He is righteous in all He does, and He is righteous toward man and all His creatures
John tells us clearly that God is love and light, and Paul tells us that the very God who is love and light is absolutely holy and righteous
By studying the commandments of the law, we can see that God is love and light and that He is holy and righteous
The ark in which the law was placed was called the ark of the testimony , and the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of testimony
God's people received the revelation concerning God Himself so that they might be separated unto the holy God as His sanctified people
The revelation concerning God's economy includes the revelation concerning the divine arrangement, administration, and purpose
The boards of acacia wood are a type of God's people, and the gold overlaying the boards is a type of the divine Person
The boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold signifies God's people being built up together with God to be His dwelling place
The Father is signified by the gold, for in typology gold signifies the nature of God, which, no doubt, is related to God the Father
If the lamps had not had oil, they would have been useless, and there would not have been any light in the tabernacle
In the Old Testament God's testimony was the tabernacle, and in the New Testament it is the church, the Body of Christ
There was a tabernacle in the Old Testament, there is a tabernacle in the New Testament, and there will be a tabernacle in eternity
Finally, God's chosen and redeemed people received the divine revelation concerning God's priesthood with all its offerings and its services
The book of Numbers as a whole reveals the need of God's chosen and redeemed people to be formed into an army to carry out the holy war
The presence of the cloud and the fire indicated that as the people were journeying in the wilderness, they were journeying with God
The title 'the Angel of Jehovah' is a particular title of Christ in the Old Testament, as revealed in Exodus 3
Because we, like the children of Israel, are often 'naughty children,' in addition to God's care and supplies we also have His discipline
In their fighting together with God and for God, the children of Israel defeated the king of Arad and destroyed his people
The kings defeated by God's chosen and redeemed people signify the spiritual powers, rulers, and authorities in the air
When we defeat the rulers, powers, and authorities in the air, the kingdom of God surely is spread and established
The tabernacle of the testimony signifies God's chosen and redeemed people built up with Him as His dwelling on the earth
Because the testimony, the tables of the law, was put into the ark, the ark was called the ark of the testimony
For a period of forty years, God's people, with the Angel of Jehovah taking the lead, camped and journeyed in the wilderness
Others may think that we are wasting our time but we in the Lords recovery are happy to use our time to care for and to bear Gods testimony
Whether you believe this or not, the fact remains that frustrations occur and, in a sense, actually are needed
The mixed multitude lusted exceedingly, and this stirred up the lust of the God-chosen and God-redeemed people
Lust was already present with God's people, but it needed to be stirred up, and it was stirred up by the mixed multitude
Numbers 11:5 says, 'We remember the fish we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic'
In verse 6 the people went on to say, 'Now our soul is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna before our eyes'
Moses was the God-chosen leader, and Miriam was a prophetess who, after the crossing of the Red Sea, led the women in praising God
She was condemned by God and suffered the punishment of leprosy , a disease which indicates that one's sickness is inward
In Numbers 16:1-12 we have the record of a corporate rebellion, the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and two hundred fifty leaders
Throughout the history of God's people, rebellion has been caused by the combination of ambition and the lack of capacity
They all wanted a higher position, but according to God's sovereignty, they did not have the capacity for such a position
To the rebels this was a judgment, but to the entire congregation of the children of Israel the whole matter was a frustration
Through this frustration the children of Israel were purified, and after this purification they were renumbered
Whether we realize it or not and whether we understand it or not, we need the purification which comes through the frustrations
From this we see once again that the record of the journey of the children of Israel in the wilderness is a record of our journey today
In this message we will consider the matter of God's chosen and redeemed people being ready to take possession of the God-promised good land
With the exception of Joshua and Caleb, those who were qualified and ready to take possession of the land were younger ones
The lessons learned by the first generation surely became part of the heritage passed on to the second generation
Their children certainly inherited from their parents all the lessons they learned during the forty years in the wilderness
By their birth the younger ones were put into a position to inherit the tradition of their family and all that their parents had experienced
They might have also explained that although they eventually felt that manna was loathsome, they nevertheless appreciated it
Moses himself was not allowed to enter into the good land, but he contributed many constructive factors to God's people
What the first generation experienced was not experienced in vain, for it was passed on to the second generation
What the older ones experienced actually was not effective for them, but it was very effective in building up the younger ones
As Exodus 14 reveals, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were all involved in the salvation of the children of Israel
Without the personal involvement of the Triune God, it would have been impossible for the Israelites to be released from the hand of Pharaoh
God's chosen and redeemed people enjoyed the heavenly provision and the divine care in their initial journey in the wilderness
In Exodus 15:27 they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, all of which refer to Christ
In Exodus 16 the people enjoyed Christ as the manna, and in Exodus 17 they enjoyed Him as the rock smitten to flow out living water
In their initial journey in the wilderness, God was to them a nursing mother, feeding, nourishing, and cherishing them
All this took place at the foot of Mount Sinai, where the people were given the law as a portrait of what God is in His attributes
He may purify us through fire, which is a matter of purging, and through water, which is a matter of purifying
In Numbers 32 and 33:50 36:13 God's people received the prearrangements for the distribution of the promised good land
For them to be settled in the good land was for God to be settled in the land, for they were to settle there with God
Let us first consider the full type of the church and then the matter of the mystical union with the all-inclusive Christ
The typology in Exodus 1, 12, and 14 indicates that the church has been redeemed from God's judgment and saved from the bondage of the fall
No matter what our circumstances may be, if we apply the crucified Christ to our situation, the bitter water will become sweet
At Mount Sinai the children of Israel received the divine revelation recorded in Exodus 19 40 and Leviticus 1 27
The children of Israel stayed at Mount Sinai for nine months, and during that time they were trained by the Lord
We may say that through this training they became a divinely cultured people, with God Himself as the main constituent of this culture
In the church life today, we also are being trained by the Lord in knowing Him, in being built up together with Him, and in serving Him
According to the book of Numbers, the children of Israel were formed into an army of God to fight for God's economy
In the sixth chapter Paul goes on to show us that the believers have been formed into an army to fight for God's economy
Before we were saved, we were traveling in this worldly wilderness by ourselves, but now that we have been saved we are journeying with God
Sometimes we may not want to walk with Him, but He continues to walk with us, and His presence changes our journey
At other times we may cause Him to be unhappy with us or we may not agree with Him, but we cannot get away from Him
Day by day, we may enjoy the all-inclusive Christ, the embodiment of the processed and dispensing Triune God, as our good land
Even the law is a type of Christ, for it typifies Christ as God's expression, bearing God's image that man may know God
According to Romans 3:25, Christ is the propitiation place the cover, or lid, of the ark for God to meet with man in His righteousness
John 3:14 and 15 reveal that Christ is the brass serpent to take away the sin of the believers that they may have eternal life
