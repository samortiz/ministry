<h1 class="title">THE SATISFACTION OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 4:14; 6:35; 7:38</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man&rsquo;s satisfaction is not found in material things<br />
<span class="normal">Even after a man has accumulated great wealth, he is not satisfied.</span></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s satisfaction is not found in psychological things<br />
<span class="normal">Even after man has received honor and fame, he is still not satisfied.</span></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s real satisfaction is found in his spirit<br />
<span class="normal">This satisfaction comes when God enters into man&rsquo;s spirit. Only God can satisfy the human spirit.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Fifty-seven</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE REAL LIFE</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Eph. 3:19</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God is man&rsquo;s true life<br />
<span class="normal">Since God is the meaning of life and the satisfaction of man, He is the true life of a man. If a man is without God, not only is his an empty life, but also a false life.</span></li>
<li>The real life is one that is filled with God inwardly</li>
<li>The real life is one that is absolutely living for God</li>
<li>The real life is also the living out of God Himself</li>
</ol>

<li>Repent and turn to God</li>
<li>Receive the Son of God as your Savior</li>
<li>Consecrate yourself to God</li>
<li>Practice being one spirit with the Lord</li>
