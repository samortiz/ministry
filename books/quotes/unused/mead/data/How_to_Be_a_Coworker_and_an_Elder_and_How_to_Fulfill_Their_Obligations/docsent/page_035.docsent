   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Pride Makes You a Top Fool</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is my realization of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The most foolish person is a proud person, and the most wise person is a humble person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be proud is to be a top fool.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rivalry in the Lord's Work Is Not Only a Sign of Ambition but Also a Sign of Pride</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We often are in rivalry with people in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For instance, a certain place began with thirty people meeting together and now they have reached one hundred thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Your locality began with forty people meeting together, but now you have only sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because you cannot stand someone being more successful than you, a heart of rivalry arises within you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the world, competition brings progress.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Lord's work, however, there must not be rivalry; rivalry kills.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to humbly say to the Lord, "O Lord, I am an unprofitable servant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even though there are more people meeting here with me than with the other brother, I am still an unprofitable servant."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Gospel of Luke the Lord told us that after a servant of the Lord performs many tasks during the day and comes home in the evening, he still has to say to his Master, "I am an unprofitable slave" 17:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all must admit that we are unprofitable servants.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should neither compare ourselves to nor compete with others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If there is an increase in the church where we serve, it is altogether the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In my prayer my greatest delight is to praise the Lord for His abundant mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and He will have compassion on whomever He will have compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have many people in your locality; it is the Lord having mercy on you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have few people in my place; this may be because I am proud before the Lord, so I need the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Always remember His mercy and His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Watchman Nee said that we should not be afraid of making mistakes, but we should be afraid of not having the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If there is the Lord's blessing, even though we have made a mistake, we are still blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Caring for Your Prestige and Neglecting Others' Dignity Are a Sign of Subtle Pride</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Caring for your prestige and neglecting others' dignity are a sign of subtle pride.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Co-workers and elders who are older are prone to commit the error of caring too much for their prestige.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a person would often say that he has been working for the Lord for many years, he has established churches in certain places, and he has nourished certain localities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He always cares for his prestige.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone has his dignity, so you should not rebuke anyone carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you do, that means you are displaying your prestige without caring for the other person's dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is also a sign of subtle pride.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Referring to Your Capacity, Success, Perfection, and Virtue Is a Careless Form of Pride</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Referring to your capacity, success, perfection, and virtue is a careless form of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not carelessly mention your success, your capacity, your perfection, and your virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, always say to the Lord, "Lord, I don't have any capacity nor do I have any success in Your work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, I don't have any perfection; all that I have is imperfection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Also, I don't have any virtue; all that I have is failure."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This will preserve you from becoming proud.</S>
