   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What if the submission offends our conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Submission is surely against your conscience if it leads you to worship an idol or to do something against the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Daniel and his three friends are an example of submission at the highest level, yet they did not defile themselves Dan 1:8-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1938 there was a sister in Peking whose unsaved husband greatly troubled her.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He would go to the theater and then not get home till after midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Her way of handling the situation was to lock the door and not let him in till he had been knocking for an hour or so.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When she recounted this story to us, we told her she must change her way in order to save her marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She asked us for advice, and this is what we suggested: "You have to submit yourself to your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When he wants to go to the theater, offer to accompany him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ride in the carriage with him right to the theater entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then tell him to go on in and that you will return home and wait for him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you get back home, cook his favorite snack and have it all ready.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As soon as you hear him knock at the door, open it right away and give him a warm welcome.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Offer him the snack you have prepared and sit down with him while he eats it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sister, if you will practice this, before too long your husband will be a brother in the church."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is what subsequently happened.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That theater-going husband became a brother because of his wife's submission.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I believe this story illustrates submission according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Submit as much as you can without defiling your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Matters pertaining to life may not be easy to explain, but they are easy to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Medical doctors spend years studying the physical body, but they do not know what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even a baby, however, experiences life just by breathing, without any instruction or study.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without understanding it, I enjoy my physical life; it enables me to speak and move.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The experience of life is just to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A hundred books cannot explain breathing, but the act of breathing is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So is life in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To experience the life of God, we must have the Son 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Life is a Person, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not think that jumping or shouting are indications of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Life is not a condition but a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether I sleep or jump, whether I shout or am quiet, I have life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sorry to say, it has often seemed to me that the ones who shout in the meetings are the ones who are short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who are rich in life have no need to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When they come into the meeting and sit down, life radiates from them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I remember the meetings in Shanghai in the early '30's. Brother Nee was twenty-nine, two years older than I. He would be in the meetings, perhaps not speaking, not praying, not even singing well, but full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there was a meeting and he was away, how much we missed him!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We would try hard to exercise in prayer, but we sensed a lack of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The life in just one person makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE REASON FOR THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why did God create the heavens and the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To accomplish His purpose, He needed the earth, the air, the sunshine, and the rain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All these things He made as the environment for the vine He wanted to grow John 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To our Father God, the earth is a vineyard in which He nurtures and tends the vine, His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet a vine amounts to very little without its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is it not marvelous that we are those branches John 15:5 ?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why does God have the church?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why has He gathered us together?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He intends to cultivate us, but not our natural life, as the outgrowth of this vine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the branches grow, the vine grows.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is our profession, our calling, our responsibility, to grow and produce this vine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we live Christ "To me to live is Christ," Phil 1:21 , we grow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we grow Him, we produce Him.</S>
