<P>First John 5:2-3 says, "In this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do His commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome." Why is it that we can keep God's commandments when we love Him? Let us look at John 14:21: "He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me." This says that if we love the Lord, we will keep His commandments. Brothers and sisters, who among us dares to say that he has kept all the commandments that God has given us? Never mind the unknown commandments, were all the known ones kept? Having God's commandments means to find them. How many believers plug their ears for fear that God may speak a commandment to them? We not only ought to obey when God commands us, we ought to find His commandments. Furthermore, we must keep them once they are found. Seeking God's commandments is our care for Him. This is loving God.</P><P>"He who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him" (John 14:21b). This speaks of the benefit of loving God. Though I have met many well-known children of God, I have yet to see but a few who know God. Many can read the Bible, but they do not know God. They may understand the Bible, but they do not know the power of God. Others preach without knowing what they are preaching because the Lord has not manifested Himself to them. Even if the Lord were to stand before them, they still could not know Him without His revelation. Many have not experienced the Lord's manifestation because they do not love the Lord; neither do they keep the commandments of the Lord. Only one kind of people love the Lord on this earthâ€”the faithful ones.</P><P>Never go to big and popular places to look for those who know the Lord. Oftentimes you will find one serving God in a secluded place or in a simple house. When you see such a one, you meet God's presence. Some people always stir my respect. Others may be zealous, capable, kind, humble, and gentle, but one does not necessarily see God through them. A certain one asked me once, "What were the strong points of this missionary?" I said, "There was always the sensation of God every time I saw her." This is God's revelation. You should remember the great woman of Shunem who said to her husband, "I perceive that this is a holy man of God, which passeth by us continually" (2 Kings 4:9). What had Elisha shown this woman? He did not perform any miracles. Rather, every time he came, he gave the woman the sensation of God. Brothers and sisters, do we love God's manifestation? If we do, we should employ every means to find God's commandments and keep them.</P><P>"If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him" (John 14:23). God and Christ are present with all who believe in Him; however, God and Christ only make an abode with those who love Him. It is not just a matter of presence, but of an abode. A presence at times cannot be felt. But when one faithfully seeks God's commandments at all costs, he will experience the Lord making an abode with him.</P><P>John 15:9-10 says, "As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love." What does abiding in the Lord's love mean? We all sensed how much the Lord loved us when we were first saved. But today we do not sense His love that much. Though we can still speak of the depth of the Lord's love, we do not feel it. If we abide in the Lord's love, we should always sense such a love. Abiding in the Lord's love is just affording Him the opportunity to love. In other words, it is to be enveloped in His love. When others oppose and forsake us, we will really know how the Lord loves us. If we always find God's commandments and obey them, we will abide in His love. Did the Lord not sense the Father's love for even a single moment? He was constantly in the Father's love because He kept God's commandments. In order to abide in the Lord's love, we must always keep His commandments. If the love of God is in us, we can keep even the most difficult of His commandments. Some forsook their parents, some their wives, others their positions, and still others their fame, all because they loved God. They were enabled by the very love of God.</P><P>Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God." Many know this verse well. Only one kind of people enjoy the good: those who love God. If you do not love God, perhaps not even one thing is working for you. God does not alter things; He changes your heart. If you love God, then all things, though unaltered, will work for your good. Sometimes you complain about everything that comes your way. You complain concerning this and concerning that. Yet if love is there, all these will mean nothing to you. Loving God will make an unsatisfactory environment a profitable one.</P><P>First Corinthians 2:9-10 says, "But as it is written, `Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man's heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him.' But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit." What do we see in these two verses? What God has prepared for those who believe is eternal life, yet the thing which God has prepared for those who love Him is in the future. Only those who love God can know of this coming blessing. If someone tells you about a marvelous thing he saw, it surely will not be comparable because the coming blessing has not yet been seen by eyes. If someone tells you about a wonderful thing he heard, it also must be a lesser thing than the coming blessing because no ears have heard it. If someone can indeed imagine the unsurpassable best, it still cannot compare to the coming blessing because it has not yet entered into the heart of man. Nevertheless, God has revealed to us by His Spirit this thing which no eyes have seen, no ears have heard, and what has not entered into man's heart. In other words, a lover of the Lord may enjoy what men have not seen, heard, nor dreamed of in this life. When God discloses His glory to you, you will exclaim, "Oh, what joy!" This heavenly glory is so much that you will find it hardly bearable.</P>
