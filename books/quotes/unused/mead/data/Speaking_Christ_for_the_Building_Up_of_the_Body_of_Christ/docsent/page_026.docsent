   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Could you give a little more explanation regarding not needing a prearranged program for our meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Quite often in the church, we need to call a special gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every special gathering has a special purpose and for that gathering we need a definite subject, a definite program, and even some prearrangement as to who will bear the burden for this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But for the regular meetings of the church, there should not be a prearranged program or a definite subject.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should come together and leave the entire meeting to the guiding Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Question: Suppose some saints want to come together to go over a truth lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is a definite subject.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How does this fit in with what we are seeing regarding the meetings not needing to have a definite subject?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a very good question.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the saints need to learn the crucial truths in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the long run, a local church must have a time, either weekly, bi-weekly, or at least monthly, to have a meeting for the teaching of the truth to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of teaching of the truth should not depend upon what we call regular church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The publication that can help us learn the truths to the uttermost is Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In using the Truth Lessons we should not follow the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must take the new way of practicing the learning of the Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even with this matter, we should not be too definite regarding what or how much we will cover in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may have made a prior decision to cover a certain truth lesson in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when we come together, we may realize that this lesson is too long.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may be able to cover this entire lesson in four meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, when we come together, an instant decision may come out, and we may decide to only cover the first part or the first few pages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Someone may even be burdened to cover the final fourth of the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should go along with this proposal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may wonder how we could cover the fourth part when we have not covered the previous three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But quite often we can learn more this way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am sharing this to impress us that it is better not to control, limit, or restrict the saints that much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is always a profit to keep the meeting open and depend on the Lord s instant leading.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But on the other hand, we should not be too loose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are too loose, many opinions will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A sister who was a medical doctor once came to me and told me that our church needed a hospital, and she encouraged me to promote this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some people who are Ph.D. s may feel that we need to establish some schools.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These are opinions from the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not be too loose in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, the door will be open for many opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to learn to restrict and limit this element, but we should not be too strict or controlling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, there are actually no regulations, but we are always under God s guidance and leading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Question: I have been in some localities that practice getting into a certain book of the Bible with the help of the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They come together for a meeting of fellowship, and the content of this meeting is usually what the saints have labored on with the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What do you feel about this practice?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A lame person who wants to walk may need a cane to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the strength and health of his legs are eventually recovered, though, he will no longer need this cane.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Likewise, when we start to practice the new way, we may need a little help.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But eventually when everybody is regularly contacting the Lord and having enjoyment in the word, they will gain an accumulation of the experiences of Christ and a living storage of the living word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, everyone will be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we come together in this state, everyone will have something to present from the storehouse in his being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Probably right now many of us do not have any savings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We only have a checking account with one dollar and fifty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we practice the new way, however, eventually, perhaps within six months, we will all have some savings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then it will be easy for us to write checks in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, we need to prepare.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because we may only have one dollar and fifty cents in our checking account now, we may need to borrow something by using the Life-studies, the Truth Lessons, or the Life Lessons in the regular church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is nothing wrong with this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But we must learn to bring the saints into a stage where they can drop all the canes and the helps because they have the accumulation of the experiences of Christ and the riches of the truth from the living word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we continue to take the scriptural way, we will reach a stage where most of the saints are rich in the experience of Christ and in the enjoyment of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then when we come together, it will be easy to have a rich feast with many courses.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To use something like the Life-studies is not wrong, but be careful that the saints do not build up a habit of relying on this too much.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Otherwise, they may not have a desire to contact the Lord in the morning to accumulate some riches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They may build up a habit of only preparing a little bit on the assigned pages of a certain book.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That is not good for the long run and builds up a bad habit.</S>
