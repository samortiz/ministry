   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapters we have seen that the Lord is our life supply as water for us to drink and as food for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have also seen that the food is in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaiah 55 tells us that when we come to the waters, we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The tree of life as the food grows in the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, if we are going to eat the tree of life, we have to come to the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must come to the water to get our food.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Isaiah 55:1 tells us that when we come to the waters we eat, and we "buy wine and milk without money and without price."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is hard to say whether milk is water or food because milk is food in water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Wine is the same in principle as milk; it is food in water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Wine is made from grapes, which are food.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The food is in the water, and the water is in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When water becomes vapor, it gets into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The air sends water to the earth in the form of rain, and the water on the earth vaporizes and goes back to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are devices called vaporizers which convert the water into vapor for inhalation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After a certain time the water in the vaporizer goes into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we stay in a room where a vaporizer is being used, we breathe in the air and get the water because the water is in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Genesis 2:5-6 says, "And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mist from the earth is the vapor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Plants grow to produce food by being watered, and the water comes from the air.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The air sends the water, and the water issues in the food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Ezekiel 47 we saw that along with the water are the trees for food.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This food came from the water, and the water comes from the air.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we want to get the food, we have to go to the water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are going to get the water, we need the air.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are going to eat, we have to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are going to drink, we have to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we breathe in the air, we have the water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, in the water we have the food.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, the air is the breath, and in the Bible the breath is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In both the Hebrew and Greek languages, the word for Spirit is the same word for breath.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Greek word for Spirit is pneuma, and the Hebrew word for Spirit is ruach.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Ezekiel 37 this Hebrew word is translated into three words: Spirit, breath, and wind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The American Standard Version points out in the margin of the text that breath can be translated into Spirit v. 5 , wind can be translated into breath v. 9 , and breath can be translated into wind or Spirit v. 9 .</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The essence of God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as wood may be the essence of a table, Spirit is the divine essence.</S>

   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually, all of these negative things will be put into the lake of fire Rev 20:10 , but we believers will be the constituents of the city of water, the New Jerusalem Rev 22:1 .</S>
