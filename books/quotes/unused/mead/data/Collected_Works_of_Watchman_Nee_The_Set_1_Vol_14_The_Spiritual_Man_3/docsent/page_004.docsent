   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MIND UNDER THE ATTACK OF EVIL SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we examine all the experiences in the minds of the believers, we will realize that the minds of the believers are not just narrow; they also have many other sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, the mind is affected by thoughts and imaginations that cannot be controlled, filthy pictures, wandering and chaotic recollections, sudden loss of memory, prejudices that come from nowhere, lack of concentration, thoughts that are stagnant and obstructed as if the mind is chained, or fanatical thoughts that turn uncontrollably.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Believers always feel that they have no strength to control their minds or direct them according to the will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, they often find themselves prone to forget about all kinds of things, great and small.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They find themselves unknowingly committing many "indiscreet" mistakes, without ever bothering to learn the reason for committing them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As far as their body is concerned, they do not seem to have any illness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet they do not clearly know why their minds have these symptoms of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many believers' minds today are like this, but they do not know the cause.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a believer realizes that his mind is affected in the way mentioned above, he only needs to consider a few things to know where these ailments come from.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He only needs to ask himself a few questions: Who controls his mind?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Does he control it?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If he does, why is he unable to control it now?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Is it God who controls it?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the principle of the Bible, God does not control man's mind for him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will speak in detail concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For now, we will only mention it in brief.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If neither he nor God controls it, who does?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It has to be the authority of darkness who usurps the mind and brings forth these kinds of symptoms.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, when a believer sees that he cannot control his own mind, he should know that this is the enemy's work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One point should always be remembered: man has a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's goal is for man to rule himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man has the authority to rule over all of his own faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the mind should come under the rule of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A believer should ask himself if he has such a mind, and if his thoughts are his own.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they are not his own, they must be the work of evil spirits who work within man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The will does not want to think, and the mind desires to obey the will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In spite of this, the mind finds itself continually thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that the thoughts in the mind are no longer his own thoughts, but the work of another "person" who is utilizing his thoughts against his will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a believer does not choose to think, the thoughts that are in his mind are no longer his; they belong to evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a believer wants to differentiate which thoughts are his own and which are evil spirits, he should pay attention to how his "thoughts" come about.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If his mind is initially quiet, steady, unperturbed, and working according to its disposed position, and suddenly, an idea or a thought comes like lightning that is totally unrelated to his work or his disposed position or is totally out of order, then the flashing thought is the work of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Their intention is to inject their thoughts into the mind of the believer, fooling him into thinking that they are his own thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a rule, the thoughts that evil spirits inject into man's mind are always something that he does not have and something that is contrary to his usual train of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are totally "new" and are sudden ideas that the person has never thought of before.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After a believer has such a thought, he should first ask if he is thinking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is it really him thinking?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Does he want to think this way?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Or is the "thought" itself being stirred up in the mind?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Is it something he does not want and has never thought of before?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A believer should find out if he is thinking the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If he has not originated the thought and is, in fact, against such a thought, even though the thought somehow finds its way into his mind, he can conclude that the thought has come from evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the thoughts that his will never endorses, and all the thoughts that are actually against his will, are thoughts that are not from man himself, but are from outside.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many times the believer's mind is full of thoughts, and he finds himself unable to stop these thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His mind head is like a thinking machine, which has been "turned on" by an external force, thinking continually and uncontrollably.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even though a believer shakes his head incessantly and tries to reject such thoughts, he is not able to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The tide of thoughts comes like a rolling wave and refuses to stop day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Most believers do not know the reason for this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Little do they realize that this is the work of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A believer should know what is "a thought."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A thought is his mind grasping a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But in an unstoppable train of thought, it is no longer the mind grasping a matter, but a matter grasping the mind!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Originally it was the mind thinking about things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now the mind is not thinking about things, but things are compelling the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many times a believer wants to drop a matter, but an external force seems to remind him in his mind all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It does not allow him to forget and forces him to keep on thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the work of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In short, a believer should investigate all abnormal phenomena.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Unless they are due to natural illnesses, all abnormal phenomena are from evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God does not interfere with the functions of man's natural faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God never interjects His thoughts suddenly into man's thoughts, and He never cuts off the work of man's mind suddenly or robs him of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All sudden stoppages of thoughts that feel like the brain has become void, sudden appearances of incoherent thoughts in the mind, sudden lapses of memory in the middle of thoughts that feel like a snap of electric wire, or a continual inability to exercise the mind or memory are the result of the works of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because evil spirits have occupied the faculty of the mind, they can seize it at times and stop its functions, or they can relax it at other times and make it active again.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A believer should realize that natural causes can produce only natural illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sudden thoughts and sudden forgetfulness are beyond the control of our will and beyond the course of natural events.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For this reason, they must be from some supernatural source.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If a believer examines all the phenomena of his mind this way, he will not be ignorant of the reasons for his symptoms.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The book of Ephesians tells us that evil spirits operate "in the sons of disobedience" 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Evil spirits work not only outside of man but also inside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we want someone to work, at most we use words and expressions and other body movements.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But evil spirits can do more than these.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are able to work not only from the outside, as from one man to another man, but they are able to operate within man.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This means that they are able to penetrate into man's mind and work within him, causing man to obey them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Man cannot penetrate into the mind of another man and stealthily suggest many things in private to him, nor can man cause another man to be confused about the source of these suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But evil spirits can do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They have ways that are unavailable to man in his normal communication with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>First they work in man's mind and then reach man's emotion because the mind and the emotion are closely connected.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They also begin from the mind and work their way into man's will because the mind and the will are also closely connected.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The way they move is by stealthily and secretly putting their favorite thoughts into man's mind in order to accomplish their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Or they may prevent man from thinking anything that they do not want him to think about.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Bible clearly teaches that the authority of darkness can give thoughts to man as well as steal thoughts away from man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>John 13:2 says, "The devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, that he should betray Him."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This speaks of the way Satan puts his thoughts into man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Luke 8:12 says, "Then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This speaks of how Satan takes away the word which man should remember so that man forgets everything.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>These two verses tell us of the two kinds of work that evil spirits perform in man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>By these verses, we can identify the works of the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Their works are always to add or subtract something from the mind of man.</S>
