   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The following is his second personal testimony, given in Kulangsu, October 20, 1936 concerning the overcomer conferences:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has shown me that in every local church a group of overcomers should be raised up as those mentioned in Revelation 2 and 3 to be the Lord's witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason, every year an overcomer conference has been held to faithfully deliver the messages that God has given me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Watchman's first overcomer conference was held in Shanghai in February 1928.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His messages were on the eternal purpose of God and the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He unveiled the mystery that a spiritual warfare has taken place: God had a plan to accomplish, but His enemy Satan, the power of darkness, opposed it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, Christ defeated Satan in His death on the cross and won a full victory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now God's need is for believers in Christ to share His victory and fight against the power of darkness by executing what Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The number attending the first conference was fifty, at the most.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Twenty or thirty were from outside Shanghai, mostly from the northern province of Kiangsu and the county of Ping-Yang in Chekiang province.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The audience was small, but the impact and the result were great.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second overcomer conference was held in Shanghai from October 8-18, 1931.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The announcement of the conference in the The Present Testimony, published in May 1931 reads:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The purpose of this conference is to unite all the believers in every place who are of the same mind that they might wait before God and receive the message which comes from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our past experience tells us that we must all receive deeper edification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason we must lay much emphasis on the testimony of "the victory of Christ," which the Lord has committed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May those who intercede before the Lord pray in one accord for this conference that we may genuinely have the power which is purely of the Holy Spirit with no mixture of soulish power whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Watchman's burden in this conference was the covenant of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He unveiled the real meaning and content of the new covenant God enacted for us through the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God first dealt with His people by His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, He promised His people in His Word that He would do certain things for them according to His plan; then, His Word became His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When His promise was accomplished in Christ, it became the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When He bequeathed the fact to His chosen ones, a covenant was established.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This covenant is the new covenant, which is better than the old one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was established through the blood of Christ and supported by the ministry of His indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These messages were first delivered in this second overcomer conference, then published in The Present Testimony from 1932 to 1934, and later printed as the first half of a book entitled What Is the New Covenant?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In November of 1932 he held a special conference with the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At that time eight brothers and sisters came to have fellowship with us from the Brethren assemblies in England, the United States, and Australia.</S>
