   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CO-WORKERS AND ELDERS TAKING THE LEAD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO EXERCISE FAITH AND NOT BE DISCOURAGED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church in Taipei has now been practicing the small group meetings for more than a year and a half.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For a time the situation did not seem promising at all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everywhere there were complaints that this way does not work and that the saints were dying.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some groups could not go on by themselves and decided to join with other groups.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now after a year and a half, everyone has learned some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was an impossible task for some at the beginning, but those who endured to the end saw the result.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After two or three weeks, or a couple of months, the group meetings resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is an easy thing to resuscitate the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If two or three people are too few for a meeting, all we need to do is to bring two or three more into the meeting, and the meeting will become strong and vibrant again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After another two or three months, we may have more than twelve people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time we can even subdivide the group.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I suggest that the co-workers and elders first be encouraged themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must never be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once we are encouraged, we should encourage the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should tell them that we would join their meeting and strengthen them whenever there is a need.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course, to strengthen does not mean to replace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must encourage the saints to take care of the meeting themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It does not matter whether they are skillful at taking the lead in the meeting, or whether they know how to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If they cannot sing the hymns, at least they can read the words.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as we have the Lord s word and as long as we have His Spirit, there will be life, and life will enliven men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever we do, it is better than not doing anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we consider a person unqualified to begin a meeting in his home, that person may never again be able to open up his home.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He may remain unqualified for the next twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must always encourage the saints and support them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the long run they will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I believe that if we practice this more and more, we will find the secret; we will know how to render the proper hygiene and the proper nutrition to people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this reason the co-workers and the elders must never be discouraged; they must have full confidence and a steady faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE BENEFITS OF MEETING IN THE HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A big meeting may consist of three hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If fifty are missing from such a meeting, no one will notice it; the meeting will still look proper and full with the remaining two hundred fifty people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the co-workers and elders look at such a meeting, they may be led to think that the meeting is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, once we break up this big meeting into the homes, we may have only five or six people in each meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we look at such a meeting, we may feel that it is a very sloppy meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everyone may be a disappointment and discouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After joining a few of these meetings, we may even lose our heart for working as a co-worker or an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To us, these meetings are too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Indeed, when we break up the whole into pieces, the sight is not always comely.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After some time, however, when we add the pieces together again to see the whole, we will find that the total number has increased.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, we believe that when someone opens up his home for meetings, his home will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The unsaved ones will be saved, the backsliding ones will be recovered, the fallen ones will be uplifted, the cold ones will begin meeting again, and the dormant ones will begin functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The family life in that home will also improve.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There will be light, and there will be the proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No one will dare to be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of course, the fruit-bearing may not come immediately, but the situation will only go upward.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It will not deteriorate, because gradually, one by one, everyone will learn to know something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In short, it is always better for a home to have a meeting than to not have a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some have asked, Do we not emphasize the matter of having a proper testimony in the Lord s recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What testimony is there when some people bring the meeting to the homes?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These meetings are sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some even play cards and smoke right up to the time of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Of course, this kind of thing is possible, but we should never be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we enter a home and see the people playing cards, do not stop them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Wait until they finish their game.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then take out the Bible to meet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some may criticize, saying, What kind of church is this?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They have a card game and then follow it with a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You allow such people to have meetings in their homes?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even if you allow such people to have meetings in their homes, I would not dare to bring any new ones to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we bring someone to the door and they see the card game, are we not corrupting them?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Have we not spoiled the testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I cannot argue with that.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, we should consider the matter from a long-term perspective.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We cannot look merely at the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is true that this home has a card game today, but after two weeks the card game may move to a hidden place.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After another two weeks the game may disappear altogether, and after another month the host may decide to burn the game.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the story of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At the beginning the host may not be able to overcome the game.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To be sure, he will eventually overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He may even throw away the card table.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we look back at that time, we will see that had we not brought the meeting to his home, he might still be playing cards.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He may not have experienced any growth in life even after five or ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>NOT BEING DISCOURAGED, NOT LOSING HEART, BUT BEING STRENGTHENED TO WORK FOR THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the kind of gospel work that we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The gospel is the power of God unto salvation Rom 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Through the gospel, life and incorruption are brought to light.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some become weak after they are saved and turn back to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should not be alarmed, much less give up.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must be bold and encouraged to go to them to nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we cannot pray or read the Word when we stand in front of an idol, it proves that we are not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we are strong, we can pray, read the Word, and sing, even if we are in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The co-workers and elders must be that strong before they can do a persistent work.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Nothing can turn us back.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should be able to work under any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I am not joking.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I have personally experienced all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When I was in north China, I was frequently busy with the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Now I have other burdens and do not have the time to be personally involved in the gospel, but at that time, every day I rode my bicycle to visit people from door to door.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Some homes had idols in them.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Some homes were possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I was bold to preach the gospel to all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I went to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I went to preach the gospel and to announce the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I was dispensing the Lord to them.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Lord Jesus said, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill Matt 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We all need such a spirit to work for the Lord in a bold way.</S>
