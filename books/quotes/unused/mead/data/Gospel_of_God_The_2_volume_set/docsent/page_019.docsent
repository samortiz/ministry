   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God So Loved the World</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God Himself is love, but when this love is applied to us, we find that "God so loved the world" John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"God is love" speaks of His nature, and "God so loved the world" speaks of His action.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God Himself is love; hence, that which issues out from Him must be love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where there is love, there must also be the object of that love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After showing us that He is love, God immediately shows us that He loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has not only loved us, but has also sent forth His love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God could not help but send forth His love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He could not help but love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The greatest problem the world has is that it thinks that God always harbors evil intentions for man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man thinks that God makes severe demands, and that He is strict and mean.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since man has doubts about the love of God, he also doubts that God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But as long as God is love, He loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If love is His nature, He can conduct Himself toward man in no other way except in love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It would make Him uncomfortable if He did not love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a fact!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He cannot help but love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is love, and what spontaneously follows is that God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can blame ourselves for our sins, for being susceptible to Satan's temptation, for being entangled by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But we cannot doubt God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You can blame yourself for committing a sin, for having failed, for succumbing to temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if you doubt God's heart toward you, you are not acting like a Christian, for to doubt God's heart toward you is to contradict the revelation in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I cannot say that you will never fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nor can I say that you will never sin again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps you will fail and you will sin again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But please remember that for you to fail or sin is one thing, but God's heart towards you is another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must never doubt God's feeling toward you simply because you have failed or sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although you may sin and fail, God does not change His attitude toward you, for God is love and He loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is an unchangeable fact in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On our side, we change and turn.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But on the side of the love of God, there is no change or turn.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times your love can change or become cold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But this does not mean that God's love is affected.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God is love, no matter how you test Him, what comes forth from Him is always love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If there is a piece of wood here, no matter how you hit it, you will always get the sound of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you hit it with a book, it will give you the sound of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you hit it with your palm, it will still give you the sound of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you hit it with another piece of wood, it will again give you the sound of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If God is love, no matter how you "hit" Him if you reject Him, deny Him, or cast Him aside He is still love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One thing is sure: God cannot deny Himself; He cannot contradict Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since we are just hatred itself, it is altogether natural for us to hate.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since God is love, it is altogether natural for God to love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God cannot change His own nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since God's nature cannot be changed, His attitude toward you cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So we see that God loves the world.</S>
