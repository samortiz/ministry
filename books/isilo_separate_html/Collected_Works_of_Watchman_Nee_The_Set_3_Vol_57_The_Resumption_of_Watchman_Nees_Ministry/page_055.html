The co-workers do not have the adequate understanding. In the bread-breaking meeting, we can say that everyone opens his mouth and prays. But in the matter of service, we have not seen everyone serving. We do not have every brother and sister becoming a priest. In the meetings the only thing that everyone can do is sing. It is true that the priests sang in the Holy Place, but that was not the only service. Today not everyone is serving. Only when the priests and the people become one entity is there the church. Our service today is only the service of three or five people; it is not the service of the whole Body. We have become the Jewish nation of today, with only one tribe serving, while the other eleven tribes rely on the service of the Levites. Other than the "Levites,'' no one else is qualified to serve any longer. Yet God's desire is that the whole Body would serve.</p><h2 class="head2">The Way Today Being for the Whole Body to Serve</h2><p>My co-worker brothers, no matter how prevailing your ministry is, how many gifts you have, and how useful and strong you are, as long as you replace others' service, you are a Nicolaitan! Not only do you have nothing to boast of; you have to confess your sin instead. Personal godliness does nothing to build up the church; it actually tears down the church. The way of the work, the proper way, is to help every brother and sister do the work himself or herself. It is not a matter of much service or little service. It is a matter of everyone serving. Unless we are all serving together, we are not the church. This is our way today. It has to be the church that is working. It has to be the church that is preaching the gospel. It has to be the church that is saving souls. No matter how well we work, as long as we are replacing others, we are one of the Nicolaitans. With us there is only the ministry; there is no church. Even if we are a so-called spiritual giant or a revival evangelist, if we do not bring in the service of the whole Body, whatever we do, we are failures.</p><h2 class="head2">The Whole Body Taking the Gospel as Our Center</h2><p>The gospel is our occupation. Everything else is done on the side. We have to take the gospel as our center. Our occupation is only to keep ourselves alive and to sustain our body to live on this earth; the purpose of our occupation is for the gospel. The real preaching of the gospel is done by the whole Body. The preaching of the gospel by three or five cannot be considered the real preaching. We need the whole Body, that is, everyone, to preach the gospel. If the brothers and sisters see that the church is a Body, they will no longer be individualistic. The most blessed and happy thing is to give oneself to the gospel. Only when our money is with God will we be joyful. Many people may have too many material riches with them. This is why they are not happy. If they would lose some of what they have, their joy would increase. This is a great matter. The matter is not whether one's occupation is high or low. The matter concerns what we are here for. Some work in their jobs, while others take care of their families at home. But everyone has to give his all for the gospel.</p><p>I heard what Brother Witness Lee has done in Chefoo. I also heard what he has done in Shanghai. All these works are good. But I would add one thing: In the matter of consecration, everyone must have a part. Everyone has to hand himself over. If every brother and sister hands himself or herself over, the next generation will not need such a word. By that time, as soon as a person is saved, he will hand himself over and be consecrated.</p><p>Why do we baptize people? What is the meaning of baptism? Baptism means that we come under the name of the Lord. When a person comes out of the water, he should know that henceforth he no longer belongs to the world. Rather, he belongs to the Lord. Baptism separates a person from the world. We need the "handing over'' as the make-up lesson only because the baptism of many people was not up to the standard at the beginning.</p><p>In the future, when we preach the gospel, there will be no need to put up big advertisements or propaganda. Men will hear and see the gospel. They will see that everyone is serving. If there are three thousand people, all three thousand will be coordinated together. Everyone will be working, and everyone will be serving, but no one will be murmuring.</p><h2 class="head2">Realizing the Glory and Grace of Serving God</h2><p>Brothers, how should we answer God's call? In the old days men tried to usurp the priesthood. Today the priesthood is in our hands already. Are we going to cast it aside? What the Israelites lost was lost; they could no longer recover it. Are we going to make the service of God something cheap in our hands? For some, service to God is a matter of doing God a favor. But we have to see that for God to allow us to serve Him is His grace and favor on us. When a man does not see the glory of serving the Lord, he calculates everything. But when he sees the glory of serving Him, he will kneel before God to beg for this service. Recently, the newspaper said that China Textile Corporation is issuing new shares. When the stock market is up, everyone wants to buy. As long as they have money, they put it into the market. Do we see the glory of serving God today? Those who see it will surely give their all for it.</p><p>Those who are standing far off do not know God's grace. Those who know God's grace and know themselves do not count the cost... [Note: At this juncture, before the above words were finished, some brothers broke down in tears. Sister Pearl Wang also broke down in tears.]</p><p>Brother Witness Lee's concluding prayer: It is not that we can give You much. It is what You want of us. May You grant us a more absolute, thorough, and serious service. Amen.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> </body></html>
