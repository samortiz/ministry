   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have only one person, and our person is the soul.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The spirit of man was created by God, in a particular sense, to complete God's purpose in the creation of the heavens and the earth Zech 12:1; Isa 42:5; Job 32:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are living on the earth with the supply from the heavens for the purpose of being one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God created an organ within us for this purpose.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It says God created the heavens and then the earth with the plant life and animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when the record comes to the creation of man, it gives us a particular point.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This point is that within man, God created a spirit out of His breath of life.</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God created the heavens for the earth, God created the earth for man, and God created a spirit for man so that man can contact Him to be one with Him organically.</S>
