   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>He who makes big promises and speaks empty words appears to have great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But actually, he has no faith at all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you have faith, you should take off your coat and let another put it on.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You should invite others to eat your food.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you only talk about faith, you do not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, James concluded that this kind of talk is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The point here is not that faith is wrong, but that speaking empty words is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Last night we talked about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The night before last we also talked about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But we have not paid attention to this kind of faith yet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Inasmuch as James was opposed to it, we are opposed to it, too.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is useless to speak empty words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 19 says, "You believe that God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You do well; the demons also believe and shudder."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a very strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You believe that God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You do well to believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The demons believe this too, but they shudder.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Please take note of the word "and."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The question today is not whether or not you believe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you say that you believe, no one can say that you do not.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The problem is that even the demons believe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But they do not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The apostles did not write to the demons, saying, "Peace be unto you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>May God bless you and the fallen angels with you."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the demons believe, they shudder.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That kind of faith does them no good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their faith makes them shudder and lose their peace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you say that you believe, is your believing the kind of believing that the demons have?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>James's words are very strong and sharp.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Undoubtedly, you do believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the demons believe, too.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You say you believe, but at the same time you shudder, fear, and are nervous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, you are standing on the same ground as the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we read on, we understand what James is against.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>James is not against faith at all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is against a certain kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>James is not saying that faith will not justify.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is merely saying that this certain kind of faith will not justify.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 20 James calls these people by their names.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He calls them what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He does not call them brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He does not call them his beloved, as Paul did; nor does he call them fathers or little children, as John did.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, he calls them vain men.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"But are you willing to know, O vain man, that faith without its works is useless?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Notice the words "are you willing" here.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That James says this proves how hard their attitude is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When others speak God's Word to them and warn them, they still will not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, James asks if they are willing to know that this kind of faith is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not that they are unable to know or that they are unable to be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not that no one will teach them how to know.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is simply a matter of their not being willing to know.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose I try to speak to a brother, and he looks away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When I try again, he looks the other way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I try a third time, he begins to talk to another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I would then say, "Brother, are you willing to listen or not?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is what James is saying here.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are you willing to know that this kind of faith without works is dead?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we read the Bible, we have to ask God to show us the circumstances under which the portion was written.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>James calls this kind of people vain men.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They put everything out in the open for others to see and talk about and thus exhibit themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They want to have a share in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They want to speak up wherever they are.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>James says that this kind of person must be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>O vain man, are you willing to know that this kind of faith is useless?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because they will not listen after he has spoken so much to them, he has to taunt them and shout at them a little.</S>
