   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is diligence?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the opposite of slothfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not shirking from responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A diligent person does not try to reduce his work to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the contrary, he tries to create work out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Lord's service, it is quite possible for us to take a day or two of rest if we do not look for work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not be those who stand around idly waiting for something to turn up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we work only when work turns up, we are not diligent persons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A diligent person is never idle; he is always looking for things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is always pondering, praying, contemplating, and considering before God as to what he should do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Unless he exercises himself this way, he can find himself with nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we only act "according to the book," we may soon find that there is not much of a book left.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should expect to find much work in our service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should discover many needs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to pray much to the Lord and look to Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should open our eyes, and as soon as we find something that needs to be done, we should do it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we finish a job, we should wait on the Lord and look to Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And as soon as we find more to do, we should tackle it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Following this, we should seek God's will again, and take on yet another task.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what it means to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord said, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working" John 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must never change this verse to read, "My Father is resting until now, and I also am resting."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Laziness is not our way; our way should be, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should ask the Lord, "What work do You have for me to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the Lord's conversation with the Samaritan woman, He asked His disciples a very strange question: "Do you not say that there are yet four months and then the harvest comes?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest" 4:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to His disciples, the harvest would not be ready for another four months.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But according to the Lord, the harvest had already come.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In man's view, one had to wait four months, but the Lord said, "Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The lack today is men who would lift up their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone wants to wait for four months to work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today many people are hiding at home instead of journeying in God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their eyes are not on what God is doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In John 5:17 the Lord said that He was always doing what His Father had sent Him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In John 4:35 He told us to lift up our eyes and look.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not lift up our eyes, we will not see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The matter of work is altogether related to the matter of diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It involves our conscientiousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not a matter of taking care of what is in our hands, but a matter of lifting up our eyes to look for things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is moving and acting behind many things, and we have to lift up our eyes to look for them in order to find them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to lift up our eyes to see the harvest and to see if it has ripened.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once we look, we will find work to do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How strange it is that so many people seem so idle; they seem to have nothing to do!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who have the intention to work will always find work to do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who have no intention to work are always afraid that work will come their way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A diligent person always waits on God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As soon as he is free, he goes to the Lord and looks for things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is always seeking an opportunity to work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A brother once said, "Brother So-and-so is not doing his job.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So many brothers from out of town are here, and he will not spend any time to fellowship with them."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Another brother asked, "Why do you not tell him?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first brother answered, "Does something like that have to be said?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A servant of the Lord should always be waiting on God for things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Of course, this does not mean that he should move around and make a fuss ostentatiously.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But it does mean that the Lord's servant should always be seeking God and looking to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He should build up the habit of lifting up his eyes and looking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If he is truly busy, God will not burden him with further work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But as soon as his time becomes available, he should ask, "Lord, what do You want me to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As long as we will lift up our eyes, we will find that many people need our service.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who always have nothing to do have only one reason they are used to being lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They live a lazy life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They are lazy by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When something is put in their hands, they take more than ten days to finish what others can finish in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They have no motivation for work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Brothers and sisters, we have to actively seek for work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we have not looked to God for work, prayed for work, and found work, we are lazy, and we will not be able to accomplish much work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even if we are given five or ten more years, we still will not get very far with our work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A basic requirement of a worker of the Lord is to be quick with his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As soon as a need arises, he should know what to do and how to move.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Without this trait, he will not find any work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our spirit has to be sensitive to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we are not sensitive, we will be slow to react to things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to pay attention to lifting up our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should not follow what others say.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should not assume that there are four months to the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have to hear what the Lord is saying: "Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is amazing that some walk by the fields every day and yet have no eyes to behold.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They think that they still have to wait four more months!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They walk by needs every day, yet they do not find anything to do!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Their hands have already touched the things that they should do, yet they still say that they do not know what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>How strange this is!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Brothers and sisters, we have never seen God use a man who was slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Those whom God uses are men who expend their energy, who always look for things to do, and who are never loose.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They jealously guard the passing moments and never put off until tomorrow what can be done today.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Those who are loose with their time have little use in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some people will not move unless they are pushed to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They are like grandfather clocks; others have to set them in motion before they do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If no one pushes them, they will not move by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Such ones are of little use in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>No matter where we go, as long as we find brothers who are laboring and diligently working, we find results.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God has done great works in many places because many people labored diligently behind the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In some places God's work suffers a setback because some have been slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We have never seen a lazy person who was greatly used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Often the underlying reason for failure in the work is nothing but slothfulness.</S>
