   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING PRACTICAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN CARRYING OUT SPIRITUAL EDUCATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: If we have not graduated from elementary school, is it all right for us to teach at the kindergarten level?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: You should not focus on how to teach others; rather, you should study how to teach yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You want to skip many grades and study the twelve kinds of precious stones; this is unrealistic.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church has been on the earth for two thousand years, and the study of the Bible has not yet reached that level.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning the revelation of the twelve precious stones, we have just begun to see a little.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, you should diligently study the basic truths, such as the condition of man, justification, reconciliation, and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, you should be perfected under the leadership in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During the Sino-Japanese War, there was an educator named Chang, who founded Nankai High School and later Nankai University.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He realized that the only way to save China was through education; therefore, he carried out an educational work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we also have such a view, our work will certainly be different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we look at the present world situation, how can any country be well-governed without an educational system?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To rule a country, one must first pay attention to education.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not approve of revolutions; however, in order to have a beneficial revolution, the people must first be reformed inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such an inward reformation begins with education.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If China had gathered together her talented people to develop a strong educational system, the situation in China today would be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In violent revolutions people fight and oppose each other, and there is a never-ending, fierce struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After China overthrew the Manchu Dynasty, she was always in the midst of a revolution, and this dragged the country into a state of poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The result was that the common people had no way to make a living, and they even lost the opportunity to obtain an education.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today as we preach the Lord Jesus, expound the Bible and spiritual matters, and build up the churches, we must carry out a spiritual education; otherwise, the church will have no future.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I pity the ones who created troubles among us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way that they took did not merely harm them personally but also harmed others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they had been willing to be content and not overreach but function according to their measure, recognizing the flesh, dealing with the self, following the spirit, and learning the truth, they would have been exceedingly useful in the Lord s hands today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, they were unrealistic and would not carry out a practical work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The entire world is open to the Lord s recovery, but we lack manpower.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, I encourage the younger generation to consider carefully the way that you will take and not to be impractical.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The truth is the truth, just as two plus two always equals four.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And just as there is only one Lord Jesus, one Spirit, and one God, so there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If another church is produced, it must be a mistake and is not according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The people who have left the Lord s recovery have a hard time in their daily living, because even though they dare not say that the church is wrong, they are not willing to return to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They should come back to the church with a heart of repentance, and they should cease from their inward struggles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even though they once knew the church, now they say that this is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, deep in their heart, they know that there is no justification for their stand against the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since they cannot acknowledge the unique oneness, they are not in unity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is their situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must take a practical and humble way, and we must do our best to work in a practical way without opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord has opened a wide door on the island of Taiwan, but regrettably we have not used the good economy, peaceful society, talented people, and the educational system in Taiwan to cooperate with the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must wake up and begin to research how to make an elementary education wide-spread and successful among us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are almost one hundred churches in Taiwan, which means there is much work that we can do, and this work can be easily accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we must not be unrealistic; rather, we must be practical and begin from the basics.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must begin by teaching the basics, and our teaching should enliven the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not focus on topics like the twelve precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should speak the basic truths that bring salvation, such as the condition of man, justification, and forgiveness of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must also learn to reject our opinions and not to exalt others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1 Corinthians Paul says, What then is Apollos?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And what is Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ministers...So then let no one boast in men, for all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas;...all are yours 3:5, 21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul did not exalt himself, and we should not exalt others, and I beseech you not to exalt me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The concept of exalting people is deep in our bloodstream.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must root it out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the same way, opinion is also deep in our bloodstream.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today in Taipei there are many who have dissenting opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If in the future they are able to do a small amount in the work, will they not feel even more strongly that they are excellent?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If this is the case, they will expose their shortcomings and cast themselves aside.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As long as you have opinions, there is no need for others to abandon you; you have already cast yourself aside.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Opinions are intolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Over the past sixty years the problems that we encountered in the Lord s recovery are the issue of dissent, opposition, and criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the church life we must never dissent, oppose, or criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, we must be encouraging of others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Neither should we think that only the elders and co-workers are capable.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should all do our best to function.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should never justify ourselves, nor should we try to be unique.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the meetings you should speak according to the speaking of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the brothers are speaking on the chapter Clothing and Food from Messages for Building Up New Believers, you should follow them and speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The key point is whether or not you have any content.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you lack content and the ability to speak, you should not simply express your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Opinions are useless, and opposing others is also useless; the only thing that is helpful is to be practical and quiet in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It does not matter which district meeting you go to, you must stand up to speak for the Lord and supply life whenever you are given the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You must have something real to give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It does not matter who speaks eloquently and who does not; the important thing is how much you supply the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Your training must begin with this path so that you will become useful workers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Things that are very high and very deep can be brought in gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Taiwan is now a vast field, and no one is cultivating it in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everyone is working in a scattered way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I hope that you will wake up and begin to work from the most basic foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>KNOWING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>FOR THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Question: When we react differently to a certain matter and are able to overflow with the Lord s virtues, is this an indication that we have some experiences of transformation?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Answer: Life and truth are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we hear the truth concerning the condition of man, we should consider whether this is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this way the truth will become our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The subjects that we study in school, such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, or geography, do not always relate to our living.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, the truth that we study must become our living.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we hear the truth concerning justification, reconciliation, and sanctification, we should ask ourselves whether it is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When the truth becomes our experience, our living, it is the reality of our life, and this transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We may feel that we have grown in life simply by listening to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But whoever feels that he has grown in life has not really grown.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In our physical life we have been growing since the day we were born, even though we did not feel that we were growing.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>A person who has growth in life understands the truth and experiences the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Our experience of life usually follows our knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The experience of life comes mainly from the opening of the truth; it is rare to have growth in life without the opening of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>A person cannot get saved without hearing the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we do not know the truth, it will be difficult for us to experience the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We must make progress in the truth, because our progress in the truth causes us to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, if we study the truth without allowing it to work in us, we will merely be engaging in theological research.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>True growth in life cannot be separated from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we have no knowledge of the truth, it will be difficult for us to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Hence, we must study the truth diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Furthermore, what we experience must be added to our study of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We should not worry about how transformed we are; rather, we should consider our experience of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we have not experienced an item of the truth, we should pray until it becomes our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Our experience of life never surpasses our knowledge of the truth; however, our knowledge often surpasses our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This means that we first know the truth and then have the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is especially true of the ministers of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When their speaking does not surpass their experience, their speaking is weak and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If a person speaks a strong, rich word, it is because his knowledge of the truth surpasses his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The more his knowledge of the truth surpasses his experience, the stronger and richer his speaking will be.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>However, his experience must follow.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If his experience does not follow, the level of his truth will never increase.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In order to raise the level of our truth, we must have the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Hence, the reality of life depends on having the experience concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We must do our best to know the truth.</S>
