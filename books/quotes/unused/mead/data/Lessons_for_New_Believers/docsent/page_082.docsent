   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON TWENTY PREACHING THE GOSPEL THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The gospel preaching we refer to is not the preaching commonly referred to by others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, we are referring to fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The preaching that others generally refer to is done by preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Fruit-bearing, however, is the responsibility of every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible says that every believer is a branch in the true vine, which is the Lord Himself John 15:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The unique responsibility of a branch is to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since preaching the gospel is fruit-bearing, it is a responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, gospel preaching is not a special profession carried out by specialists.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is the daily responsibility of every Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one should regard gospel preaching as a profession.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every believer should regard gospel preaching as a responsibility of his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is significant that the Bible uses a vine to describe our relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are various kinds of trees.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some, such as sweet osmanthus and cherry trees, are appreciated for their blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others, such as the pine and the juniper, can be used as raw material.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Still others are not appreciated for their blossoms and cannot be used as raw material; they are solely for bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among this group of trees, the most obvious is the grapevine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The vine can never be used as raw material, and its branches are not even good for fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The flowers of the vine are almost non-existent because they are tiny and they only bloom for a short period.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, they are not worthy of any appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, grapevines are solely for fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Other fruit trees, such as the peach tree and the pear tree, have attractive flowers and can also be used for timber.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the vine is neither good for flowers nor for timber; it is solely for bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible uses numerous kinds of trees as types of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, in Song of Songs 2:3 the Lord is typified by the apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that the Lord Himself bears fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the vine best portrays the relationship between the Lord and us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are branches of the Lord Jesus who is the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The branches of the vine are for bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Fruit-bearing is their sole responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Aside from bearing fruit, there is nothing else that they do.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, since we are branches of the Lord as the vine, our responsibility is to preach the gospel, save sinners, and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE LIFE OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Gospel preaching is neither a profession nor an outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Gospel preaching is related to the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every kind of life has its own ability.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Fish can swim in water, and birds can fly in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Swimming and flying are abilities of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fact that trees can bear fruit is also an ability of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Trees do not bear fruit because of outward behavior but because of their inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even though bearing fruit is an outward manifestation, it shows the ability of the life within a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since gospel preaching is a kind of fruit-bearing, it is an ability of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must see that the regenerated life is within every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This life has many abilities, that is, many characteristics and functions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One of these characteristics and functions is to preach the gospel, and not merely to preach the gospel but to preach the gospel under any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Believers have a special instinct the urge to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not a hobby; rather, it is the life of a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, cats cannot be forbidden from catching mice; neither can dogs be prohibited from barking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Catching mice and barking are characteristics of the cat and dog life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Similarly, Christians preach the gospel out of a characteristic of the life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the reason that the brothers and sisters respond enthusiastically whenever the church preaches the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They willingly spend their energy and money because the life within them is a gospel-preaching life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The life within us is not merely a holy life, a loving life, and a meek life; it is also a gospel-preaching life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we try to not preach the gospel, we will feel uneasy and unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the contrary, when we preach the gospel, we feel joyful and at ease because we are following the nature of our inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we want to grow, we must allow the inner life to develop so that the characteristics and functions of this life can be freely manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once we allow this life to develop and be expressed, we cannot help but preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, we should not have the concept that since we have joined the church, we should encourage others to join the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Neither should we think that since we are members of the church, we should preach the gospel only when the church is encouraging us to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Preaching the gospel under these circumstances is not a spontaneous expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must understand that gospel preaching is neither a religious activity nor a pious behavior for a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is altogether a matter of life.</S>
