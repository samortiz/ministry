   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR FIVE KINDS OF FORGIVENESS Scripture Reading: Eph 4:32; 1 John 1:9; John 20:23; James 5:15-16; Matt 6:14-15; Gal 6:7; Luke 6:37-38; 2 Sam 12:9, 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to Ephesians 4:32, we were forgiven by God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to John 20:23, the disciples have the authority to forgive: "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to 1 John 1:9, if we confess our sins, He will forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Matthew 6:14-15, if we forgive others, God will forgive us, and if we do not forgive, we will not be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to James 5:15, if we have sinned and we ask the elders to come and pray for us, we will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By reading these five passages we note that they all speak of the matter of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They also speak of five different kinds of forgiveness, not just one kind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE ETERNAL FORGIVENESS GRANTED</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>BY CHRIST JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first kind of forgiveness is eternal forgiveness because God forgives us for Christ's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we have this forgiveness, we are saved for eternity; we will never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the Lord forgives our sins, we know that we are saved for eternity; therefore, this is eternal forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>INSTRUMENTAL OR PRONOUNCEMENTAL</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John 20:23 the Lord told His disciples that the sins they forgave were forgiven and vice versa.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rome has built a system of forgiveness on this verse, teaching that their priests have the authority to forgive or retain sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know that this is false.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What did the Lord tell the disciples that they had authority to do?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the meaning of this passage?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We know that the Lord is the only One with authority to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He was on earth, He said to one man, "Your sins are forgiven" Matt 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Jews objected because they thought that God was the only One who had authority to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John 20:23 does not speak of eternal forgiveness, but of forgiveness granted by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you are a sinner who believes in the gospel and applies for baptism or the Lord's supper, the church has something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the church believes you are truly the Lord's, they will receive you, but if not, they will reject you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This forgiveness is an instrumental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God uses the church to pronounce whether sins have been forgiven or not.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover we must connect verse 22, which says, "Receive the Holy Spirit," with verse 23, which says, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shows that if the church is in the power of the Holy Spirit and they say that a man is saved, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If they say that he is not saved, he is not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This does not mean that the church can cause a man to be saved or unsaved, but that the church is the instrument of God to pronounce whether or not a man is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So far we have seen two kinds of forgiveness: eternal forgiveness and instrumental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we need more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>RESTORATIVE FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After we have become a Christian, we often fall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We know that we should not and yet we do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sins of the past have been forgiven and yet we sin again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must go to God and apply for new forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our position as to eternal forgiveness is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No question can ever be raised regarding eternal forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once God has forgiven our sins, He will not revoke His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if we sin after we have been saved, we lose our communion with God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are still His sons, but we cannot look into His face.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If your son sinned against you, he would not be disinherited because of his sin, but he would lose his fellowship with you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There would be a barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a Christian we cannot lose our life, but we can lose fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is impossible to lose eternal life, but it is possible to lose our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we sin as Christians, we must get new forgiveness; otherwise, we cannot have communion with God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Remember that 1 John was written to Chris- tians; therefore, he is dealing with the sins of the saved, not the unsaved .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Word says that if we confess our sins, we will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a saint sins, he must go to the Father and confess, "I have sinned, please forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous" 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is at the right hand of the Father for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He presented His whole work before God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In His merit we can look up to God, confessing our sins and accepting His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This forgiveness differs from eternal forgiveness; it also differs from instrumental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the church says that we are saved, it is an instrumental pronunciation of salvation, but this forgiveness restores our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we can call it a restorative forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Forgiveness is for sins in regard to eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Forgiveness is for our position among the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Forgiveness also restores us to fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The first is a matter of salvation, the second is a matter of the church, and the third is a matter of life in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We now have forgiveness in regard to eternal life, the church, and the family of God three different kinds of forgiveness.</S>
