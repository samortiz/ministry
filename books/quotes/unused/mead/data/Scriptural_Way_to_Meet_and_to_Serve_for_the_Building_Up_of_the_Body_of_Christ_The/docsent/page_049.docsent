   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Bearing the Fruit of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Bearing the fruit of the Spirit is also a result and manifestation of the infilling of the Spirit Gal 5:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Galatians 5 there are nine items listed, including love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, there are many more Christian virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul only listed nine for illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These are all signs of the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>ECONOMICALLY, IN THE ASPECT OF OUTPOURING Speaking in Tongues, Prophesying, Healing Sickness, and Doing Miracles</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The economical filling of the outpoured Spirit is the outward aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Speaking in tongues, prophesying, healing sickness, and doing miracles are clear evidences of the outpouring of the Spirit Acts 2:4; 10:45-46; 19:6; 1 Cor 12:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we have seen, prophesying in the sense of speaking Christ and speaking forth Christ is related to the inward filling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, prophesying to predict something is a sign belonging to the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Speaking the Word of God with Boldness</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Speaking the word of God with boldness is a genuine and necessary sign of the outpouring of the Spirit Acts 4:8, 31; 13:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The most important aspect of visiting people by knocking on their doors is to speak the word with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even a little weakness in our speaking is a sign that we are not under the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must exercise our faith in God, in the ascended Christ, and in the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we will have the assurance to say what we want to say.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will have the boldness, not to shout in an empty way, but to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To speak with boldness means that in our speaking there is something solid in content and in authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People will recognize that this is not ordinary speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even a learned professor will recognize this boldness in a young sister.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This boldness in speaking is seen in Acts 4:31.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time the apostles had been threatened not to teach in the name of Jesus Christ in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, when they came back together, they prayed to such an extent that the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they began to speak the word of God with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we go out to knock on doors with fear, nothing positive will result.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This shows that we have been defeated and plundered by the enemy already.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must pray until we are filled with assurance and then go out with the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The outpouring will be upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is something miraculous, but to our feeling it will be so normal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all have to exercise such a faith with full assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we can speak with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we exercise our spirit to speak, we speak in boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To speak with boldness is a strong sign of being under the outpouring of the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our praying or speaking in any meeting must be with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not just to shout, but to speak with something in our spirit which cooperates with the Spirit that rests upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to believe the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Regeneration, the infilling of the Spirit, and the outpouring of the Spirit are normal things to us because they have already been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because my wife prepares breakfast for me, I can simply sit down and eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only have all the groceries been purchased, they have also been cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is placed on the table is ready for me to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not need to worry or do anything; I simply eat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To come to breakfast is so normal to me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The infilling and the outpouring are also normal to us because our God, who has gone through all the processes, has done everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can enjoy the outpoured Spirit because Christ became a man, lived on this earth, went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death, rose from the dead, ascended to the heavens and was enthroned there, received the promised Spirit, and finally poured out this Spirit upon His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today this Spirit is upon His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as we are a part, a member, of His Body, we are under this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because the descending Spirit is now resting upon the Body of Christ and we are a part of the Body, we are under this resting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit is here, so we may apply Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not need to do anything but exercise our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We know with full assurance that the resting Spirit is upon us, and we go out to preach the gospel with this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not be afraid of anything; we do not need to tremble.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even a shy, young sister should not be afraid to visit people with the gospel because she should have the full assurance that the descending and resting Spirit is upon her.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If I did not have any money, I could not walk into a restaurant and sit down in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I would worry about my lack of money to pay the bill.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I could not even talk to the waiter in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Eventually, I would excuse myself and leave.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, if I had one thousand dollars in cash in my pocket, I would walk into a restaurant without any anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I could enter in normally and sit down to order in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can go out to preach the gospel with boldness because we are filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can be regenerated, filled within with the Spirit, and apply the outpoured Spirit so normally because all things have been done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the gospel there is an invitation which says, All things are ready; come to the marriage feast Matt 22:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Incarnation is accomplished, human living is accomplished, the all-inclusive death is accomplished, resurrection is accomplished, and the ascension and enthronement are accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even the outpouring of the Spirit upon the Body of Christ is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not need to accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We simply exercise our faith and come to receive and apply whatever has been accomplished.</S>
