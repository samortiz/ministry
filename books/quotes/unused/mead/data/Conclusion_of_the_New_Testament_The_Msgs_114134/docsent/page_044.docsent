   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b As the Spirit of Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit received by the believers essentially is also the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for the Spirit contains the element of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, the Spirit Himself is life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, with the Spirit of life we have the riches of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life, for these two actually are one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fact that we cannot separate life from the Spirit is indicated by John 6:63, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here the Lord Jesus connects the Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not have the Spirit, we do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But since we have received the Spirit, we have life, the eternal, uncreated life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have pointed out that the Spirit of reality is the reality of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The reality of the divine Trinity is mainly life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Life is the intrinsic essence of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the Spirit is not only the Spirit of reality but also the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit is of life, and life is of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Life is His content, and He is the reality of life, even life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We, the believers in Christ, have received the Spirit as the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>c To Anoint Them</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God anoints the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In particular, the Spirit anoints us with the reality of the divine Trinity as life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second Corinthians 1:21 says, He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ, the anointed One, is full of anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because we have been attached to Him by God, we have been anointed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now the Spirit moves in us, anointing the Triune God into us that His element may become our constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hebrews 1:9b is another verse that indicates that the believers are anointed by the Spirit: Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God s economy Christ has been anointed to accomplish God s plan, and we are Christ s partners in the divine interest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was anointed by God, and now we share with Him in this anointing for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Two verses in 1 John speak of the Spirit s anointing the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First John 2:20 says, You have an anointing from the Holy One, and verse 27 says, The anointing which you received from Him abides in you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to grammar, the word anointing is a gerund, a verbal noun, and as such conveys action.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The anointing is the moving of the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the anointing is the function of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, according to 1 John 2:20-27 the anointing is the personification of the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This all-inclusive Spirit came into us at the time of our regeneration and will abide in us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In His economy, the Triune God reaches us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Triune God comes into our spirit, He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This Spirit, who dwells in our spirit, is now moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This moving of the Spirit whom we have received essentially is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>d To Seal Them</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit also seals the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 2 Corinthians 1:22 Paul tells us that God has sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ephesians 1:13 says, You were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise, and 4:30 says, Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To be sealed with the Holy Spirit is to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Spirit as the seal of God upon us bears the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This implies that the seal of the Spirit is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God s image signified by the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, when we bear the Holy Spirit as the seal of God, we bear the image of God, His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The seal of the Spirit is not separate from His anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we are under the Spirit s anointing, the anointing becomes a sealing which causes us to bear the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Spirit anoints us, the anointing is the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First, the Spirit through the anointing, adds the essence of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then the anointing seals us with this essence and makes us the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that the anointing brings in the essence, and the sealing produces the image.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>e To Pledge in Them</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In addition to anointing and sealing the believers, the Spirit pledges in them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Second Corinthians 1:22b speaks of the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts, and 5:5 says, He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the pledge of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, Ephesians 1:14 tells us that the Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The pledge of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the pledge, and the pledge is a guarantee that the Triune God is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because God is our inheritance, the Spirit is a pledge of this inheritance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The pledge of the Spirit involves the moving of the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Spirit is not only a pledge guaranteeing our inheritance; He is now pledging within us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means that the pledge of the Spirit is not merely a once-for-all matter, because the Spirit is continually pledging within us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the day we were saved the Spirit began to pledge in us, and this pledging continues day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Furthermore, this pledging of the Spirit involves the dispensing of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As the Spirit pledges in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He dispenses Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Actually, the Spirit s anointing, sealing, and pledging all involve the dispensing of the processed Triune God into our being.</S>
