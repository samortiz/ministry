   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD REACHING US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament assures us that the Word and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in John 20:22, the Lord Jesus breathed upon the disciples and said, Receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the beginning of the Gospel of John, Christ is the Word, but at the end of this Gospel, He breathes out the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 6:63 He says that the Word is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through the Word and the Spirit God reaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If God were not the Word and the Spirit, He could not reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit is God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we touch the Lord or the Lord touches us, we experience a divine reaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God reaches us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, according to the concept of some Christians, the Spirit is simply a means used by God to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No, the Spirit is God Himself reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may use the flow of electricity as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is like the electricity, and the Spirit is like the electric current.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Surely it is wrong to say that electric current is different from electricity itself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When electricity flows, it becomes the current.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the current of electricity is electricity itself in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the current reaches us, it is still electricity, not something apart from electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, some Christians insist that when the Spirit comes to us, God the Father is left on the throne in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No, when the Spirit reaches us, that is God Himself reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE ANTENNA AND THE GROUND WIRE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit is mysterious, abstract, and difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But along with the Spirit, we have the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once again using electricity as an example, we may speak of the antenna and the ground wire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit can be compared to the antenna, and the Word, to the ground wire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the antenna and the ground wire we experience the transmission of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have the Spirit without the Word or the Word without the Spirit, we shall not be able to receive the divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both the Spirit and the Word, both the antenna and the ground wire, are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>TWO EXTREMES</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Among Christians today, Fundamentalists represent one extreme and Pentecostalists another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Fundamentalists care for the Word, but often neglect the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is one extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand, many Pentecostalists care for the Spirit, but neglect the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is another extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not be at either extreme, but should be balanced, caring both for the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Within, we have the Spirit, and in our hands we have the Word, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>RECEIVING THE WORD BY MEANS OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Ephesians 6:17 and 18 Paul tells us to receive the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here Paul covers the aspects both of the Word and of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, he tells us to receive the Word of God by means of all prayer, praying at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may receive the Word of God by means of all kinds of prayer: audible prayer and silent prayer, long prayer and short prayer, quick prayer and slow prayer, private prayer and public prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To take the Word of God by means of prayer is to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we come to the Word of God, we should not merely exercise our eyes to read or our mind to understand, but also exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I can testify from experience that if we touch the Bible without prayer, using only our eyes and our mind, the Bible will be dead letters to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our reading of the Bible should be mingled with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, in pray-reading Genesis 1:1, we may say, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the beginning, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thank You, Lord, in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Oh, God was there in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thank You, Lord, that You are the beginning, the origin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we pray-read the Word in such a way, the Word becomes to us the living breath of God, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a result, we are watered, nourished, refreshed, and enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Far from being a book of dead letters, the Bible becomes in our experience the nourishing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Ephesians 6:17 and 18 Paul definitely charges us to receive the Word of God by means of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some who oppose the practice of pray-reading insist that these verses cannot be applied this way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, according to the Greek text, we must say that we should receive the Word of God either by means of prayer or through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here Paul tells us to receive the Word of God and also gives us the way to receive it by means of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, we cannot deny that in the Bible there is such a thing as pray-reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to read the Word and receive it by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Throughout the centuries many saints have practiced this in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some have said that we need to pray when we read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Others have pointed out that we should read the Bible prayerfully.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To read the Bible prayerfully is to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many of the Lord s people have practiced pray-reading without knowing this term.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Spontaneously in coming to the Word they have prayed with the Word and over the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I believe that before you heard of pray-reading, you may have pray-read John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You may have read the words, God so loved the world, and then prayed, O God, thank You for loving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Father, I thank You that You loved me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You even loved me to such an extent that You gave Your Son for me.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we pray-read the Word, we exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As saved and regenerated ones, we have the Spirit of God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, when we exercise our spirit in pray-reading the Word, we apply the Word to us and mingle the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Immediately, we receive the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>THE PRESCRIPTION AND THE DOSE</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Bible reveals that Christ is God and also the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>One day, Christ became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>During His years on earth, He lived the highest human life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Through His crucifixion and resurrection, His humanity was uplifted and brought into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After living a marvelous and perfect life on earth, the Lord Jesus went to the cross and died there for our sins, accomplishing a full, complete, and perfect redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>On the third day, He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In His ascension He was glorified, crowned, and enthroned; He received the headship, the lordship, and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In addition to these crucial matters, the Bible also reveals that Christ in His resurrection became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Now this life-giving Spirit indwells our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The life-giving Spirit contains Christ s divinity, His uplifted resurrected humanity, His perfect human living which was the expression of God, the effectiveness of His all-inclusive death for the accomplishment of redemption, the power of His resurrection which imparts into us the divine life and nature and Christ s uplifted human nature, and His ascension with His headship, lordship, and kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>All these are elements of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, if we did not have the Bible, we would not know about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We would not know what ingredients are contained in this all-inclusive dose.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Oh, what marvelous riches constitute the bountiful supply of the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We may apply the riches in the bountiful supply to all our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Praise the Lord that we have the Spirit and the Word!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>As we have pointed out repeatedly, the Spirit and the Word are one.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Word is the prescription, and the Spirit is the application.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Through reading the Word we know what we are receiving in the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Through the Word we realize that we receive Christ s divinity, humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Furthermore, we understand that we are one with Christ in His headship, lordship, and kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>All these elements are included in the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>All are aspects of the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Hallelujah, we may now live Christ by receiving the Word through the Spirit!</S>
