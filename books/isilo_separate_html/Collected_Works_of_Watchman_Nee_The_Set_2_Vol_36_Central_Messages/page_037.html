We need to see this in an inward way. This is not something that flesh and blood can reveal to us. Blood is related to our soul, while the flesh is related to our body. The soul and the body cannot help us to know the One God has appointed. When the Lord was on earth, countless numbers of people saw Him, but most did not know Him. Countless numbers of people followed Him, but most did not know Him. Countless numbers of people thronged His side or received His healing, but they still did not know Him. Man's mind and feelings are completely useless in this respect.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "Blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to perceive the things that you see, and have not perceived them, and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them" (Matt. 13:16-17). Indeed, the Lord's disciples were blessed. But this was not enough to make them members of the church; this was not enough to make them a part of the church. Peter had the blessing that the Lord was speaking of because he had seen what the prophets and righteous men had not perceived and heard what they had not heard. However, this was not enough. Only when Peter confessed the Lord as the Christ and the Son of God did he touch the central issue. Only then did Peter's knowledge of the Lord change. In the past his knowledge of the Lord was outward, but now his knowledge of the Lord came from the revelation of the Father who is in the heavens. The Father who is in the heavens made known to him that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Son of the living God. This knowledge is a spiritual revelation. The knowledge that Peter had was inward rather than outward.</p><p>If a man does not have the knowledge that Peter had, he cannot be a part of the church, no matter how many years he has stayed with Christians. Even if he has seen Christ appearing in the flesh, he still cannot be a part of the church. In order to be a part of the church, a man must receive the same revelation that Peter received from the Father. When a man receives instructions from heaven to know that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God and the Christ of God, he becomes a part of the church. Therefore, we need to remember that the church is not only built upon Christ, but upon the Christ whom God has revealed. Without revelation, a man cannot know Christ or the Son of God. This knowledge cannot be gained by learning doctrines or by reading many books that say this and that about the Lord Jesus, and then repeating them. The revelation that we are speaking of is revealed and taught by the Father. The Lord Jesus once said to the disciples, "No one knows who the Son is except the Father" (Luke 10:22). What a wonderful word! If we were the disciples, we might have said, "What do You mean that we do not know You? We know where You were born. We know who Your father and mother are, and we know Your brothers and sisters. We also know Your cousin John. We not only know Your family, but we know Elizabeth and Zachariah." But the Lord Jesus said, "No one knows who the Son is except the Father." When the Lord says no one knows, He means no one knows. No one knows the Son except the Father. In Matthew 16, the Father was revealing the Son whom He knew to Peter so that Peter would know Him too.</p><p>One kind of knowledge of the Lord comes from man's revelation. According to the Lord Jesus, this kind of revelation cannot be considered real knowledge. The only real knowledge is the knowledge which God has concerning the Lord Jesus, and only God can reveal this knowledge to man. Therefore, anyone who has not received the Father's revelation does not know the Son. No one can come to the Father except through the Son, and no one can know the Son except through the revelation of the Father. This kind of revelation from heaven is indispensable. The church is built upon this revelation when it knows this man&mdash;Jesus&mdash;inwardly as the Christ and the Son of God. This inward knowledge is the foundation of the church. If a man does not have this kind of knowledge, yet tries to speak about this and that concerning the church, it is like cooking with a pan that has no bottom or drawing water with a bucket that has no bottom; the result is nothing but vanity. A man's knowledge of Christ does not come from man's teaching, but from the revelation of the Father who is in the heavens. The Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it." The church is built upon this rock for the purpose of closing the gates of Hades. We must emphasize again and again that the knowledge of Christ we conjure up in our mind will not stand the tests; it is powerless and useless. If we come up with an idea of Christ in our head, a tranquil environment may not expose the superficiality of the knowledge, but the minute the gates of Hades open, our knowledge concerning Christ will prove untrustworthy and will be proven to be something other than God's revelation. It will not stand.</p><p>Peter knew the Lord Jesus, and he was tested. Did he fail? Yes, he failed. For a few minutes he denied the Lord, then he remembered His word after He turned toward him, and he wept. Although he failed and although he stumbled, he had the inward knowledge. This knowledge was precious; it led Peter to tears immediately after he fell. The church is resilient because its knowledge of Christ comes from the revelation of the Father who is in the heavens and not from man. It is wrong to think that as long as a person is smart, he can come up with an idea of Christ, or that as long as a person is eloquent, he can speak to others about Him. The knowledge of Christ that man produces by his own wisdom and ability is not a rock; it will tumble at the slightest push.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
