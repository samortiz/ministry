   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although man has problems with God and needs to be reconciled to Him, he has given no thought to this matter nor could he devise a way to be reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But God, who has never had a problem with man and does not need to be reconciled to man, wants man to be reconciled to Him.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the Lord did not accomplish propitiation for our sins, God could not reconcile us to Himself; even if we were to turn to Him, He could not accept us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the Lord s redemption solved every problem and removed every barrier between us and God so that we might return and be reconciled to Him and He might receive us gladly.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through the Lord Jesus and His redemption, God reconciled not only man but all things to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This can be compared to a divorced wife who is also reconciled to her children when she is reconciled to her husband, their father.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God reconciled man and creation, both of which were at odds with Him, to Himself through the cross of the Lord Jesus.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ accomplished all that was necessary to reconcile man to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God, therefore, reconciles man to Himself in Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The ministry of reconciliation ; We beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God 2 Cor 5:18, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To reconcile man to Himself, God not only accomplished all the requirements of reconciliation through the Lord Jesus but He also ministers reconciliation through the Holy Spirit; that is, He moves His ministers by the Holy Spirit to beseech man to be reconciled to Him, and simultaneously, He does the same thing in man.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What earnestness!</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Upon believing, we receive God s forgiveness and justification, and then we are reconciled to Him.</S>
