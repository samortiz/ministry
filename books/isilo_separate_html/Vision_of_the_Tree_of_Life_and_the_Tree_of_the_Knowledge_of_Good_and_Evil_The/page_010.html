TO BRING MAN INTO LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible contains a record of the evil side of Satan as well as the good side of Satan. In the Old Testament the books of history contain accounts related to the side of evil, and the books of poetry contain accounts related to the side of good. God has been working throughout the ages to tear down the good and the evil in man in order to bring man into life.</p>
<p>The books of history record that Cain killed Abel his brother (Gen. 4:8), that Lamech took multiple wives (v. 19), that the earth was filled with violence in the age of Noah (6:11), that the fornications of Sodom and Gomorrah were filthy to the uttermost (18:20; 19:1-9), and that the generations of the children of Israel were corrupt and committed sins and evil continually. These portions speak of the evil side of the tree of knowledge. The Old Testament books of history portray a clear and vivid picture of the evils of Satan and the extent to which he caused man trouble. These books fully portray the evil side of the tree of knowledge.</p>
<p>According to the books of history, there was a minority who were delivered from the evil of the tree of knowledge and lived by the tree of life. Abel was one of these. He was not a doer of good; he was one who contacted God (Gen. 4:4). Enoch was also such a one. The Bible says that Enoch walked with God (5:22, 24). To walk with God is to contact the tree of life, for God is the tree of life. Noah also walked with God (6:9). Abraham built an altar and called upon the name of Jehovah (12:7-8). These ones contacted God. Isaac also built an altar and called on the name of Jehovah (26:25), and Jacob did the same. Jacob was not a good person, but Jacob contacted God, the tree of life (28:18-22). The children of Israel, Jacob&rsquo;s descendants, were as evil as the worldly people, but God gave them to eat the Passover lamb, unleavened bread (Exo. 12), and manna out of heaven (16:14-15, 31-32, 35), which are on the line of the tree of life.</p>
<p>In the books of history the majority of people took the evil path of the tree of knowledge, but a minority took another way. These ones contacted God, touched God, walked with God, and called upon God&rsquo;s name. These ones were on the path of the tree of life. The path of the tree of knowledge and the path of the tree of life are the two paths in the books of history.</p>
<p>After the books of history are the books of poetry. The books of poetry speak of the good aspect of the tree of knowledge. Job feared God and turned away from evil, but he was in the good aspect of the tree of knowledge. Most of the psalmists were also in this good aspect; they had the concept of keeping God&rsquo;s law. This desire to keep the law shows that Satan perverted the intention of the law that God gave on Mount Sinai. This is a profound matter.</p>
<p>From the time the children of Israel ate the Passover lamb in Egypt to when they defeated the Amalekites in the wilderness, built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi (Exo. 17:15), God did everything. God gave them lambs, unleavened bread, manna, and living water out of the cleft rock (12:8; 16:14-15, 31-32; 17:6). When they encountered bitter waters, God made the waters sweet; they experienced Jehovah-rapha, which means &ldquo;Jehovah your Healer&rdquo; (15:22-26). When they had enemies, they experienced Jehovah-nissi, which means &ldquo;Jehovah fought for me.&rdquo; These experiences belong to the tree of life; they are not a matter of conduct. God did not tell the children of Israel what to do or what not to do; He did not tell them how to conduct themselves. Everything He gave to the children of Israel was for their enjoyment. The flesh of the lamb was for them to eat, unleavened bread was for them to eat, manna was for them to eat, and living water was for them to drink. When they were sick, He healed them. When they had enemies, He fought for them. These are the experiences in Exodus 12 through 17, and they are of the tree of life.</p>
<p>One day the children of Israel were influenced by Satan to lean toward the good side of the tree of knowledge. When they said to Moses, &ldquo;All that Jehovah has spoken we will do&rdquo; (19:8), the law was given to expose their inability to do good (ch. 20). Therefore, trying to keep the law is not of life but of good and evil; it belongs to the tree of knowledge. The holy people who wrote the psalms had the law as their background, and they were focused on the good side of the tree of knowledge. They thought that God would be pleased with their doing good and fearing Him (Psa. 1:1-2, 6; 119:1-3). They did not know that their doing good belonged to the tree of knowledge, which God does not want.</p>
<p>In both Job and the Psalms God comes in to tear down again and again. He wants to tear down man&rsquo;s good conduct. Job is a classic example. The result of God&rsquo;s tearing down is that man touches God, meets God, and enters into God. Job said, &ldquo;I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You; / Therefore I abhor myself&rdquo; (Job 42:5-6). This principle also occurs in Psalms. God&rsquo;s tearing down and breaking are for the holy people who wrote the psalms to come out of good and to contact God directly. The psalmists had the concept of the law, but God wanted them to see Him in Christ as their life, light, power, and everything (27:1; 36:9).</p>
<p>The Old Testament books of history are about two groups of people. One group of people developed on the evil side of the tree of knowledge and were judged by God. The other group of people were led by God and learned to contact God and live by the tree of life. The books of poetry show a group of holy God-fearing people who, because of ignorance, developed on the good side of the tree of knowledge. We dare not say that these people were judged by God, but God broke down and tore down what they developed and achieved on the good side of the tree of knowledge. This forced them to contact Him, that is, to contact the tree of life.</p>
<p>Hence, God was not boasting in Job, nor was He praising Job. God seemed to tell Satan that He would even tear down a person who developed on the good side of the tree of knowledge and that He would use Satan to do it. This is a profound matter. Eventually, God forced the God-fearing Job to turn away from good and evil and to touch the tree of life, that is, to touch God Himself.</p>
<p>The books of history are mainly a record of the evil side of the tree of knowledge, and the books of poetry are mainly a record of the good side of the tree of knowledge. However, both sides speak of the development of the tree of knowledge. God judges the evil side, and He tears down the good side. God wants neither evil nor good. God wants life. Life is God to be contacted and enjoyed by man.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
