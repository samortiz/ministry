   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE PRESENTING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE CHURCH 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will continue to look at the practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous chapter we saw the degraded situation in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although there are good things in Christianity, in relation to the ground of the church it has deviated from God s original intention.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation 17 says that even though there are some good things in Babylon, it is filled with unclean things vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 4 says that the woman has in her hand a golden cup full of abominations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Gold signifies God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that there are good things in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the golden cup is full of abominations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a situation of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot say that there is nothing good in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, Christianity has deviated from God s original intention and thus has brought in division and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians 3:3-4 repudiates division.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, Galatians 5:19-21 speaks of the works of the flesh, one of which is sects.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sects is listed among the negative sins; it is even listed with idolatry, sorcery, and enmities.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the Lord s Word shows that division is condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we speak with believers concerning the church, we need to show them pertinent portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should speak according to the revelation in the Word of God, not according to our view.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE GROUND OF ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been commissioned by the Lord to bear the testimony of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This testimony of oneness is the most important matter in the Lord s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ephesians 4:3 speaks of keeping the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The oneness of the Spirit is based on seven items found in verses 4 through 6: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These seven items can be formed into three groups.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first group is one Body, one Spirit, and one hope.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit is the essence of the Body, and through the Spirit the Body is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the Body is the expression of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through the Spirit s regenerating, saturating, and filling, we have the hope of being in the likeness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second group is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through one faith and one baptism, we are joined to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third group is one God and Father, who is the Originator and source of all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The oneness of the Spirit in these verses is based on the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Father is the Originator of the Body, the Son is the Creator of the Body, and the Spirit is the Executor of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BEING DILIGENT TO ARRIVE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AT THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 13 says, Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even though we are in the oneness of the Spirit, we still need to arrive at the oneness of the faith in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By virtue of our believing into the Lord and entering into Him, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are one with all the believers in the Lord, whether they are in Protestantism or Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, in addition to the oneness of the Spirit, we need to be one in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is what it means to arrive at the oneness of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as we are children of God, we have the same faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The faith does not refer to doctrine, neither does it refer to practices.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The faith is related to our salvation, and it includes the person and work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The addition of other items to the faith, such as a special view concerning head covering or a special explanation about speaking in tongues, makes it impossible for the children of God to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord has commissioned us to drop all the other items so that we may arrive at the oneness of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>HOLDING TO THE LORD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>AND STANDING ON THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Based on the ground of oneness, we have the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The New Testament shows that the church is expressed on earth locality by locality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Acts 8:1 speaks of the church in Jerusalem, 13:1 speaks of the church in Antioch, and 1 Corinthians 1:2 speaks of the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These churches are all local.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Revelation 1:11 says that what John saw would be written in a scroll and sent to the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It then lists seven localities.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The letters were for the seven churches, but they were addressed to seven localities.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This clearly shows that the seven localities are equivalent to the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, Acts 14:23 speaks of appointing elders in every church, and Titus 1:5 speaks of appointing elders in every city.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we put these two verses together, we see that appointing elders in every city is the same as appointing elders in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the above verses are basic and can be used to explain the ground of oneness and the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should hold on to these expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even if the whole world rises up to oppose us, as long as we stand on the Lord s Word, we are standing on the truth.</S>
