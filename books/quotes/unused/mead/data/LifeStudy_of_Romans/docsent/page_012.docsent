   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Out of Faith to Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel out of faith and to faith 1:17 , meaning that as long as we have the faith, we have the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The righteousness of God comes out of our faith and to our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not say that you have no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as you call on the name of the Lord Jesus, He is rich to you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you call, O Lord Jesus, He is your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps you will say you have no feeling that you believe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In response to this, I will tell you what happened to me over 40 years ago when I read a book about the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This book said strongly that as long as we believe we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Immediately I asked myself, Have you believed?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I began to doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For some days I was bothered about this and I was unable to eat and sleep well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I did not have the feeling that I believed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After I had been troubled for days, the Lord was merciful to me and helped me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord said, Stupid man, approach this question from another angle and ask yourself, Do you not believe?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Try your best not to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I tried not to believe in Jesus, but I was unable to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I simply could not stop believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was the proof that I had the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you feel that you have no faith, try to stop believing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as you are unable to cease believing, that proves you have the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all have the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Provided we have this faith, God s righteousness is revealed out of this faith and to this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although you may make every attempt to cast away your faith, you cannot do it because faith has come into you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Within you there is something that the Bible calls the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as you have the faith, you have the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To say that the righteousness of God is revealed does not mean that it had no prior existence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It simply means that, although it had been in existence previously, it had not been revealed or made visible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For anything that can be revealed must exist already.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This righteousness of God is revealed out of faith and to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let me illustrate by holding a lovely calendar before your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This calendar has been in existence for some time, but is just now being revealed to you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How is it revealed?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is revealed out of your sight and to your sight.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you were blind, the calendar could not be revealed to you, for the revelation of the calendar is out of your sight and to your sight.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s righteousness exists and has existed for ages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since we believe in Jesus, we have the faith, and this faith is our spiritual sight.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Out of this faith and to this faith the righteousness of God is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the righteousness of God is revealed out of faith and to faith in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>B. The Just Have Life and Live by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel that the just may have life and live by faith 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Greek word rendered live in this verse means both to live and have life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Chinese version translates it to have life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Young s Concordance also tells us that the Greek word means to live and to have life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This verse is a quotation from Habakkuk 2:4, a verse which has been quoted three times in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is found in Hebrews 10:38 where, according to the context, it means the just shall live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Galatians 3:11 it means the just shall have life by faith because the context of Galatians 3 says that the law cannot give life to people Gal 3:21 , that people can only have life by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, in Galatians 3 it is not a question of living; it is a matter of having life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Romans 1:17 includes both of these meanings to have life and to live.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, we may translate the verse this way, The just shall have life and live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This short sentence is a brief extract of the whole book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The book of Romans has three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first section covers the issue of justification, showing us how to be righteous, how to be just, in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The second section tells us how to have life by being justified unto life 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The way to have death is to be condemned by God; the way to have life is to be justified by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then the third section tells us how to live.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After we have received this life, we need to live it out mainly by practicing the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The last section of Romans, from chapter 12 through the end of chapter 16, deals with our living.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We mainly need to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The local churches are the main part of our living as revealed in chapter 16.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, the entire book of Romans covers three things: being just, having life, and living properly.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We all have been justified and we all have received the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now we are living out this life mainly in the Body, in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the way to live by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The just shall have life and live by faith.</S>
