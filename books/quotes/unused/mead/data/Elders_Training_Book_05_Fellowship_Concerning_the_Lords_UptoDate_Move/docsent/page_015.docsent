   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must now consider the home meetings, the meetings of the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The traditional way for the Christians to meet is to have a gathering, to gather the members of the church or perhaps some unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At least one or two learned speakers will speak, while all the rest sit and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is commonly called the service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a sense we have improved this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At one time, Brother Nee strongly insisted on cancelling the Sunday morning meetings so that the saints could preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, Brother Nee never got through.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To tear down any kind of tradition is hard.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some among us may say, Today almost all the nations are accustomed to having a holiday on Sundays.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the best time to gather the people, either to preach the gospel or to teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the people today are accustomed to gathering together to have a service.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may argue that even the unbelievers like to go to church on Sundays to attend the service, and that we should take advantage of this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a good sense this is quite logical.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, even until now we still could not annul the Sunday morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all have to admit that even today we consider the Sunday morning meeting to be the top meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Recently, due to my study, I became bold, even to revolutionize our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But wherever this news went, some may have considered it to be too much.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They may have considered that to put away the Sunday morning service is to commit suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Brother Nee s book, The Normal Christian Church Life, there is a section on the home meetings pp.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>195-200 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was there under that ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I listened to those messages, and in a good sense I helped in giving those messages.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This had never before been brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Nee tried, but he could not get through.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we were to have divided the total congregation into small groups in the homes, there would just have been an absolute silence in each place.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were too used to the big meetings to go directly into the home gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a bridge between the big congregations and the home meetings, Brother Nee proposed to have a brothers fellowship meeting and a sisters fellowship meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On Saturdays the brothers would come together, and the sisters would come at another time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These meetings were not for teaching or for praying, but for fellowshipping.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We began to practice this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the first two or three weeks Brother Nee said that the best way to have these fellowship meetings was to give testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should learn to speak by testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all could have some testimony, testimonies of our repentance, testimonies of our salvation, or testimonies of our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all took this word and practiced it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For a few weeks we had testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, after all these testimonies were exhausted, we came back again silent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This became a hardship to the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They had to consider what they should do in the meetings, whether to call a hymn or give a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, the report went to Brother Nee that they were not able to have such meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later we came to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By that time we had learned a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I myself had eighteen years of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We dropped some of the things we practiced on the mainland which I had learned were not practical.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We had a new start in Taiwan which was prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Within six years we increased from about four hundred people to forty thousand, a hundredfold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that time we began our meeting and our work in one hall in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After one year, we began to meet in a few halls.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then we found out that simply by using the halls, we could not fulfill our purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we began to have small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church had a number of halls.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Under each hall there were a number of small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This way worked very well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was through those small groups that a great number of people were brought in. After being brought in, they were cared for by the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By 1960 the number of saints in Taipei alone was over twenty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 1961 I left Taipei and stayed in the United States for four years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For the next twenty years I returned to Taipei only once in a while.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Gradually the work in Taiwan with all the churches was in an unnoticeable decline.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They did not drop the small group meetings altogether, but without realizing it, there was an unnoticeable decline.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By 1984 the church in Taipei had twenty-one halls.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, their membership came down from over twenty thousand to at most eleven or twelve thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Among these, about one-third was always present in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only about four thousand people were gathered in twenty-one halls.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They only practiced the large gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Rarely did they have some small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Very few of the saints paid attention to the small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Their burden was mainly to train twenty-one speakers to take care of the twenty-one halls.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In principle, they had gone back to the traditional way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They cared mainly for the large Sunday morning meetings and neglected the fact that after twenty-three years their numbers had decreased from more than twenty thousand to less than twelve thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Around 1980 I began to notice that the work and the churches there were not going up, but were instead going down.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>From 1980 to 1984 I had serious talks with the leading ones there, telling them that they should consider their way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Their present way was not working.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, once we get into something, it is hard for us to get out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Outsiders may have a clear view, but we ourselves may be veiled by what we practice.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the beginning of 1984 I realized that I had to go back to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I could not forget about the work there.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I could not go immediately, though, because of the writing of the notes on the New Testament, the outline, and all the annual trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In October of that year I finished the last of the notes on the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then I said, Now I must go back to Taiwan, and I went.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When I went back, I was frank, faithful, and bold with them, because they were mostly people who were raised up through my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I proposed that they have a revolutionizing change.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>First, the present number of saints was divided into small groups, not more than eight or ten in a group.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They formed three hundred ninety-nine groups.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Secondly, at that time in that church of nearly twelve thousand, with around four thousand meeting in twenty-one halls, there were only less than six elders.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The younger ones were considered to be not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>No more than four or five were brought into the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The elders mentioned the brothers by name, saying they were all not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, I told them that this was the time to change our system and add more elders.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To some extent they realized that their system was wrong and that they needed to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>On that same night over fifty elders were established.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Each of the twenty-one halls had either one, two, or three elders.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Many among them are just a little over thirty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I saw their fathers and their mothers before they were saved, and I saw the fruit of those marriages.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>These young fruit now are elders.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is not easy to change our ways.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Recently, however, in Taipei during one weekend eleven hundred and four were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is good news, but I am also waiting to see another positive aspect that all the saints speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The eleven hundred and four were brought in not by preaching but by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>While I was in Taiwan I told the saints to go out to speak the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is not a preaching in an official way, but rather a speaking in a regular way in the daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I told them to speak the gospel to their friends, colleagues, relatives, neighbors, and everybody.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>These eleven hundred and four newly baptized believers were brought in by just about ten percent of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Only a little over three hundred practiced the speaking of the gospel, yet at that time they were baptizing people every day.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>All of this came about through only one-tenth of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Of course, it would be better if one hundred percent would practice in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Now I am waiting to see if all of them would speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The home meetings are the major burden of this elders training.</S>
