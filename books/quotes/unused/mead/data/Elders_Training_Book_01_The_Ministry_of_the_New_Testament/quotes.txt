[1]  Elders Training, Book 01: The Ministry of the New Testament CONTENTS
[2]  The Oneness of God's Ministry and the Peril to It
[3]  AND THE PERIL TO IT OUR PRAYER FOR THIS TRAINING
[4]  Lord, we need You, and we need You to have mercy upon all of us.
[5]  After much study of the holy Word and after many years of laboring in the Lord s Word, we can see today that God s ministry is to use His chosen vessels to carry out His economy, that is, to fulfill His eternal purpose by dispensing Himself into His chosen people that they may express Him.
[6]  According to the divine principle, although God is able to do everything to carry out His economy and He will do everything for this purpose, He will not carry out His economy by Himself apart from man.
[7]  The principle for God to accomplish His economy must be the same as the principle of incarnation.
[8]  Why is it that there were divisions even from the time while the apostles, including Paul and John, were still here on this earth?
[9]  As those in the Lord s recovery, we must ask ourselves what our realization is of the Lord s ministry to carry out His economy.
[10]  Paul, Peter, and James were all there, and a ministry of another kind was trying to come in. In 1 Timothy 1 Paul charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to take care of one thing: to charge certain ones not to teach differently, which means not to teach according to another ministry vv.
[11]  Paul was carrying out God s New Testament ministry and his ministry followed Peter s ministry, which was an immediate continuation of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Himself.
[12]  It is crucial for us to see what the New Testament ministry is.
[13]  However, we should not consider his ministry a separate, individualistic ministry.
[14]  In God s intention, John s service was simply the beginning of the New Testament ministry, a recommending service that initiated the Lord s ministry.
[15]  He had no consideration about anything other than the Lord s ministry, even no consideration about his life.
[16]  We may say that Paul became weak in Acts 21 and followed the advice of James.
[17]  Some may argue that Paul was not weak, but that he was very strong to keep his word that to the Jews he became a Jew 1 Cor 9:20 .
[18]  We know the Lord did not excuse Paul because on the last day of the vow that Paul had agreed to participate in, He brought the whole thing to an end. Paul had paid the charges for the poor votaries, and with just one more day they could have completed the vow.
[19]  However, his ministry became a problem there, not because of Peter, but simply because there was such a thing as Peter s ministry.
[20]  Allow me to testify something from my experience in working with Brother Watchman Nee.
[21]  When I was with Brother Nee, I never behaved, acted, worked, preached, taught, or spoke in any way that could be taken by the enemy to create trouble.
[22]  Please be clear that what I am saying does not mean that I was one hundred percent in oneness in every doctrine with Brother Nee.
[23]  Through all the Life-studies of the New Testament we have completed during the past ten years, the Lord has laid a basic foundation that will enable us to see something further at this time concerning the ministry of the New Testament.
[24]  There is need of such a solid foundational work to see the ministry of the New Testament in the four Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles of Paul, the Epistles of Peter, the Epistles of John, and finally, the book of Revelation.
[25]  Needless to say, we should neither despise nor even neglect John s ministry since it was a very solid initiation of the New Testament ministry.
[26]  After the Holy Spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus, He was the qualified minister of the New Testament ministry.
[27]  John was qualified, but in comparison with the Lord Jesus, John was not so thoroughly qualified.
[28]  While this slave was serving to take care of God s household in this way, according to the Gospel of Luke, He was a genuine, perfect, and entire Man to seek and to save the lost sinners in the way of the highest standard of morality.
[29]  On the positive side, through the death of the Lord Jesus, the divine life was released.
[30]  In carrying out God s New Testament ministry, the Lord Jesus told us that He never did anything out of Himself John 5:19 , He did not do His own work John 4:34; 17:4 , He did not speak His own word John 14:10, 24 , He did everything not by His own will John 5:30 , and He did not seek His own glory John 7:18 .
[31]  That was only a beginning, and the beginning of such a ministry was the termination of all the old things.
[32]  We all have seen that Christ was One who was born of God and born with God to be a God-man.
[33]  According to the basic principle, we all need to understand that the Son never did anything apart from the Father John 5:19 .
[34]  Therefore, when the Son as the last Adam was going through the process of becoming the life-giving Spirit, He did not leave the Father on the throne and go through that process by Himself without the Father.
[35]  The Lord came not only with the life-giving Spirit but as the life-giving Spirit, as the all-inclusive, ultimate consummation of the Triune God, to do one thing to breathe Himself into the disciples.
[36]  The mention of the church in the Gospels indicated that the ministry of Jesus would lead to the producing of the church, and Peter indicated the same thing when he said that God had raised up and exalted the very One whom they had rejected to the throne, and that this One had become the cornerstone of God s building for the church to be built up.
[37]  Therefore, in the sixteen chapters from chapter thirteen to chapter twenty-eight of Acts, Paul repeated the ministry of John the Baptist, of Jesus, and of Peter in a number of messages that he gave, but there was also something further in his part of the New Testament ministry.
[38]  In Paul s time, in his part of the ministry, there were three problems: the problem of the Gentile churches, the problem of handling the relationship between the Gentile churches and the Jewish churches, and the problem of the so-called co-workers.
[39]  None of these problems were there in the section of Peter s ministry.
[40]  We may think it would have been wonderful if the Lord had sent Peter to confirm Paul, but instead the Lord sent a brother who is mentioned in the Bible only in connection with this one thing Acts 9:10-17; 22:12-16 .
[41]  You may say that Paul ministered in another way after that time, but at the very least you must admit that the first part of his ministry was ended by his mistake.
[42]  We all need to be deeply impressed with the significance of Acts 21 even such a strong apostle as the apostle Paul, one with a clear view of God s economy, was not that strong in facing the problem in Jerusalem and not that accurate in his action in that kind of situation.
[43]  It is not the purpose of the New Testament ministry to carry out anything other than the incarnation of the Triune God, His human living, His all-inclusive terminating death, His germinating resurrection, and His exalting ascension to replace God s chosen people with such a One so that the members of Christ could be produced to form a Body as the expression of the Triune God.
[44]  After many years of study in this line, I can tell you that Paul s part of the ministry of the New Testament is altogether not different from the part of the Lord Jesus.
[45]  Here we have some of the elements, some of the intrinsic essences, in Paul s part of the New Testament ministry.
[46]  Rather, you need to develop the knowledge concerning Christ being the Son of God and the One out of the seed of David according to the flesh, and you need to give messages on these matters.
[47]  Of course, I would be deeply troubled if any of you would pick up some peculiar point, some strange thought, thus clouding a message to distract people from the central line, even from the focus of God s New Testament ministry.
[48]  THE HUMAN LIVING OF CHRIST AS REVEALED BY PAUL
[49]  Suppose you have already taken this way to study the incarnation of Christ in the writings of Paul; you have already spent time to pick up all the verses related to this point, and have put them together with much prayer.
[50]  The second point for your study is the human life of Christ in Paul s books.
[51]  If you study in this way, when someone brings up the matter of the human life of Christ, you will immediately have a good collection of all the points in Paul s books.
[52]  It would not be so easy for us to understand that the life portrayed in the Gospel of Mark is the living of a slave without Paul s word in Philippians 2 telling us that the human living of Christ is the living of a slave.
[53]  In addition, in Brother Nee s time the Lord showed us that Christ is the Spirit, but it was not until after we went to Taiwan that the Lord pointed out to us that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.
[54]  Nevertheless, by the Lord s mercy, after I contacted Brother Nee, I began to see that God s way is not in typology, nor in prophecy, nor in biblical dispensations, but in Christ as the Spirit and as life for the church.
[55]  I would have missed the Lord s way and His rich blessing in His own way, and my teaching would not have been a part of God s New Testament ministry.
[56]  From the day I began the work in Taiwan, I had no intention to stir up the people s interest and no intention to gather a crowd.
[57]  I am not narrow, and I am not demanding, but I do mean business in the Lord s work.
[58]  My burden in beginning the work there was simply to carry out God s New Testament ministry.
[59]  In Paul s writings we can see Christ s incarnation, Christ s human living, His death, His resurrection, His ascension, and, in addition, how He as such a One became the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.
[60]  In addition, in your study of the church and the very contents of the church, eventually you will realize that the content of the constitution of the church is actually of three aspects of one source.
[61]  We have traced the New Testament ministry from its initiation with John the Baptist through its foundation and its major part with the Lord Jesus Himself and on to its continuation and further development with the apostle Paul.
[62]  In this chapter we come to Peter s part in the New Testament ministry from his two Epistles and to John s part from his Epistles and from the book of Revelation, which is the consummation of the entire Bible.
[63]  The first few verses of the first chapter of 2 Peter tell us that God has given us all the things relating to life.
[64]  We may say that regeneration brings in the richest deposit, for through regeneration God has deposited into us a full supply of His riches of life to be what we may call our capital.
[65]  Because God has already given us all the things concerning life, what we need now is to develop what we have received, not to receive these things again.
[66]  Paul s ministry is on Christ and the church, which is constituted of Christ, of the Spirit, and of life, that the church might be the expression of the Triune God.
[67]  In John s last book, we come to a threefold consummation the consummation of John s writings, the consummation of the New Testament, and even the consummation of the entire Bible.
[68]  As a part of God s New Testament ministry, this book has never been opened up so much as it has been since 1969, which was the time the Lord showed us the seven Spirits.
[69]  Furthermore, the book of Revelation uses the developed Trinity for the fullest unveiling of the church.
[70]  Eventually, when God has finished dealing with His enemy, the church will come into its fullest consummation in the new heaven and the new earth the New Jerusalem.
[71]  In the lampstand you can see the embodiment of the Triune God but not all the riches detailed in the Triune God applied to His church.
[72]  There the Triune God is flowing as the water of life, and the very embodiment of the Triune God, Christ as the Lamb, is the tree of life growing along the flowing river of life 22:1-2 .
