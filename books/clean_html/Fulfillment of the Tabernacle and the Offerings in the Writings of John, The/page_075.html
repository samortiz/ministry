<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 7:1-32, 37-52</h1><p>In this message we come to chapter seven of the Gospel of John. Like all the other chapters of this Gospel, this chapter is very profound. But although it is profound, it is written in a human way.<h2 class=head1>THE YEARS OF THE LORD’S MINISTRY</h2><p>We have pointed out that the Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. This is seen by the fact that this Gospel has much to say concerning the Jewish feasts. John 2:13 says, “And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.” This was the first feast of the Passover that took place during the years of the Lord’s ministry.<p>The ministry of the Lord Jesus lasted three and a half years. The Passover is held in the first month of the Jewish calendar year, the month of Abib. The Lord Jesus was crucified on the Passover. According to Exodus 12, the Lord said to Moses concerning the month of Abib, “This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you” (v. 2). When the children of Israel observed the Passover for the first time, the Lord commanded them to regard that month as the beginning of a new year. Actually, that was not merely the beginning of a new year; it was the beginning of their history. In addition to the Passover, the children of Israel were to have six other annual feasts: the feasts of unleavened bread, firstfruit, weeks (Pentecost), trumpets, atonement, and tabernacles. These are the feasts which, according to the book of Leviticus, were to be held by the Jews throughout the centuries. John’s record concerning the Lord’s ministry was written according to the sequence of these feasts.<p>The last of the feasts mentioned in relation to the Lord’s life on earth was the Passover. At the time of the Passover, He was betrayed, judged, and crucified. It is helpful to realize that, according to the Jewish way of reckoning time, a new day begins in the evening. Thus, a day is counted as beginning not in the morning, but in the evening. The Lord Jesus was betrayed and judged during the night of His last day. Then in the morning, at nine o’clock, He was crucified, and He was on the cross for six hours, until three o’clock in the afternoon.<p>From the Passover on which the Lord was crucified back to the Passover in chapter six of the Gospel of John is a period of one year. This was the last year of the Lord’s life on earth. From the Passover in John 6 back to the feast of Purim in chapter five is approximately another year in the Lord’s ministry. Then from the feast of Purim in chapter five back to the Passover feast in chapter two is yet another year. Before this Passover in John 2, the Lord had already been ministering for some months. This is the reason Bible students have calculated that the Lord’s ministry lasted for three and a half years.<p>Everything from verse 13 of chapter two through chapter four of the Gospel of John took place within the period of one year. As we have seen, in John 5 the feast of Purim is mentioned. This feast is held in the last month of the Jewish calendar year. In John’s record, there is no mention of anything that happened during the year between the feast of Purim in chapter five and the feast of the Passover in chapter six. The first Passover in John is in chapter two; the second is in chapter six; and the third is in chapter twelve. Between the Passover in chapter two and the feast of Purim in chapter five is one year. Between the feast of Purim in chapter five and the Passover in chapter six is another year. Then between the Passover in chapter six and that in chapter twelve is yet another year.<p>In the second part of chapter one we have a preliminary record regarding the Lord’s ministry. In this record we are told about John the Baptist. When John saw Jesus coming to him, he said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (1:29). John also testified and said, “I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him” (v. 32). In this chapter we also read of the Lord’s contact with certain ones who became His disciples. Furthermore, as we have pointed out, the preliminary record in John 1, an introduction to the entire Gospel, contains six important signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. What is recorded in John 1 is a prologue, an introduction, to the following chapters. Then in the first part of chapter two the Lord changed water into wine (2:1-11). This was the beginning of signs and signifies life’s principle—changing death into life.<p>In the second part of chapter two a new year begins that covers chapters three and four. This year ends with the feast of Purim in chapter five. Thus, we have the Passover in the first month of this year, and the feast of Purim in the twelfth month of the year.<p>Let us now consider what happened during the first year of the Lord’s ministry according to the record in the Gospel of John. Following the sign of the changing of water into wine (2:1-11), at the beginning of the first year of the Lord’s ministry we see in 2:12-22 life’s purpose—building the house of God. These verses speak of Christ’s cleansing of the temple and also of the body of Jesus, the temple, being destroyed and raised up in resurrection. Therefore, in chapter two we have the principle of life and the purpose of life. The principle of life is to change death into life, and the purpose of life is to build the house of God.
