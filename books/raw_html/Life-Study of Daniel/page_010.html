NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S MARVELOUS DREAM</H2><P>Nebuchadnezzar had a marvelous dream of a great human image (2:1). That dream should have impressed him deeply, but he forgot the dream because he did not have a heart for God's interest. Then his spirit was troubled to know the dream, and all the magicians, all the wise men of Babylon, and the Chaldeans were unable to tell him the dream (vv. 2-13). However, there was a man, Daniel, who set his heart on the spiritual things regarding God's interest on earth. He did not have the dream, yet he received the vision from God concerning it (vv. 17-23) and interpreted it (vv. 24-45).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. DANIEL'S VISION FROM GOD<br>CONCERNING NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S DREAM</H2><P>In 2:14-45 we have Daniel's vision from God concerning Nebuchadnezzar's dream.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God's Vision Given to Daniel</H2><P>Verses 17 through 23 speak of God's vision being given to Daniel.</P>
