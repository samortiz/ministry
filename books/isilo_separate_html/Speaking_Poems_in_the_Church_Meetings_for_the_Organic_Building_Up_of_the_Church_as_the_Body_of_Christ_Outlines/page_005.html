<h1 class="title">SPEAKING POEMS<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16; 1 Tim. 3:16; 1 Cor. 14:15b; Psa. 95:1; 100:1; Rev. 2:6</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="16">
<li>We believe the psalms (long poems), hymns (shorter poems), and spiritual songs (the shortest poems) spoken by the early saints in the meetings when the church came together were not just the old psalms of the Old Testament but even more the new psalms, hymns, and songs that the saints composed according to the teaching of the apostles.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When the saints met together, they used the psalms, hymns, and songs very much.</li>
	<li>First Timothy 3:16 was probably a quotation of a short song that was popular in the apostles&rsquo; time.</li>
	<li>When we speak the proper hymns written according to the teaching of the apostles, we will taste and see the riches of Christ in them.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We should not take the way of the clergy-laity system; rather, we must overthrow this system that produces a hierarchy.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In this system the so-called laymen do not know how to speak; only the clergymen who have studied theology and learned to speak are the ones who speak.</li>
	<li>Everyone can speak in the meetings of the church by speaking the hymns according to what has been presented; we overthrow the clergy-laity system by exercising our spirit to speak (Rev. 2:6).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Although we will speak the spiritual poems to one another in the meetings of the church, we should still sing the psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The New Testament tells us that we should sing&mdash;Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16; 1 Cor. 14:15b.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Both Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 say that when we are filled within, we will be full of grace to sing with our hearts, to speak to one another, and to praise the Lord.</li>
		<li>According to 1 Corinthians 14, we should sing out our feeling in the spirit.</li>
		<li>Our singing should be full of the Lord, full of the spirit, and full of life.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Psalms in the Old Testament tell us to make a joyful noise to the Lord&mdash;Psa. 95:1; 100:1.</li>
	<li>The reasons the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the meetings when the whole church comes together are not that living is because first there is a lack of all speaking and second a lack of singing.</li>
	<li>We may not be an accomplished singer, yet we should still enjoy singing to the Lord.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord enjoys the singing of all the saints.</li>
		<li>The Lord does not care for the proper melody, but He likes to hear a joyful noise full of praises to Him.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we sing in the spirit and with the spirit and with Christ as the content, this is pleasing to God even though we cannot carry a tune; this kind of singing is sweet to the Triune God.</li>
	<li>Whenever we have some free time at home, we should sing the hymns.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should sing the hymns until we know them well.</li>
		<li>In this way it will be easy for us to sing hymns in the meetings.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Singing is an outstanding trait of a Christian.</li>
