        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYING TO THE LORD<br />
AND BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 16:13-15; 7:37-39; Eph. 5:18-20</h1>
<p>Let us look at some verses in the Scriptures related to the Divine Trinity. John 16:13-15 says, &ldquo;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo; According to these verses, all that the Father has is the Lord&rsquo;s, and all that the Lord has is received by the Spirit and declared to us.</p>
<p>Verses 37 through 39 of chapter 7 say, &ldquo;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; These verses say that those who believe into the Lord Jesus will receive the Spirit. This was our experience. When we believed into the Lord Jesus, we received the Spirit.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:18-20 says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father.&rdquo; When we are filled in spirit, we will praise the Lord with singing and psalming in our hearts. Such praises will be rendered by the saints not only individually but also corporately; all the saints will speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. This portion also says that we need to give thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father. These verses reveal the three persons in the Divine Trinity. <em>Spiritual songs</em> in verse 19 implies the Spirit, and verse 20 speaks of the Lord Jesus and of God the Father. If we are filled in spirit, we will praise the Lord with spiritual songs and give thanks to God the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL INTENTION BEING<br />
LIFE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>Many portions of the Bible are like pictures; they depict the profound and mysterious things of God. The picture at the beginning of the Bible is of man being placed in front of the tree of life. The last picture is of a glorious city built with gold, pearl, and precious stones. At the beginning we see a tree, but at the end we see a city. The tree depicts life, and the city depicts building. If we understand the meaning of these pictures, we will realize that God&rsquo;s intention is altogether related to life and building. He intends to be life to His people so that they can be built up together in His life to become a glorious eternal dwelling place.</p>
<p>If we read the Bible in the light of the picture at the beginning of the Bible and the picture at the end of the Bible, we will see that the entire Bible speaks of God being life and everything to His people so that they can be transformed into precious materials and built together in His life to become a corporate entity, which is His glorious dwelling place. The Bible is focused on life and building. Building depends on the divine life, which is a matter of God entering into man to be mingled with man and to be man&rsquo;s supply in every matter.</p>
<p>From the beginning to the end, the Bible shows God&rsquo;s desire to enter into His people to be enjoyed by them as their everything. He is their life, strength, wisdom, way, bread of life, and living water. All these items reveal that God wants to enter into us to be our supply so that we may enjoy Him. The issue of such an enjoyment is not only that we will live because of Him but also that He will be mingled with us and become our constitution, delivering us from everything outside of Him, including our natural self. This is the way that we are built up as a corporate entity to be His eternal dwelling place. This is the central thought of the Bible, and this is God&rsquo;s eternal intention.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING IN CHRIST FOR MAN&rsquo;S ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>How is it possible for us to experience God? God has given Himself to us so that we would experience Him. This is not doctrinal; it is practical. God wants us to touch Him, gain Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him. He wants us to experience Him in every item of our daily life. This is real. However, how is it possible that we can experience our glorious Lord?</p>
<p>The first step God took in His plan was to put everything of Himself in His Son, our glorious Lord Jesus Christ. God is pleased for the Lord Jesus to have the first place in all things (Col. 1:18). God is pleased to give all honor, authority, position, and glory wholly to the Lord Jesus. When believers glorify the Lord Jesus, they glorify God, and when they worship the Lord Jesus, they worship God. Conversely, when people reject the Lord Jesus, they reject God, and when they insult the Lord Jesus, they insult God. The way that a person deals with the Lord Jesus is an indication of his attitude toward God. The Lord Jesus is not only God&rsquo;s grace to man; He is also God&rsquo;s test to man. A person who is willing to receive the Lord Jesus will obtain God&rsquo;s grace, but if he rejects the Lord Jesus, he receives God&rsquo;s test. God is in the Lord Jesus for man to receive and enjoy Him. The way that a person treats the Lord Jesus determines the kind of relationship he has with God.</p>
<p>Hence, we must know the Lord, believe in Him, love Him, pray to Him, give Him praise, revere Him, and regard Him as the Lord of lords and the King of kings. Whenever we exalt Him, bless Him, and worship Him, we touch God&rsquo;s heart. God rejoices when His Son receives our worship, respect, exaltation, and blessing because God&rsquo;s heart is set on His Son. God has given all that He has to His Son, and He wants His Son to have the first place in all things.</p>
<p>We must see this vision: God desires to glorify His Son, and He has put all His fullness and all that He has into His Son. We cannot receive anything of God apart from His Son. In order to obtain God&rsquo;s love, grace, and riches, we must receive the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>All saints experience joy and feel pleasant when they consider the Lord Jesus. The adherents of other religions do not have this kind of sweetness or joy when they consider the founders of their religions. Only Christians have a sense of sweetness, gratitude, and adoration when they remember the Lord Jesus or mention His name. Christians have such feelings because the Spirit is within them glorifying the Lord Jesus. When we remember the Lord Jesus, we worship, thank, and adore Him. This is not doctrine; it is the work of the Spirit within us. This work of the Spirit leads us to the second step in our experience of God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
