   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Baptism Leading to Salvation through Water</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Scripture is consistent in its principles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Peter 3:20 says, "In the days of Noah...a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse shows us again that baptism leads to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus said, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the day of Pentecost, Peter said, "Be baptized...for the forgiveness of your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul's action shows us that when a person is baptized, his sins are washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are not just forgiven, but washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is because our sins are washed away when we sever our relationship with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here, the word in 1 Peter also shows us that we are saved through water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, baptism leads to salvation through water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who cannot pass the test of water are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person who cannot pass through water drowns.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During Noah's time, everyone was baptized, but only eight souls came out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the people were baptized and immersed in the water, but only eight souls emerged from it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, the water became the water of death to some, but to others it was the water of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Others go into the water and remain there, but we pass through the water and emerge from it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is something positive in Peter's word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the flood came, everyone drowned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only the eight souls in the ark, whom the water could not overcome, emerged from it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While the rest perished, these eight souls were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today the whole world is under the wrath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For one to be baptized today means that he goes through God's wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But he does not only go through it; he comes out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His emergence from it shows that he is one who has come out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Baptism is being immersed on one side and emerging out of water on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Baptism means passing through and emerging from the water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must emphasize the aspect of "emergence."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone went into the water, but only the eight souls came out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we are saved through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I am baptized, I do not go into the water and remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, I enter into the water and emerge from it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you have never believed in the Lord Jesus, your baptism will not result in an emergence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today my going into the water and coming out of it means that I am different from you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I can come out from the world through the water.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I testify to others that I am different from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>E. Baptism Freeing Us from the World</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The above four portions of the Scripture clearly show us what baptism is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once we are baptized, we are freed from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not need years to be freed from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first thing for a new believer to do is to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You must see the position of the world before God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You have renounced your former position in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must put off the world completely.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From now on, you are no longer a part of the world; you are on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once we believe in the Lord, we should realize that we are no longer a part of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our baptism is a sign that we are freed from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through baptism we assume a different role.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Henceforth, we abide in the ark and are persons on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can tell others that we do not do certain things because we have believed in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But, even more, we can tell others that we do not do them because we are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have crossed the bridge; we are on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today we must recover the place of baptism before God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What is the meaning of baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Baptism means to come out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is a step which we take to free ourselves from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our baptism is a declaration to others that we are out.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is like the words of a hymn which say, "Then the grave, with dear ones weeping,/Knowing that all life has fled" Hymns, #628 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our dear ones know that we are finished and that we have come to the end of our road.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are through.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only this kind of baptism is effective.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If this is not our realization, our baptism is too light and insubstantial.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must realize that we have been freed from the old circle and have come out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Eternal life is something that our spirit gains before God, but salvation is an act of our separation from the world.</S>
