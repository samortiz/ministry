<h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF THE APOSTLES&rsquo; CHARACTER</h2>
<p>In the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s writings in his Epistles concerning the Lord Jesus, we can actually see the writer himself. Though all of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles concern Christ, they allow us to see Paul. I do not think that the Epistles of Peter need to be designated as such. By reading them one can immediately recognize their writer. The same is true of Paul&rsquo;s writings. We can see the apostles from the epistles they wrote, because it was Christ whom they bore, and it was Christ who lived through them. Moses saw the vision of fire burning on the thorn-bush. All the Epistles by the apostles were written according to this principle. On the one hand, Christ used Paul as His upholder, putting Himself on Paul. On the other hand, Paul lived out Christ. Because of these two points, each time they spoke concerning Christ, the apostles could not avoid being seen.</p>
<p>There are two lines in the Bible. One line concerns the upholding of Christ, and the other, the living out of Christ. To live out Christ is a matter of life, whereas to uphold Christ is a matter of character. With every apostle there are the matters of character and life. With regard to Paul&rsquo;s character, he was used by Christ; he bore Christ, and Christ was upheld by him. As to life, Paul took Christ as his life; he lived in Christ, and Christ lived in him. Thus, when we read the Epistles of Paul, it is not difficult to see that some matters in them are related to character and some to life. For example, Paul said, &ldquo;What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:21); he also said, &ldquo;Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I do not burn?&rdquo; (2 Cor. 11:29), and, &ldquo;But when Cephas came to Antioch I opposed him to his face, because he was to be condemned&rdquo; (Gal. 2:11). These words reflect a certain character. On the other hand, Paul said, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:10), and also, &ldquo;And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:18). These words refer to life. In certain parts of the Epistles of Paul we find his character as a servant of God: strong, responsible, serious, intolerant of errors, honest, willing to rebuke others to their face. In other places we see the very life which he lived. We should not have only life without a proper character; neither can we have only a good character without life.</p>
<p>One day in Manila, during a car ride with some brothers to the countryside, we saw an elegant Catholic cathedral situated on a small hill. The brothers brought me into the place for a visit. When I entered, I saw several nuns dressed in white, kneeling. They were motionless and appeared unreal until I looked carefully. They were so adept in the practice that they did not move even a little. We watched them for a long time before one stood up. We were transfixed as we observed the way she walked. Such serenity and composure would be impossible to imitate. As she went forward to get a Bible, her stride, posture, and movements commanded our utmost respect and admiration. What marvelous conduct! If I had not known the Lord, I would have resolved that day to join Catholicism. I believe that if some unbelievers were to see those nuns and us, they would surely conclude that we Christians are not as respectable as the Catholics. However, those who know Christ would realize that such conduct was not life; it was a developed character at best. A good character devoid of life is of no value. But life without a proper character is equally useless. Regardless of how much we know about Christ, we cannot minister Christ without a proper character.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF CHARACTER<br />
BUILDING FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVICE</h2>
<p>What kind of work are we planning to do? Do we expect to do a work that is valuable and weighty or a work that is shallow? In the Lord&rsquo;s service there is the need not only of the knowledge of the Lord but also of a character that upholds the Lord. The Bible requires that the elders be grave. Is this a matter of character or of life? It is too clear that this is a matter of character and not of life. One person may be clearly saved but still frivolous. Another may oppose the Lord Jesus yet be serious in his character. If these two people were to stand up and speak to a crowd, which one would gain the confidence of the people? It would be the opposer. Why? Because he is sober. We can immediately realize from this illustration that our usefulness in the Lord&rsquo;s hand is based on our character and that it takes our character to minister life. Obviously, without life nothing is ministered, but without a proper character, life still cannot be dispensed.</p>
<p>Admittedly, we are short in life, but I feel strongly that there is a severe, even desperate, lack in our character. For example, according to my observation, some young brothers are totally unlearned in manners. In their contact with people they seem to have no sense of who is older and who is younger. They consider showing respect as shameful and politeness as undemocratic. They care little whether the person in their presence is a school principal or a dean. Be assured that such people are finished; they cannot serve the Lord.</p>
<p>Young brothers, in the dormitory where you live, are you polite toward your schoolmates? Although I did not visit you every day, based on my limited observations, I know how you live. Please forgive me for saying that you do not have the proper character at all. I admit that you may not fight or quarrel; I also dare say that your character has not been built up. To build up your character, you must keep the rules governing which bed you should sleep in, where you should hang your clothes, and where you should store your suitcase. You must abide by the rules of the school. You may think that these are small matters, but if you are not exercised in these things in your daily life, you will be absolutely useless to God. You will lack the character of rule-keeping. You may freely throw your shoes under another&rsquo;s bed and hang your shirt on his bedpost, and his vest may somehow turn up in your area. Believe me, this kind of person can never do a work.</p>
<p>Rule-keeping is on the passive side. Positively, we need to be polite. We should rush to do the unpleasant jobs and let others do the easy ones. This is not life; it is merely the sign of a good character. But if such a character is not built up in us, we cannot hope to serve the Lord properly. If you are not a regulated person, your preaching will likewise be undisciplined. If you are disorderly, what you preach will also be disorganized.</p>
<p>Brothers, in serving the Lord character is no less important than life. Without a proper character, you have no way to do a work. Life is your material and character is your technique. A carpenter cannot make anything without wood; but this does not mean that he can make something as long as there is wood. The saw may be useful in the hand of another but not in yours. The ax is useful to others, but in your hand it only ruins the wood. You do not have a particular character simply because you have never practiced. As a rule, if you are about to go through a door and a younger brother wants to do the same, you should let him go first. If you are carrying a basin and some water happens to spill on your roommate&rsquo;s bed, you must wipe the waterdrops quickly and look for an opportunity to apologize to him. I do not recognize this as life, yet if you desire to serve the Lord, you must be particular about your character. The character within you enables you to be disciplined in your service to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE AND RELATIONSHIP<br />
BETWEEN CHARACTER AND LIFE</h2>
<p>Let me further illustrate the difference between character and life. Consider a sister who loves to gossip, talks a great deal, and is always unhappy with others. Such a condition indicates a shortage in life, not in character. Another sister rarely speaks or becomes angry, because both her tongue and her flesh have received the dealing of the cross. However, she is sloppy in her living and inconveniences those around her. When others murmur, she is not angry and does not blame them. This sister may be excellent in life, but she lacks one thing&mdash;a proper character. This example shows the difference between the aspect of life and the aspect of character.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we must realize that life and character are not independent of each other. Life can influence our character, and on many occasions it can even replace our character. But character cannot affect life or substitute for life. Often the spirituality of a spiritual person becomes his character and replaces his character. This was the case with the Lord Jesus. The character of the Lord Jesus was almost an expression of His life. We may say that the aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s character, as recorded in Mark, were the expression of His life. In other words, much of His life was also His character.</p>
<p>However, we cannot say that character is life, for even an unbeliever has his character. For example, the sobriety of a certain person is part of his character, not his life. The spirituality of a spiritual person, which issues from his abiding in the Lord, can make him sober. The character of a Christian should not merely be character. We should not only display outward sobriety, thoroughness, and consideration for others, with no life inwardly. We must have both life and character. In fact, we should go one step further: our life and our character should be blended as one. Although character does not equal life, life can become a great part of our character. I am polite because I live in Christ; I am also sober because I live in Christ. I can be careful because Christ is my carefulness, and I can be regulated because Christ is my regulation. Life and character have become one in me.</p>
<p>In the beginning the person who loves the Lord often seeks after life. Gradually he realizes that it is his character which limits his dispensing of the Lord to others. Then he changes the way he conducts himself; that is, he begins to develop his character. At first this kind of character building is mostly man-made. As he grows in the Lord and the life in him becomes strengthened, his character is slowly brought into life. Eventually, the life within him is mingled with his outward character. At this point his outward sobriety comes from his inward life. His outward politeness and orderliness are also issues of the life within him. His character is constituted predominantly with the inward element of life. This was true of our Lord when He was on the earth, and it must have been true of Paul. Today, our need before the Lord is to pay attention to the fact that in serving the Lord, without life we have nothing to minister to others. Likewise, if we only have life but lack the proper character, we have no way to minister. In the Lord&rsquo;s service there is the need for life as well as the proper character. Therefore, we must thoroughly build up our character and our human conduct.</p>
