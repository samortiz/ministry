   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. If We Have the Digested Word of God,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We Will Overcome</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"The word of God abides in you and you have overcome the evil one" 1 John 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's Word is His word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we keep God's word in our hearts, when accidents occur or dangers come, the Holy Spirit will cause us to remember one or a few verses of Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These words of Scripture will then become our hiding place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we hide behind these words and believe in the power of these words, the enemy will not be able to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Scriptures which the Holy Spirit brings to mind will increase our strength and boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every word of God is powerful, living, and operative.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we have God's word dwelling in and filling our hearts, Satan will suffer loss and be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>D. We Must Withstand Him by Exercising Our Will</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have a will within us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This will is like our rudder.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we exercise our will to tell Satan, "I will not allow you to come into my heart; I will not give you this right," surely Satan will retreat from us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we must insure that our will is indeed set in this way!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If not, the result will be the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, we have to obey God, and on the other hand, we have to withstand the devil; then the devil will flee from us James 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, if a hawker comes to sell you merchandise and you are determined in your will that you will not buy, your resistance will naturally cause him to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if you bargain with him, you will surely end up buying his merchandise.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians today do not have a resolute will in resisting the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They bargain with him, and of course, the devil ends up selling his cargo.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we withstand the devil, we must exercise our faith 1 Pet 5:9 and speak to Satan with God's power: "In the name of the Lord Jesus who has overcome you, I resist you."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After doing this, we must exercise our faith; reckon that since we have resisted the devil, God, based on His word, will drive him away; and praise God for it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan has fled, and we should be more than conquerors through the Lord who loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Satan tempted the Lord, He did not leave him any ground; He resisted and rebuked him immediately Matt 16:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should be as alive in our awareness as the Lord was, and our word of resistance should be as firm as His.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>E. Calling On God Immediately</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>without Consulting the Devil</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Michael,...when he contended with the devil,...said, The Lord rebuke you" Jude 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many believers are not able to call on God to rebuke Satan the moment he acts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the contrary, they listen to the devil concerning his designs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By then it is too difficult to resist him any further.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The moment Satan opens his mouth, we must call on God to rebuke him, so that he cannot even finish his sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must also believe that God will rebuke him immediately and that Satan will no longer trouble us, despite his putting up a fierce front when he is rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A certain believer once said, "To me, we should allow Satan to finish what he has to say, so that we will know what to answer him."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Wrong!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not have to answer Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should stop him from speaking to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Otherwise, we will be like Eve, who listened to Satan's words and answered him, with the result being many vexations and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not worry that you may lose your friendship with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not worry that you may be too cruel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When he comes, ask the Lord to rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this way, we will always be victorious in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>F. Not Giving Ground to Satan</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even in the Smallest Things</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many times we are careful to guard against Satan's stratagems in the great things, yet we are often not watchful in the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result, we often fail and fall into the devil's deception through one thought or one word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who are faithful in small things are faithful in great things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must be careful not to "give place to the devil" Eph 4:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Give no opportunity to the opposer for reproach" 1 Tim 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If Satan does not have a "factory," he will not be able to manufacture sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we leave some ground for him in our heart, even if only a small patch, he will use it to create sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not neglect the small things just because they are small.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must realize that Satan is able to invade our whole being through these small things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is it to give place to the devil?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is to have 1 unrighteousness, 2 sin, and 3 the fear of him in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It means that we do not have an active will to resist him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the contrary, we are afraid of provoking him through our resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If this ground is not taken from him, the enemy will never be driven away.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This reminds me of a story.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A certain traveler set up his tent in the desert.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A mule, which was outside freezing, asked the man to allow its head to come inside the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After a while, it asked him to allow its neck to come inside the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After a while, it asked him to allow its two feet to come in as well.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Soon, its whole body was inside the tent, and the traveler had no place to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now the mule would not leave, and eventually, the traveler had to leave the tent with the mule inside.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today's Christians are careless about the little things.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As a result, this little leaven leavens the whole lump.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The devil will try to gain an inch in order to gain a foot.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must trust in the Lord's power to destroy the devil's "factory" within us.</S>
