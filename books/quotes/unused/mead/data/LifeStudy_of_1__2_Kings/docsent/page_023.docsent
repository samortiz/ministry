   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Side Chambers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The side chambers signify the unsearchable riches of Christ becoming His extension as His fullness 1 Kings 6:5c .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As believers in Christ, we are the temple and we are also the side chambers, the extension of Christ as His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 In Three Stories</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The side chambers were in three stories, signifying being in the Triune God and in Christ's resurrection v. 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2 Their Widths</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The width of the first story was five cubits; the second, six cubits; and the third, seven cubits v. 6 . This signifies that the higher the church as Christ's fullness goes, the wider it is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>3 Their Door</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The door of the side chambers signifies the communication, the fellowship, of the church as the fullness of Christ v. 8a . The side chambers were separate, but there was a door for communication.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there had been no door, that would have indicated autonomy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today, some local churches either have no doors or they close their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They cut off fellowship between the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The wider the door, the richer the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, all the local churches as chambers of Christ should widen their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>4 The Winding Stairs</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The winding stairs signify that the way to get into the church as the fullness of Christ is spiral without corners v. 8b . This indicates that the fellowship between the churches should not have corners.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, the fellowship should continue to go up and up by a spiral stairway, like the street in the New Jerusalem Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the New Jerusalem, from the mount where God's throne is, a river flows down the street in the form of a spiral to reach all the twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>j.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Its Two Bronze Pillars</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The temple's two bronze pillars signify the Christ judged by God becoming the supporting strength of God's dwelling on the earth 1 Kings 7:15-22 .</S>
