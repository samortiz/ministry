   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE NINETEEN CHRISTIAN LIFE AND ITS SUFFERINGS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:11-20 GOD S DESIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Peter 2:1-10 reveals God s goal; it shows us what God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God wants a built up house and a priesthood for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both the house and the priesthood must be corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is indicated by the four collective nouns used in verse 9: race, priesthood, nation, and people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, God wants a house in which to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we all know, a house cannot be built of a single piece of material.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the contrary, a house can be built only of many different materials put together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In addition to a house for His dwelling, God wants a priesthood for His service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God does not desire individual priests; He desires a priesthood, a corporate body of priests, for His service.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The house and the priesthood, both of which are corporate entities, are for God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is indicated clearly in 2:9: But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Telling out the virtues of Him is a matter of expressing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To tell out the Lord s virtues simply means to express Him according to what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is rich in virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, He is loving and kind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Both His love and His kindness are virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, all of God s attributes are His virtues, and we should tell out these virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever we preach the gospel and teach the truth concerning the Lord, we should tell out His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But unlike the practice of many Christians today, this telling out should be a corporate matter, not an individual one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to turn from traditional, religious teachings and come back to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We grow by taking in the guileless milk of the Word so that we may be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we shall be built up into a house for God s dwelling and a priesthood for His service.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, we shall become God s expression in His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are the main points of the second section of this Epistle, 2:1-10.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1 Peter chapter one we have God s economy to bring forth His full salvation so that we may have His life to have a holy manner of life and to have genuine love for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1:1-2 we see that the pilgrims in dispersion are under the operation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then in 1:3-25 we have the full salvation of the Triune God and its issues.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In chapter two we see the matter of growth in life and its results 2:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First we grow by feeding on the milk of the Word unto full salvation 2:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we are transformed unto the building up of a spiritual house for God s dwelling, a holy priesthood for God s service 2:4-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Following this, in verses 9 and 10, we have the telling out of the virtues of the One who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peter may have been a fisherman, but he was very intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After studying Peter s two Epistles, I have become fully convinced that this fisherman had a scholarly mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, in order to appreciate the beauty of Peter s thought, we need to dig deeply into his writings.</S>
