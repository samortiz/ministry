   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN REPORT ON THE WORK 2 Co-workers' Meeting Date: May 2, 1948, Lord's Day, 3:00 p.m.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speakers: Watchman Nee and Witness Lee ARRANGEMENTS CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE FUTURE OF THE CO-WORKERS Understanding the Meaning</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>of Handing Over Oneself,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>and Having the Reality of It</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Watchman Nee: Last night there was one thing that we did not announce, which is the arrangements concerning the future of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I hope that there is no misunderstanding among us concerning the purpose of handing over ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to see that we are all priests before God 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both Exodus 19 and Romans 12 tell us that everyone is a servant before God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the same time we see that service is not an individual matter, but a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the reason we ask all the brothers and sisters to hand over themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, there should be no need to speak about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Originally, many things could be said directly after a person believed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, due to the captivity of the church into Babylon, degradation came in, and there was the need for a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today the church is indeed the community of saved ones, but it is not yet the community of serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If God's children do not serve, the church will merely become a "club house'' of saved ones, a place where saved ones come together to sing, preach, and meet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is to change the basic nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the church has become fallen, all the brothers and sisters have become free to do whatever they like and to express whatever opinion they have.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, many things have become optional, and some have become lawful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, no one likes to meddle with others' affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, we do not like others to meddle with our affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason some barriers develop among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But God's Word says that the church is the place where men serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the place where God's children work and labor together in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church as seen from God's Word is very different from the church of today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In God's Word every person, matter, and event are for serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the future we have to bring everyone up to this standard.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people who have become Christians do not know what it means to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the future we will not have to tell the saved ones to hand over themselves; by that time, they will not be able to be a Christian if they do not hand themselves over the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a man does not forsake everything, he will not be able to step into the door.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who do not forsake everything to follow the Lord cannot be His disciples Matt 10:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Outwardly speaking, it seems difficult for a man to forsake everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But inwardly speaking, this is something that brings us joy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man must be brought to a point where he is willing to give up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only then will he be able to follow a straight course.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today, when we ask you to consecrate, we have to persuade you to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in the future we will not need to persuade anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man will either drop the world completely, or he will not be able to be baptized at all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Either you come in an absolute way or you do not come.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some people have said that the term "handing over'' is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are not arguing about terminology today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You can call it whatever you like.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What matters is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the past men thought that serving God was a matter of personal choice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They thought that being zealous or not was one's own business, and that serving or not was also one's own business.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But now this is changed around.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If there is the coordination and you are in trouble, other brothers and sisters beside you will not let you fall.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way the church interferes with as well as supports every individual.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people will be watching over you as well as helping you and protecting you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything Done in the Fellowship of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>and for the Benefit of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The brothers and sisters should know that their future, their jobs, occupations, dwellings, businesses, possessions, and everything that forms a part of their living should be put in the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Formerly, one could make decisions on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But now, if he is to take the service of God as his center, everyone has to take one great step forward.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From now on no one can make his own decisions or do things his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many enterprises and occupations do not render much help to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The responsible brothers will ask you to change these occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What we do must be of maximum benefit to the gospel.</S>
