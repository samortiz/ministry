   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 4:11-13 says, "He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The kinds of people spoken of here are slightly different from those spoken of in Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It must also provide ample opportunities for each one to manifest himself as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>V. THE TESTIMONY OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians 10:16-17 says, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever we come on the Lord's Day to break bread and remember the Lord, we acknowledge that the Lord has broken His body for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We also express that the Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The breaking of bread signifies the Lord's giving of Himself in love on the cross for us; the oneness speaks of the union among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every Lord's Day we come to the Lord to acknowledge that His body was broken for us and that all of God's children are one.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On this day he testifies that there is only one bread.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's children should gather together for the purpose of breaking bread and fellowshipping with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more one understands the Body of Christ, the more he will testify of the oneness of the Body through the breaking of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The breaking of bread is a remembrance of the Lord's death, and it is an expression of the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do this to show the world, the universe, and the whole creation that the church is one Body!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May the Lord be gracious to us, and may He show us clearly that the basis for forming the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
