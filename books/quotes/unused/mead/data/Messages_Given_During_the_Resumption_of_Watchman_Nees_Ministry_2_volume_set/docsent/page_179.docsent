   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Today, I ask Brother Nee to forgive me for all my past attitudes and words.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I also ask the responsible brothers to forgive me for my past attitudes and words.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was sympathetic toward Brother Nee's venture into business.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning the CBC Laboratory, I heard too many words, and they made me angry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, these angers spilled over to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Nee said, "The magistrates are the only ones that can light a fire; the common folks should not even light a lamp."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Translator's note: A Chinese idiom meaning that only one is allowed to do something, referring to Brother Nee's venture into business.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am not Brother Nee, and I cannot speak for him in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When others said that Brother Nee was wrong, how could I take such words?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I could not single out Brother Nee for blame.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result, I began to blame the other responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since they had promised that this the business venture was God's will already, how could I stop other brothers and sisters?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet when others came to me, they were bothered to the point of a mental breakdown, and I could not help but sympathize with them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is God's grace that I have not had a mental breakdown today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if ninety-nine percent of the responsibility lies with others, I still hold one percent of the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, I should say that I hold more than one percent of the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At one time, some people criticized the book The Normal Christian Church Life and asked me to say something bad about Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>People wanted to use me as a tool to oppose Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning the CBC Laboratory, I did tell people that it was a "gossip center."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My motive concerning the business was bitter, and my attitude toward Brother Nee was also bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would not say that I have never condemned anything; there were indeed things which I took offense in. Once a person got involved with the CBC Lab, their spiritual condition collapsed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If what has happened these few days had happened then, none of what I am saying would need to be said.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I wish that the tears I shed today would be my last tears.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I wish that when I leave the world one day, and others open up my closets, they will find them empty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If my closets are full, it will be to my shame.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I realize that it is better to prefer poverty than to prefer wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During these years, I did have the thought of selling everything I have.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes I cannot recognize my own belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Others always push me to buy something for myself, but I always give this and that kind of excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I seldom buy things for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I bought an overcoat, it was three people who literally dragged me to the store to buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I do not care much for my own clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am not saving things in my closets and keeping them for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As for cash, I cannot come up with even a thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I do not have a single piece of gold with me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I can testify for my conscience' sake that all that I have is worth nothing; everything I have is what I need for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, I can hand over my rice and my oil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can give my last drop to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The last time, when the church proposed to buy a piece of land, some people were blaming others, while others were plainly sitting back and watching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time, twenty pieces of gold would have done the job.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But we waited and waited, until all the money was gone, and everyone was still sitting there watching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because of this, we accomplished nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If everyone hands himself over today, what follows is the responsibility of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I open up myself this way today out of necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>My words end here.</S>
