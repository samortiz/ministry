   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING A TESTIMONY IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, along with our prayer and preaching, we must have a testimony in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without a testimony in life, our preaching and prayer will not be prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A person once preached the gospel to his colleagues for more than ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Day by day he did the preaching but without result.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is because he had no testimony in life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, he passed out tracts and preached the gospel, but on the other hand, he argued with people and easily lost his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That spoiled and hindered his preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is the need of a testimony in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to fall into the earth to die for Jesus' sake, and we must be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we will have a testimony in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Testimony of a Humble Employee</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I can never forget a certain brother who studied engineering in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After graduation he went back to China, and by the time I met him, he was the head of a department in our college.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was surprised that such a highly educated and high ranking person could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He told me his story, which was very inspiring.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For several years a certain brother worked under him in the government.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This brother held a very low position.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In China, especially in the early years, people in high positions looked down on those in positions like this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They considered them unequal to themselves and did not like even to talk to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However that brother, a lowly, small employee in that department, tried his best to contact the head of the department and tell him about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The head considered that since he had studied in America, he knew all about Christianity, and he did not need it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It seemed that the lowly brother could do nothing, but every morning he came early to the office and put a tract on the desk of the department head.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When that man came in, he saw it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This happened every day without exception for several years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That man was not happy with the brother, but he could not fire him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After about three to five years, the man spoke with his wife, who had also studied in America.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He said, "Let us go to that poor fellow's home and see what they are and what they are doing."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That he suddenly had such a thought must have been the Lord's answer to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The couple went to visit the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They went into his home and stayed for a certain time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The testimony was there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They noticed their family life and were impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After they returned home, they talked with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The man said, "We two are highly educated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You studied home economics, but how poor our home is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those people are from a lower class.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They have not been educated as we have been, but what a wonderful family life they have!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was the brother's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That couple again contacted the poor brother and his wife and asked them how they had such a beautiful family life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The brother's answer was simply that they had Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At this point the Holy Spirit convinced them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This highly educated couple in the highest position knelt down, prayed, and accepted the Lord, and they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not long after that, I was invited to their town, and I stayed in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They truly loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They were saved through preaching in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That was not only the preaching of the gospel; that was the imparting of life, the imparting of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I was also invited to the first brother's home.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He gave me the testimony with tears of how much he suffered just for that one couple.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was despised, looked down upon, and treated poorly because that man was in the higher position.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The department head was not happy with this poor brother, so he did many things to persecute him, and the little brother suffered all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Still, whenever he saw that high official, he always smiled at him humbly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Regardless of how he was treated, he was happy within and put a tract on his desk over a period of several years, even though all the tracts, without exception, went into the wastebasket.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have heard many such stories as this one.</S>
