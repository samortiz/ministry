      "snippet": " (3) Arians (A.D. 375): They maintained that Christ\u2019s divinity was incomplete and that He came into being through the union of the Logos and the human body. Therefore, He cannot be compared with God but is merely all-excelling, the most outstanding, the noblest, and the highest among men. The Word is not the self-existing God. Rather, He is the first of all creation. Arius asserted that Jesus was created by God, except that He was created before all creation. Hence, there was a time when He was not. Furthermore, all things were created through Him. Because Jesus died without sin, He was resurrected, ascended to the heavens, and thus became God. At the first general council assembled at Nicaea in A.D. 325, Athanasius (the first one who declared that the New Testament canon contains only twenty-seven books) opposed Arius. As a result, the council pronounced Arianism a heresy and established the creed that says, \u201cI believe...in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son [15] of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father.\u201d (The most crucial point is that He is of the same substance as the Father.)

      "snippet": " Arius, a pupil at Antioch, went to Alexandria (A.D. 313). He said that the Son was a creature before creation. Although He is the true [18] image of the Father, He is merely the image. He can forgive sins not because He has a sinless nature but because He was able to withstand the temptation of the devil. The Holy Spirit was the first item created by the Son. The bishop of Alexandria called a council and removed Arius from office. However, many people still followed Arius. Arius maintained his teaching, wrote hymns, and preached in many places. Many followed his teaching, and the controversy became intense. In view of this, Constantine called for the first council in Nicaea of Asia Minor (A.D. 325). Based upon strong arguments from Athanasius, a deacon graduated from Alexandria only a year prior to that, the council exiled Arius. The compromising group attempted to interpret a word in the Nicene Creed that speaks of \u201cthe same essence\u201d to \u201csimilar essence.\u201d Neither the Arians nor the compromising ones believed that the Father and the Son are of the same essence. In A.D. 381 the Roman emperor gathered the bishops of the eastern church and called for a second council. In that council both Arianism and the compromisers were condemned. Some in the compromising group said that the Holy Spirit was also created and acted as the messenger of the Father and the Son, similar to the archangel. Based on the Scriptures, the second council confirmed that the Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son, and like the Son, was sent by the Father. "

Arius also followed the same teaching concerning the Son\u2019s incarnation. Athanasius refuted this teaching, based on Origen\u2019s teaching that Christ must have a human spirit because this is a necessary link between the Word and the Lord\u2019s body of flesh. The council of Alexandria in A.D. 362 confirmed that the humanity of Christ is perfect. Apollinarius, the bishop of Laodicea, denied such a teaching and made a new assertion, saying that Christ has a human soul but not a human spirit. Instead, He has the divine Spirit in place of the human spirit. The second council condemned this teaching as unscriptural. However, it did not explain the relationship between Christ\u2019s two complete natures of divinity and humanity. "

      "snippet": " Now we come to the fifth creed, the Athanasian Creed. This creed was attributed to Athanasius, though it was not written by him. Athanasius was an attendant of the Nicene Council who served as an assistant (comparable to today\u2019s secretary) to one of the bishops who participated in the Council. He became famous, however, for speaking out against the teachings of the great heretic Arius. Arius erroneously taught that Christ was not the eternal God but an extraordinary, noble man who was later deified by God. Furthermore, Arius also had a wrong understanding of Colossians 1:15 and maintained that Christ is not the Creator since He is the Firstborn of all creation. This is a great heresy. Hence, in that council Arius encountered severe oppositions and thenceforth was condemned and exiled abroad. Because Athanasius was the most powerful antagonist of the Arians, some considered the creed adopted by the Nicene Council as his writing. "

However, not even this is God\u2019s goal. God in Christ is within us to build Himself into our being and to build us into His being. He builds His divinity into our humanity and builds our humanity into His divinity in order to mingle and blend His divinity with our humanity into one entity. This is like the meal offering: fine flour mingled with oil for the satisfaction of both God and man. "

There were approximately three hundred bishops present at the council. Constantine sat on a throne of pure gold and observed the debate among the bishops. He favored the orthodox group, that is, Athanasius and his followers, by constantly siding with them. Thus, the Council of Nicaea ordained a creed that supported the pure faith. Nevertheless, Constantine meddled in church affairs. After his reign, emperors had the power to send bishops away or recall them; the bishops were under the power of the emperor. Therefore, politics entered the church, and the church entered politics. "

In the Old Testament the most God could do with man was to make man separated unto Him but not one with Him.

Athanasius, for example, spoke about the Trinity, but he did not cover the compound Spirit, the sevenfold Spirit, Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit, or why before Christ\u2019s glorification the Spirit was not yet (Phil. 1:19; Rev. 1:4; 1 Cor. 15:45; John 7:39). Then we can deal with Luther\u2019s teachings on the Trinity. One by one we should compare and point out the shortages. After this, we can cover the all-inclusive Christ and the Christology of the early centuries. This is the way to touch the shortages of Christianity. We must critique in a high way and give people no ground to criticize us. People claim to have systemized Christianity, but they have not systemized it adequately. In their systematic theology they do not properly consider the Triune God, the compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25, or the sevenfold Spirit. Ours is the genuine and adequate systematic theology. "
