   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul experienced God as the God of all encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2 Corinthians 1:4 he testifies that the God of encouragement "encourages us in all our affliction, that we may be able to encourage those who are in every affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First we need to experience the encouragement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we shall be able to encourage others with the encouragement we have experienced of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, we are encouraged so that we may be able to encourage others.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His purpose in showing forbearance is to accomplish His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If God did not show forbearance to man, there would be no way for God to fulfill His purpose of accomplishing His economy.</S>
