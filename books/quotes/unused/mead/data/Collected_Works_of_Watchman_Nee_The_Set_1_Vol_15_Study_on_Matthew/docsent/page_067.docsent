   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 8:"If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can a person not be stumbled?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First he should mind himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If he will not stumble, others will not be stumbled by him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he is stumbled, others also will be stumbled because of him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you gamble, others will be stumbled, and they will gamble as well or will begin to despise Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the conduct of your hand and the action of your foot cause you to stumble, you should rather pay the greatest price to cut them off.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you retain them, you will stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If one keeps himself from any acts of stumbling, he will not be touched by the eternal fire, though such fire is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 9:"And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The "eye" here refers to the lust of the eye.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who lust after a woman by looking at her see the interpretation in Matthew 5:27-30 should pay the price to cut such conduct off.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are two reasons for stumbling: 1 a person is stumbled in himself; 2 a person despises others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, in order for one not to stumble others, he must not be stumbled himself, and he must not despise others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 10:"See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of My Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not despise anyone but should treasure their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The "little ones" refers to those who are worthless materially or physically.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The "angels" are the "ministering spirits" Heb 1:14 Scofield, Kelly, and other Brethren groups all said that the "angels" here refer to man's spirit Acts 12:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If that is the case, unless the little child dies, how can he always behold the face of the heavenly Father?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the ladder the angels are ascending and descending John 1:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They ascend with prayers and descend with gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we should not allow our angels to become idle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today we have the Holy Spirit in our hearts; hence, the ministering of the angels is rarely seen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 11:"For the Son of Man has come to save that which is lost."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only do their angels always behold the face of the Father in heaven, but the Lord's coming is to save them also.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we should not despise the little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verses 12-13:"What do you think?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If any man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and seek the one that has gone astray?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And if it so happens that he finds it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The explanation of this parable is similar to that of the parable in Luke 15:1-7, but the implications are different.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The parable in the Gospel of Luke tells sinners the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here it tells saved believers the intention of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Any man" refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord does not want to lose any believer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Goes astray."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A sheep is naturally dumb; if it goes astray, it cannot return see Isa 53:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Ninety-nine which have not gone astray."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is only an assumption; it surely does not refer to the righteous man, because there is not one righteous man in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Go."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that the Lord went Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not entrust this work to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Good Shepherd is willing to give His life for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 14:"In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones perish."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even so, the heart of the heavenly Father is unwilling that one of these little ones should perish.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How can we offend others or cause others to perish?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God takes pleasure in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although believers on the earth cannot enjoy the pleasure of this world, they should seek for their joy through saving others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since the Lord is not willing to lose a little sheep, and since God rejoices in granting salvation to others, believers should not stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if a person sins and offends you, what should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to consider verse 15.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 15:"Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If he hears you, you have gained your brother."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should still have a heart to recover such a one, as we would in saving a lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this verse the Lord did not correct the wrong and sinning brothers, but He corrected those who are not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every time a man corrects others, he should realize that he also is in the wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, it is easy to deal with a righteous person, but it is difficult to deal with an evil person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is easy for men to deal with proper things having an improper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Moses failed in this point; the Israelites erred, but Moses dealt with such a proper matter with improper words.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not become wrong just because others are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not help others and in the process become one who needs help yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you do, you also will fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When that happens, the only difference between you and them will be a matter of time one sins sooner and the other sins later.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"Between you and him alone."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is with no other people present; this means that one should hide evils.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"Reprove him."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is not to demonstrate one's prowess or dignity, nor to rebuke; rather, this is humility, which is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you rebuke such a brother, you consider yourself better than he.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>That is the self-boasting of the Pharisees Luke 18:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"You have gained your brother."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The purpose of a rebuke is to turn others through love.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verses 16-17:"But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"If he does not hear you."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You must exhaust all means the testimony of two or three witnesses, the arbitration of the church before you can deem him 1 a Gentile, with whom you cannot associate, and 2 a tax collector, who is despicable.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There is no need to excommunicate this kind of person, because most of their sins involve merely being too strong in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, if a person sins as in 1 Corinthians 5:11, he needs to be put away immediately.</S>
