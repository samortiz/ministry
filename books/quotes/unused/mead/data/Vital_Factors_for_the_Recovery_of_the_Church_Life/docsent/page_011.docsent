   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Being the Spirit after His Glorification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit is the realization of Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God John 14:17-20; Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The entire Triune God is embodied in Christ, and this Christ is fully realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the embodiment of the Triune God, Christ went through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to 2 Corinthians 3:17, today, after His resurrection, that is, after His glorification Luke 24:26, 46 , Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the Spirit is the full realization of Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, the Spirit is simply the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After passing through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God in Christ became such a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This life-giving Spirit entered into us as our life and essence, and He also came upon us as our power for His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we are one with the Triune God, who is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE FACTOR OF THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At this point we need to consider what is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As I mentioned previously, when the Triune God moves, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, this Spirit comes into us to live within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When He lives within us, He is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God moves, He is the Spirit; when God lives in us, He is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus far we have covered the first three factors for the recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These three factors are Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is God embodied, the Spirit is God moving, and the divine life is God living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have Christ as the embodiment of God, we have the Spirit as God moving, and we have the divine life as God living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since we have the divine life, by what life should we live?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all need to realize that if we live by our natural life, practically speaking we are outside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I was born a typical Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, I do not live by the Chinese life, but by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This divine life is simply God living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is a group of people living by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This divine life is simply the all-inclusive Spirit living in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This all-inclusive Spirit is the realization of the all-inclusive Christ, and the all-inclusive Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the church is the manifestation, the expression, of the Triune God 1 Tim 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, we have Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life as three vital factors for the recovery of the church life.</S>
