   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Y. As the Transforming Spirit, Conforming Us,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His Many Transformed Brothers, to His Image</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the transforming Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit conforms us, His many transformed brothers, to His image, the image of the firstborn Son of God, that we may fully be what He is Rom 8:29; 1 John 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit's transformation has a goal, and that is to conform us to the image of the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ as the firstborn Son of God is the model, the mold, to which we all must be conformed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In baking bread, there is the need of a mold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once we have the mold, the dough can be placed into the mold so that it will have the same image as the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is the mold, and we are the dough.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before being placed in the mold, we are without a proper image.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But once we are put into the mold, we have the proper image.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the saints bear the same image because they have all been placed into the same mold.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Colossians 1:15 tells us that Christ "is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 16 then says that all things were created in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before God created anything, He first created Christ as the mold, the model.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this model all the other creatures were created.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How could Christ be created first?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was created by putting on human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By putting on human nature, Christ became a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But how could His putting on human nature, which took place after Adam was created, cause Him to be the Firstborn, the first creature?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The answer is that there is no element of time with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With Him there is only the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the universe there is the fact that Christ was created first among all the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then, this Firstborn of creation became a mold, or a model, for a mass production.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Was Christ crucified before Adam or after Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Revelation 13:8 Christ was slain from the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that He was crucified before Adam was created.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After drawing a circle, we will not be able to locate the starting point or the ending point.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we put a dot on some point on the circle, it would be difficult to say what is before that point and what is after it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Adam was before Christ, and he was also after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is actually the first because He is the center and centrality of God's move Col 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is difficult to say whether we are before or after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to human history, Abraham was before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in John 8:58, Jesus said, "Before Abraham came into being, I am."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The proper grammar for the phrase "I am" should be "I was."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because Abraham was in the past, the Lord Jesus was grammatically wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But according to actual fact, He was right because He is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the great I Am, He is the eternal, ever-existing God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, He was before Abraham and is greater than Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With Him there is no element of time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The transforming Spirit will conform us to the image of the firstborn Son of God that we may fully be what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First John 3:2 says, "Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The real meaning of this verse is that the glorified Christ in our spirit will both saturate us vertically and permeate us horizontally, filling us that we may express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, we will be conformed to His glorified image and be exactly as He is.</S>
