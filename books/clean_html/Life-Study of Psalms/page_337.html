<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. His Prayer Being against Evil Deeds</H2><P>In 141:5b David said, "Still my prayer is against their evil deeds." This indicates that David's enemies were doing evil things but that David's prayer was against these evil things. Here David seemed to be saying, "In spite of the evil things that come to me, I am still praying. I do not do anything except pray against these evil deeds." Our situation, however, is often quite different. When bad things happen to us, we may forget to pray. For instance, when a brother and his wife are exchanging words, he may forget to pray. How much better it would be if the brother, instead of arguing with his wife, would pray against that thing. We need to learn of David to pray against evil deeds.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Jehovah Knowing His Path<br>When His Spirit Fainted within Him</H2><P>In 142:3a David had a very particular utterance. He said, "When my spirit fainted within me,/You knew my path." When David was troubled and his spirit fainted, he did not know what to do or what path to take. At such a time he realized that Jehovah knew his path.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Saying That Jehovah Is His Refuge</H2><P>In his prayer in 142:5 David said that Jehovah was his refuge, his portion in the land of the living. Here David spoke a very good word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Saying That No One Alive<br>Is Righteous in God's Sight</H2><P>"No one alive is righteous in Your sight" (143:2b). When David prayed in this way, he was including himself among those who were not righteous in the sight of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Saying That He Spread Out His Hands<br>to Jehovah and That His Soul Thirsts for Him<br>like a Parched Land</H2><P>"I spread out my hands to You;/My soul thirsts for You like a parched land" (143:6). Instead of arguing with others, we should spread out our hands to God and have a soul that thirsts for Him.</P>
