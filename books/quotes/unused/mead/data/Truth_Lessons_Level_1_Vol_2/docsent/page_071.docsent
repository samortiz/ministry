   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the coming age the kingdom of God is the millennial kingdom, composed of two parts, the heavenly and the earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The heavenly part is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens within the kingdom of God, in which the perfected and overcoming saints of both the Old and New Testaments will be priests of God and of Christ and co-kings with Christ for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The earthly part is the Messianic kingdom, which is also the restored kingdom of Israel; the saved Israelites in the future will be priests in it, and the restored nations in the future will be the people.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the new heaven and new earth in eternity, the kingdom of God is composed of two kinds of people: the regenerated saints as the sons of God and the restored nations as the people of God.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It began with the Old Testament saints and is realized in the church in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It will be completed in the New Jerusalem in the millennium and ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s divine life, which is Christ Himself, is the seed of the realm of the divine life that develops into the kingdom for His ruling.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To inherit God s glorious kingdom in the coming age and obtain the full enjoyment of the eternal life of God is different from the receiving of eternal life as our life in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The former is to receive a reward in the coming age; the latter is to receive salvation in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To the believers, the kingdom is an exercise in this age and a reward in the coming age.</S>
