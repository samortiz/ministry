   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Outside of religion</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew always gives a hard time to the religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everything that Matthew tells us concerning Christ is outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the first portion of Matthew 16 we read, "Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi..." v. 13 . If you look at the map, you will see that Caesarea Philippi was far to the north, even north of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was at the farthest extreme of the region of Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isaiah 9:1 tells us that the land of Galilee was of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this place was even further than Galilee; so it was more gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was almost outside the Holy Land; at best we could say that it was on the border.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In those days there was the holy place, the holy temple, the holy city, and the holy land a four-fold holy sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jesus kept Himself away from every one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The holy things in those days were the religious things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By the term "four-fold holy" is meant four times religious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The land was religious, the city was religious, the temple and all the things within it were religious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi and got away from all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus did not bring His disciples into the city of Caesarea Philippi; He was there just in the parts, the area, the district of that place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In that totally gentile setting He asked His disciples, "Who do men say that the Son of man is?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, "Who do those people in the religious circle say that I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we would see or learn something of the Lord Jesus, we must be removed from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you still remain in religion, in any of the denominations or so-called Christian churches, it is difficult for you to receive any revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must leave all the religious things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the temple the priests were praying, offering their sacrifice, burning the incense, lighting the lamp, etc. whatever they did was altogether religious; whatever could be seen was nothing but religion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus took His disciples out of the priesthood, out of the temple, out of the city, and out of the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He asked, "Who do men say that the Son of man is?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And they answered, "Some say John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets" 16:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They answered with the names of all the religious "big shots."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the way the religious people spoke of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their realization concerning the Lord Jesus was wholly religious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord never appreciates this kind of realization.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the Lord Jesus turned to His disciples and told them in effect to forget all that religious realization.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He asked, "Who say ye that I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And Simon Peter answered, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . According to the record of the four Gospels, Peter was nearly always mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There was only one time he was right this was the time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter was one who always took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A person who is so quick to take the lead will surely make many mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peter was this kind of person, always putting his foot in his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This time, however, he was one hundred percent right.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He called Jesus "the Christ, the Son of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is revelation.</S>
