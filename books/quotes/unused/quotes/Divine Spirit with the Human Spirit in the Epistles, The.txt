The Gospels are a full record of the Lord Jesus Christ-who He is, what He did, what He accomplished, and what He attained
After this, the Acts gives us a record of the spread, the propagation, of this Christ, which is the church as the Body of Christ
In the four Gospels we have the Head, and in the Acts we have the Body, the propagation and continuation of the Head
According to who Christ was, we may say that He was God, but according to what Christ was, we must say that He was Spirit
Now, according to who Christ is, we must say that Christ is both God and man, but according to what Christ is, He is both Spirit and flesh
Christ as God became a man, and Christ as Spirit became flesh because man needed an offering with blood for the purpose of redemption
In the same Gospel, verse 10 of chapter 10 is the word of Christ Himself: 'I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly'
The first chapter of this book tells us that in the beginning Christ was the very God but He became flesh to be the Lamb of God to redeem us
In His incarnation as God, He became flesh, but now in His resurrection as a man, He became the life-giving Spirit
We must emphasize this for the sake of the young believers, because today in Christianity many important matters have been neglected
Previously, in mainland China we did not have watermelons in the winter time, so a melon at that time seemed like something to treasure
In verse 17 the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit of reality would be with the disciples, and then in verse 18 he said, 'I am coming to you'
After speaking to His disciples, He delivered Himself to the people to be put on the cross where He was crucified to accomplish redemption
On the third day He was resurrected from the dead, and on the day of resurrection He came back to the disciples in a very mysterious way
On that evening the doors were shut in the house where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, but suddenly Christ was among them
Even though no one opened the door, He came into the room and told His disciples to touch His resurrected body
He lived on this earth for thirtythree and a half years and at the end of His earthly life He was put on the cross to accomplish redemption
Christ became flesh to accomplish redemption, and then He took another step to become the Spirit to impart life into us
The Lord here is the Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit is the One mentioned in verse 6 which says The letter kills but the Spirit gives life
It was not until Christ accomplished redemption, passing through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension that He came into man
Now Christ as God is the all-inclusive Spirit with redemption, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
Acts 1667 says And they passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia
It is through the spreading of this wonderful all-inclusive Spirit that the church, the Body of Christ, came into existence
What is taking place in this book is the spreading of Jesus as the wonderful Spirit to produce the Body of Christ, which is the church
If we consider this book and the churches in the early days with this point of view, we will have a new understanding
The foregoing is the foundation and preparation to consider the twenty-two Epistles from Romans through the book of Revelation
Redemption has been accomplished, and now He is the Spirit who gives life for us to enjoy, experience, and partake of
Accordingly, we may summarize our burden for these messages with four sentences: In the Gospels, Christ was life outside of us
After justification there is something deeper and further that is accomplished, not by the death of Christ but by His life
Reconciliation by the death of Christ has been accomplished already, but salvation by His life is still going on
Following this, 6:4 says that we walk in the newness of this life, and 7:6 says that we serve God in newness of spirit
Sonship is the reality of being a son; thus, the spirit of sonship is the spirit of the reality of being a son
While someone is cooking in the kitchen, before she brings the meal to the dining table, she may taste a little of what she is making
Today we are enjoying the Spirit of life and the Spirit for our sonship very much, but even this is only a foretaste
According to the book of Romans, the Spirit of life is doing a fourfold work within us, a work of four aspects
They learn to reckon that they are dead , believing that it is by this reckoning that they will be freed from sin
Whether or not someone knows the power of electricity, if he simply touches the electricity, he will be burned
If we are in the Spirit of life and in the light, we will realize how much deliverance we need concerning our attitude
The element of the fall still remains in our attitude, motives, intention, thinking, loving, hating, decisions, and in many other matters
If we are in the Spirit of life, we will have a deep conviction that in all these matters we need more and more deliverance
We need to be delivered out of our temper, disposition, way of thinking, way of loving, way of hating, and many items
The Spirit of life not only liberates us from bondage and delivers us from the fall but also saturates us with God
Eventually He will saturate us with and bring us into the glory of God, not in an objective way but in a very subjective way
One day the Spirit of life will saturate us with the glory of God to the extent that we will be glorified in His glory
Often while we are dressing once again there is something within us witnessing As a child of God you should not wear this kind of clothing
Although the phrase build up is not in the book of Romans, the thought and concept of building is found in chapter 12
All the sons of God are the members of Christ, and all these members need to be built up and coordinated together
We become the living, true, proper members of the Body of Christ, and the Spirit of life and of sonship builds us up together
The Spirit of life and of sonship is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit
Eventually, sinners become the glorious sons of God, sons of God in glory, who are built up together as the Body of Christ
All these items are included in the divine salvation by Christ being life to us, and they are worked out within us by the life-giving Spirit
Today the church needs more messages telling people how much we need to experience Christ as the wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit of life
Not only do we need to be reconciled to God, to be saved from many negative things, but we also need to enjoy God positively
We should compare the words mind, I, and myself to boast in God, reign in life, walk in newness of life, and serve in newness of spirit
Finally, 12:2 says, 'Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
Originally it was the old, independent mind, but from this time onward it is being renewed to fulfill the purpose of the spirit
The key point of the Christian life is that Christ is in our spirit and that this wonderful Christ is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
God, man, crucifixion, incarnation, resurrection, ascension, glory, power, life, and everything are all in Him, and He is within us
Both the man living in the flesh sinfully in Romans 1-3 and the man living in the soul morally in Romans 7 are wrong
Both the Spirit and our spirit have a long story, and now these two spirits are mingled together as one spirit
Rather, we must pay our full attention to walking in the spirit, because this is where the wonderful Christ is today
When we set our mind on the flesh, we have death, but when we set our mind on the spirit, we have life and peace
When we set our mind on the spirit, we have Christ as life strengthening us, nourishing us, and being our enjoyment
We should forget about our temper and a thousand other matters, not pay any attention to them, and simply turn our mind to the spirit
We need to forget about our weaknesses, shortcomings, temper, and other failures and pay attention to nothing other than the spirit
If we act, speak, move, work, and have our being in the spirit, remaining in the spirit, we will be transcendent
We will unconsciously and unintentionally fulfill everything that the law demands, because we will surpass the requirements of the law
When we are cold, we always know how to count the cost, but when we are burning in the spirit, we are foolish, forgetting about the loss
If we have never done something foolish for the Lord, if we have never been beside ourselves, we have never been a good Christian
There are many wonderful stories of people who were so burned by the Lord that they did something 'foolish' for Him
Romans 14:17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
All the matters mentioned in the last portion of this book, from chapters 12 through 16, are the things we will enjoy in our spirit
The Christ who was on the cross as the redeeming Lamb is within us today as the life-giving Spirit, mingling Himself with our human spirit
Our whole being will be transformed by the renewing of the mind, and we will be conformed to the image of the Son of God
It is not easy for many Christians to receive the proper light concerning the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians
Even though the apostle presents the Spirit in a particular way, many today are too impressed with the supernatural gifts of the Spirit
Verse 9 says, 'God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
Verse 30 says, 'Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
Interpreting spiritual things with spiritual words in verse 13 is to explain spiritual things by spiritual means
The Spirit explains the spiritual things, the deep things of God concerning Christ, by means of spiritual words
The deep things of God are Christ Himself, and the things that God has given to us freely are also Christ Himself
If we live and walk in the soul, we become soulish and natural men, men who cannot receive the things of Christ
In 1 Corinthians 1 we have Christ as our portion, and in chapter 2 we have the Spirit as the way, the means, for us to enjoy our portion
Corinthians 3:1-3 says, 'And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ'
In chapter 3, however, he said that he could not speak to the Corinthians as to spiritual men but as to fleshy
Paul spoke to the Corinthians as to fleshy, because among them there was even one who committed incest with his stepmother
For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man'?
The Corinthian believers, who had received all utterance and knowledge and were lacking in no gift, were short of Christ
Verses 7 through 9 say, 'So then neither is he who plants anything nor he who waters, but God who causes the growth
If anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each will become manifest'
Verses 16 and 17 continue, 'Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
By growing in life we are transformed into these precious materials, and by being transformed we are built up together
In 1 Corinthians 3, therefore, the indwelling Spirit is the feeding Spirit, the transforming Spirit, and the building Spirit
We will grow in life, and it is by this growth that we are gradually transformed into precious materials for the building of God's house
All these are related to God's cultivated land that grows something to be blent as fine flour to make a loaf, signifying the Body of Christ
When our soul and our body are both under the control of our spirit, the spirit can manifest something of God in our body
The Holy Spirit within us today is working to transform our soul, occupy our body, and separate our time to the Lord
Is a person who has been occupied by the Lord, taken over by the Lord, saturated and permeated with the Lord, and mingled with the Lord
Even when he did not have the feeling that he had the Lord's direct commandment, he could still speak something of the Lord
Whatever he spoke was the word of God, because by this time the apostle Paul was a person truly joined to the Lord as one spirit
Verses 7 through 10 go on to speak of the manifestation of the Spirit given to each one for what is profitable
Verses 11 and 12 say, 'But the one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one respectively even as He purposes
For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ'
These many sons of God and brothers of Christ are the living members that form the Body of Christ as His corporate expression
We all must be metabolically and inwardly changed in life, nature, and disposition and be renewed in our mind, will, and emotion
Along with the building Spirit in 1 Corinthians there is the thought of the need of transformation for the building
Now the following book, 2 Corinthians, tells us that this indwelling, building Spirit is the Spirit who transforms us
Ephesians 1:13-14 also tells us that God has sealed us with the Holy Spirit and given us the Spirit as the pledge of our inheritance
Originally, it may have been only wood with a natural color, but as we paint it, the paint is added to the wood and even worked into it
For God to anoint us means that He paints us with Himself and the more He anoints us the more His element is added to us and wrought into us
As He anoints us with Himself, His 'ingredients' are being worked into us; that is, we have more of His element within us
From our appearance, our countenance, people can recognize that we are children of God, those who belong to the Lord
Even if we do nothing but stand here, the believers can still recognize that we are children of God, their brothers and sisters
We need to have a living mark, a living seal, that tells others that we belong to God, that we are children of God
In addition He has put the Holy Spirit within us as a down payment a guarantee and a deposit to ensure that all that God is is our portion
The more God anoints us, the more He seals us, and the more we enjoy the pledging Spirit, the more we are transformed
The Spirit here is the writing Spirit to write Christ into us, and our heart is the tablet for the inscribing Spirit
Our heart mainly surrounds our spirit, being composed of our mind, emotion, and will, in addition to our conscience
The transforming Spirit is waiting for the opportunity to write Christ into our mind emotion and will to make us complete epistles of Christ
The indwelling Spirit, who is the transforming Spirit, is doing the work of writing in us, but we need to give Him our cooperation
Verse 6a goes on to say, 'Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit'
We must minister Christ to people to cause those who listen to our message to become the living epistles of Christ
Ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit indicates that the Spirit here is the ministering Spirit to minister, to write, Christ into us
Life also includes strength; to be weak means that we are short of life, but to be full of strength means we are full of life
In addition, to be in the light and full of light means that we are full of life, but to be in darkness means that we are short of life
When we have rest, comfort, and peace, that also means that we have life, but to be short of these indicates that we are short of life
We must open ourselves from the depths of our being so that we may truly have an unveiled face, a face with no covering or hindrance
Verse 7 of chapter 4 says, 'We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us'
Verse 16 says, 'Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day'
The outer man must be crossed out so that we can give the Spirit the opportunity to renew our inner man day by day
Verse 5 of chapter 5 says, 'Now He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the Spirit as a pledge'
Again we have the Spirit as the guarantee, the pledge, but here the guarantee is for a heavenly tabernacle, a glorious body
At the present time we are in a temporary, earthen body, but the Lord promises us that one day He will change our body into a glorious one
Regrettably, many Christians know, 'My grace is sufficient,' but very few know that this sufficient grace is in our spirit
Some may say that since Paul's suffering in 2 Corinthians 12 was in his body, the grace must also be in the body
Even if there is a certain amount of suffering in our body, our whole being will not suffer if our spirit within is strong
Out of this love, Christ comes as our grace, and Christ as grace comes into us by the transmission of the Holy Spirit
Out of God Himself as love, the transforming Spirit continually transmits and communicates Christ into us as our sufficient grace
Now we simply enjoy and experience this grace, and it is in this grace that day by day we are being transformed into His image
The Spirit in this book has a specific position, because without theSpirit it is not possible for us to experience Christ
On the negative side, the Lamb redeems us to bring us back to God, and on the positive side, the Spirit fulfills God's eternal purpose
The blessing that God promised to Abraham is that He would give the Spirit to the nations through Christ as the seed of Abraham
God is the fullness, Christ is the embodiment and expression of the fullness of God , and the Spirit is the reality of all that Christ is
Stated another way, God the Father is the source, God the Son is the expression, and God the Spirit is the transmission
The central item and blessing of the gospel preached to Abraham was that God would give this Spirit to all the chosen ones
After Christ came and accomplished redemption, this promised Spirit was given to us and is now being supplied to us
Verse 6 continues, 'And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
When we walk in the Spirit, live in the Spirit, and sow unto the Spirit, this indwelling Spirit produces fruit
Even when we do the good work of restoring a fallen brother, we must do it not in our self or soul but in our spirit
Because the order of the books of the New Testament was arranged by the Holy Spirit, the sequence of the Epistles is very meaningful
In 1 Corinthians there is the building Spirit to give us the growth in lifeand build us together as the house, the temple of God
In 2Corinthians we have the transforming Spirit, because for God's building there is the need for transformation
On the negative side, the message of the book of Galatians is that we should not care for the law, that is, for trying to do good
We need not to do good but simply to walk in the Spirit, have our being in the Spirit, sow unto the Spirit, and work in the Spirit
To try to keep the law is to exercise the flesh, but to live by Christ and live out Christ requires us to exercise our spirit
Now when we are in our spirit, we touch Christ, enjoy Christ, and experience Christ, and Christ becomes our grace
We need to walk by the Spirit, live in the Spirit, sow unto the Spirit, and do everything in the Spirit for God's pleasure
If these blessings were physical, material blessings, they would need to be enjoyed and experienced by us in our physical body
If they were psychological blessings, we could realize them by exercising our soul-our mind, emotion, and will
Since the nature of all these blessings is spiritual, we need to exercise our spirit to realize, enjoy, and partake of them in our spirit
In actuality, all the blessings mentioned in this book are spiritual blessings of the Holy Spirit, which we can realize only in our spirit
We should not question whether or not we have the Holy Spirit as a seal within us, but whether we have believed in Christ
God has put the Holy Spirit into us as a divine mark to prove, testify, and declare that we are His inheritance
Also, the sealing Spirit Himself deep within confirms that we have been marked out and gives us the likeness and appearance of God
Ephesians 1:14 continues, 'Who is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory'
The Holy Spirit within us is the pledge, earnest, down payment, deposit, guarantee, foretaste, firstfruit, and sample
The Holy Spirit within us, who is the seal and the pledge, is now working to reveal, to unveil, all these things
In Colossians 2:2 the mystery of God is Christ, who is the 'story' of God, the explanation and expression of God
In Ephesians the mystery of Christ is the church, because the church is the 'story' of Christ, His explanation and expression
The spirit here is the human spirit of the apostles and prophets, a spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God
To see the mystery of Christ, which is the Body of Christ, requires a revelation in our spirit by the Holy Spirit
When we come to the book of Ephesians, we must not overly exercise our mentality to understand, analyze, or argue
In this way, we will receive not merely an understanding of the teachings but a revelation and a vision in our spirit
When the Spirit gives us a revelation, He also gives us the wisdom to grasp and understand what we see in this revelation
The Holy Spirit also works to cause all those, to whom He reveals the things of the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ, to be one
Formerly, the Jews were separated from the Gentiles, but now in the one Spirit the Jewish believers are one with the Gentile believers
If we merely study the teachings of the Bible, after a short time we may disagree with one another and be divided
The more we turn from merely studying to praying in theSpirit, the more we will have the uniting Spirit to be one
Verse 22 of chapter 2 says, 'In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit'
The result, the issue, of the strengthening of the Spirit in our inner man is that we are filled unto all the fullness of God
The next aspect of the work of the Holy Spirit is that He renews all the parts of our soul-our mind, emotion, and will
To be drunk is to be filled in the body with wine, but to be filled in spirit is to be filled in our human spirit with the Holy Spirit
After we have been strengthened, renewed, and filled within, we are equipped and qualified to do the work of fighting as an army
Ephesians begins with the revealing Spirit, followed by the uniting, building up, strengthening, renewing, and filling Spirit
In the book of Galatians the Spirit is for us to take Christ as our life and live Him, and in Ephesians the Spirit is for the Body life
After these books we have Philippians, which reveals the secret of experiencing Christ as our life and everything
In chapter 4, Christ is not only our outward pattern for us to follow but our inward power, empowering us all the time in every circumstance
The experience of Christ in Philippians is mostly in four aspects, related to our circumstances, the unbelievers, the believers, and God
We magnify Christ in any kind of circumstance, condition, state, or situation, whether through life or through death
In order to magnify Christ, we need to preach and impart Him to the unbelievers, presenting Him as the good tidings
It was not a damage or a loss to him but a salvationbecause of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Acts 16:7 says, 'When they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them'
The Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ are not four different Spirits
It is by the Spirit that Jesus was able to live a proper human life, suffering much, enduring hardships, and bearing all the persecutions
In the second stage, God became the man Jesus so that the Spirit of Jesus could be the Spirit of the incarnated Savior
In the third stage, He was designated the Christ in resurrection and ascension so that He may be the Spirit ofChrist
In hardship and persecution we need the Spirit of Jesus, and to live out the resurrection life we need the Spirit of Christ
At that time the writer, the apostle Paul, was in a prison, suffering yet having the expectation that he would magnify Christ
In order to suffer, he needed the Spirit of Jesus, but in order to magnify Christ, he needed the Spirit ofChrist
Rather, he was part of a heavenly, spiritual 'chorus' with the Spirit as his Choragus to afford him a bountiful supply
If we need a wife, He will assign a proper, suitable wife, and if we need a certain kind of child, He will give us one
We may illustrate this with electrical appliances, which are able to operate because of the empowering of electricity
Regardless of the circumstance or state we are in, we can do all things in Him who empowers us so that He may be magnified in our body
In order to experience Christ and enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we need to do the work of preaching the gospel
The more we preach the gospel to present Christ to people, the more we will enjoy the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit within us
On the other hand, if we do not preach the gospel, we will suffer the loss of the supply of the all-inclusive Spirit
In our prayer meetings, for example, it is mostly the same persons who pray every time, and certain others are accustomed to being silent
The older brothers and sisters should give the opportunity to the younger ones to open their mouths to fellowship in the meetings
The more we reject our natural mind consideration and feelings and turn to the mingled spirit the more we will open our mouths to fellowship
There is a kind of fellowship among the electrical lamps in a building, which is the current of electricity that flows within them
If we remain in our soul, the fellowship stops, but if we turn to the spirit, we immediately sense the flowing in the spirit
In whatever happens to us, we must remember that within us there is the all-inclusive Spirit supplying us all the time
To worship and serve God by the Spirit is to worship and serve in the resurrection power not in anything natural in the flesh or by our self
When we remain in the soul, we are not able to fellowship with the believers, nor can we preach the gospel in a prevailing way
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is the flow, the all-inclusive supply, of the Spirit, and this grace, flow, and supply is with our spirit
Because the book of Colossians emphasizes the Christ who is all and in all, there is little mention of the Spirit in this book
Christ is all and in all to us but we need spiritual wisdom the wisdom of the Spirit in our spirit in order to know all the things of Christ
In order to know Christ we need to be in the spirit, and in order to live out Christ, we need the love of the Spirit
It is in the spirit that we have the wisdom to know Christ, and it is by the Spirit that we have the love to live out Christ
The first group of the Epistles is Romans through 2 Thessalonians, and the second group is 1 Timothy through Jude
You became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit'
Verse 8 of chapter 4 says, 'Consequently, he who rejects, rejects not man but God, who also gives His Holy Spirit to you'
Then He remembered the days of old Moses and His people Where is He who brought them up out of the sea With the shepherds of His flock
In creation God brought millions of items into existence, but in incarnation the Creator brought Himself, the holy One, into His creation
Just as we may say 'the Eternal' or 'the Divine,' referring to the eternal One or the divine One, 'the Holy' refers to the holy One
The Spirit in whom the apostles brought the gospel and whom the Thessalonians received is the holy One, the Holy Spirit
In the last thirty years the Lord has shown us that holiness is God Himself, the holy One, coming into common man to make man holy
When the divine Spirit inspired the writers of the Bible He was very careful and meaningful in the use of words including the divine titles
Acts 166 and 7 say They passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia
In this incarnation the Spirit of God was the Holy Spirit to bring God into man to make man holy, that is, to sanctify man
It is by the Holy Spirit that this gospel is brought to us, and it is by this Holy Spirit that we receive the gospel
When we receive the gospel, God gives us the Holy Spirit that He may do the work of sanctification in us to make us holy
Verse 22 says, 'But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life'
John 1715 through 17 say I do not ask that You would take them out ofthe world but that You would keep them out of the hands of theevil one
According to the history of the Lord's work of recovery, thetruth of sanctification was not yet recovered at the time ofMartin Luther
About one century later, the Brethren in England recovered the second aspect of sanctification-separation from the world
When gold is in the homes or market, it is common, but when it is placed in the temple, the temple makes it holy
We may now add a golden-colored juice into the water, signifying the addition of the divine element of God into us
Stanza 3 of Hymns 509 says The river does the Spirit show Coming mans spirit to supply That with Gods riches he be filled Holy to be thereby
When we take God as food into us, we assimilate Him as our nourishment, and His substance and element become our 'ingredients'
We are now under the process of sanctification, but at that time our sanctification will be fully accomplished
In 1935 we began to see the third aspect of sanctification, and within ten more years we began to see the fourth aspect
Darby helped us to see that holiness is the nature of God, and sanctification is the practical effect produced by holiness in action
The Spirit within us is the Holy Spirit, who is constantly doing the work of sanctification in us to make us holy
God's salvation includes three steps: the regeneration of our spirit, the transformation of our soul, and the transfiguration of our body
If we do not quench theSpirit but always go along with Him, we will not need to care about overcoming sins or being separated from the world
The Spirit whom we must not quench is the sanctifying Spirit, the Holy Spirit who brought God into Mary's womb to be incarnated there
Today we are the saints, but we are not manifested as saints, because the process of sanctification has not yet been completed in us
It is through this sanctification by the Holy Spirit that we are under the process of being fully saved day by day
As the Lord saturates us, we are transformed in our soul, conformed to His image, and transfigured in our body, that is, glorified
By the Lord's work of saturation, we will be transformed and glorified; that is, we will be sanctified in our whole spirit, soul, and body
The Triune God as glory has been 'injected' into us, and He is now waiting for the opportunity to spread, saturate, and permeate our being
At the time of our glorification we will experience full redemption, the redemption not only of our spirit and our soul but also of our body
The first step of sanctification is that we are kept from sin, and the second is that we are separated from the world
Gradually we are transformed in our soul, and eventually we will be transfigured in our body, that is, glorified
We must be wholly sanctified from within to without, until every inward part is full of Christ and brought into the new creation
Just as people exercise in gymnastics for the sake of their body, we need to exercise ourselves unto godliness
There is no need to proclaim that we manifest God in the flesh or to try to prove that our life and walk is one of godliness
The sense and realization that we have by the vindicating Spirit within tell us whether someone's love is good or whether it isGod Himself
The brother is a human being in the flesh, but his love is the expression of God; it is in godliness, God manifested in the flesh
The submission that a sister shows to her husband may seem good, but in actuality it may be with a poor attitude
By this Spirit we can realize whether or not our love, humility, submission, patience, and goodness are God Himself
If we are not persons in the Spirit, we can be cheated by others, but if we have the Spirit and are in the Spirit, we cannot be cheated
The more someone loves us, the more we may realize that this love is not godliness, the manifestation and expression of God
Many times in the New Testament this term denotes not only the Spirit Himself but the Spirit mingled with our human spirit
To depart from the faith, to give heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons, and tospeak lies in hypocrisy are all ungodliness
His speaking is not outside of us; it is an inner speaking, the speaking of the Spirit mingled with our spirit
The Spirit within our spirit warns us to be on the alert, because in the latter days there will be many things contrary to godliness
According to the Epistles to Timothy, the good deposit is not only the Triune God but also the teaching related to the Triune God
The above three aspects of the Spirit-justifying, speaking, and guarding-are all for our exercise unto godliness
For this exercise we need not only the vindicating, speaking, and guarding Holy Spirit but also our regenerated human spirit
Timothy 1:7 says, 'God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness'
Our spirit, which is at the center of our being, is surrounded by the soul with its three parts-the mind, emotion, and will
Because we have these divine rich powerful and adequate provisions it is not only possible but even easy for us to exercise unto godliness
According to the thought of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, this renewing work of the Holy Spirit has much to do with the exercise unto godliness
The indwelling Spirit is always working to renew us, and under this renewing we are able to exercise ourselves unto godliness
The word for washing in Greek is the word for laver, the vessel in the temple that contained the washing water
To rebuild a typewriter or remodel a house does not involve life, but the change in condition produced by regeneration requires life
The more we are renewed, reconditioned, and remodeled, the more we express Christ and manifest God, that is, the more we have godliness
By all that we have said above, we can see that the Epistles to Timothy and Titus are not for us to 'pastor' a church
Itis for us to exercise a strong spirit with Christ in it, trusting in the Spirit who justifies, warns, guards, renews, and reconditions
By this Spirit with our regenerated spirit we can exercise unto godliness, imparting and ministering life to others
We need to drop the thought of 'pastoring' and be filled with the thought of being good ministers of Christ who are nourished in the word
