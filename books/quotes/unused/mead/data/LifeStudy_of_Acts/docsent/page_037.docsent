   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Author of Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 3:15 Peter went on to say, And the Author of life you killed, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here the Greek word rendered Author is archegos, meaning author, origin, originator, chief leader, captain.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It denotes Christ as the origin or Originator of life, hence, the Author of life, in contrast to the murderer in the previous verse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse the King James Version has the Prince of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a poor rendering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 3:15 archegos does not denote a prince; it denotes the very source, origin, even originator, of life, the Author of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here Peter is saying that the Healer is the source of life, the Originator of life; He is the Author, the Chief Leader, in life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Peter was indicating that the Healer is not merely a Healer He is the source, origin, and Initiator of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What we have in chapter three of Acts is not merely a matter of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we see the imparting of life into others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to propagate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For such a propagation, we need the Lord as the Author of life, as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians, following traditional theology, read the Bible in a shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the reason I encourage the saints to drop traditional theology and come back to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Bible there are many deep mines in which we need to dig.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One of these deep mines is the Greek word archegos in 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to see where life is, where life comes from.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word Author in verse 15 indicates that life comes from this Healer, who is the Holy One and the Righteous One.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Healer has not only the power to heal; He Himself is the source, the origin of life, for He is the Author, the Originator of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we have life, we also have healing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reason people become sick is that they are weak in life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Medical doctors know that when we are weak in life, we may become ill.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if we are strong in life, the life will swallow up death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peter wanted the people to realize that the One they killed is the Author of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is not only the Healer He is the Author of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But although He was killed, God raised Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have pointed out, regarding the Lord as a man, the New Testament says that God raised Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But considering Him as God, it tells us that He Himself rose from the dead Rom 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, the apostles were witnesses of the resurrected Christ, bearing witness of His resurrection, which is the crucial focus in the carrying out of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 3:16 Peter said, And by faith in His name, His name has made this man strong, whom you behold and know; and the faith which is through Him has given him this perfect soundness before you all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Greek words rendered by faith in His name literally mean on the faith of His name, that is, on the ground of faith in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The name denotes the person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The person backs the name; hence, the name is powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verses 17 and 18 Peter goes on to say, And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as also your rulers did; but the things which God announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ should suffer, He has thus fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The redeeming death of Christ was first determined by God in eternity 2:23 and announced beforehand through the prophets in the Old Testament time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This proves again that Christ s death was not an historical accident, but an act planned by God according to the purpose of His good pleasure and announced beforehand through the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Prophet</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 3:22 and 23 Peter indicates that the Lord Jesus is the Prophet: Moses indeed said, A Prophet will the Lord your God raise up for you, from your brothers, like me; Him you shall hear in all things, whatever He may speak to you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And it shall be that every soul, whoever does not hear that Prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, in this chapter we see that the Lord Jesus is the Servant, the Holy One, the Righteous One, the Author of life, and the Prophet.</S>
