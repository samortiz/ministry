   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DAILY LABORING DOUBLE ON CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters, when you come to the meeting, do you expect to hear a capable speaker?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Your concept of relying on capable speakers must be turned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the first thing I want to do tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What should we do after we all have turned our concept?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all have had experiences of having our concepts turned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the moment he is saved, everyone has his concept turned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we had to learn to pray, read the Word, know the truth, grow in life, experience Christ, gain Christ, and enjoy the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is our good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we labor on Him, daily working on Christ, we shall reap a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s way of working is always balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You see that a man has two hands and two shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The left side is the big meetings and the right side is the home meetings; thus the big meetings and the home meetings are balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After we are balanced, we need to double our prayer, double our reading of the Bible and our seeing of light from the Bible, and double our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Home Meetings Being the Way</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>to Achieve the Building Up</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the church, all the brothers and sisters love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is based upon your love of the Lord that I have the burden to lead you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since you love the Lord, you must mean business with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your love for the Lord should not be vain talk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do you love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let me tell you, the Bible tells us that the Lord has only one way to build His church, to reach His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This way is the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is something that the big meetings cannot accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The big meetings in Christianity are like the age of the judges.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The age of the judges depended entirely upon a spiritual giant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a Samson rose up, it was good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he died, Israel was through.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The age of the judges of the Old Testament prefigured today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we only pay attention to big meetings and neglect the home meetings, we are reenacting the story of the age of the judges.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must have our concept turned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not want judges; we want homes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every home must be strong, and to have a strong home, you must first be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is preferable for the home meetings to have not more than twelve people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Five or six is the best.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Seven or eight is also good.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eight or ten is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because we love Him and mean business with Him, we pray daily, read the Word, learn the truth, see the light, experience Christ daily, and labor on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we come together, the eight or ten of us all have experiences to share.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then spontaneously we will not just come to be a part of an audience depending on others to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Last night I met a Dutch brother.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He spoke Chinese very well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He told me that he can speak Dutch and that he has also learned German, French, English, and Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He knows five languages.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today, is it easier for you to follow Christ, experience Christ, enjoy Christ, or for a Dutch man like him to learn Chinese?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He can turn his Dutch tongue into a Chinese tongue and speak Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why can we not turn our tongue into a Christ tongue ?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is because we are not willing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We love the Lord, and every day we carry our Bible bags and rush to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let us not just bring our Bible bags.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Please read the Bible and learn to speak the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then you will have experiences to bring to the meetings and the meetings will be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Spirit in Acts is the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He speaks continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If everyone in a meeting rushes to speak first, if one has not finished speaking and another wishes he would quickly finish speaking, would that meeting not be rich?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>With meetings like this time after time, everyone s taste for depending on the big meetings will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The ones who were just brought in and the ones who have not been meeting for a long time will no longer be concerned with the big meetings, and they will feel that the small meetings are also very good.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A church meeting like this will have turned from building on the wrong foundation to building on the right foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only a church like this is worthy of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It does not matter whether the capable speaker will come today or not; we can meet by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This church then has a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church in Taipei is both big and stable, yet it may not be reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If the concept here is turned to the point that, even if the so-called capable speakers do not come for ten years, the church still flourishes and progresses, then we will have succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should preach the gospel and lead the brothers and sisters to stand firm, so that everyone is a soldier and our army is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this way the church will be stable.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At that point we will really be able to evangelize Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we continue to depend on big meetings and cannot even evangelize ourselves, how can we evangelize Taiwan?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If your small family has not been evangelized and your relatives have not been evangelized, it is impossible to evangelize Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need the Holy Spirit to initiate the work so that even a newly saved one can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every family speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everyone speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Every saved one is a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Experiencing Christ and Overflowing with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I hope that everyone s concept will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only after our concept is changed will these things follow: intensifying our prayer and reading the Bible; intensifying our fellowship with the Lord; intensifying our pursuit of light, truth, and seeing the vision; growing in life to follow the Lord; enjoying Christ; and gaining Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you have all these, you will have something to say in any meeting you attend.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In your home meetings now, there is some giving of testimonies and some calling of hymns, but this is mostly done in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some of these things have become a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Both the natural way and the way of regulation are not right.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What is right?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You must stay home to pray more, read the Bible more, fellowship with the Lord more, have more experience of life, and seek more light and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you are like this every day, when you stand up to speak, what you say will not be natural or by way of regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You will have so many riches that you will overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This matter of overflowing is the following of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Formerly, I did not know what it meant to be carried along by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Now I am clear.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You pray, read the Bible, experience the Lord, and you are filled with the Lord within.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then wherever you go, the Holy Spirit carries you along.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When you are full and come to the home meeting, your speaking will not be according to the natural way; neither will it be by way of regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Rather, it will be the outflow of the Lord s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You overflow, and I overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This home meeting will then be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In the home meetings we speak in everyday language.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Everyone can speak this language.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Whatever you hear in your daily life, you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You do not need to put on a show or to pretend; you simply overflow naturally and spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The foundation of the church is not with the long sermons of the apostles, but with the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You give a testimony, and I speak a word of enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If everyone speaks, this will add up to an abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Seeing and hearing this, the newcomers and the newly recovered ones will all receive the profit.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In this way the foundation of the church will be solid and the church will last.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>THE SIX COMMISSIONS OF THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The first thing we must do is change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The home meetings are not merely a method.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>From now on we will neither uplift the big meetings nor despise them.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We will regard the big meetings and the home meetings equally.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>According to today s situation, you should not consider that to recover someone, you must bring that person to the big meetings in order to be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Of course that is very good, but you should not require this.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>As long as he can come to the home meetings every week, that will be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>First, lay this foundation in him.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Second, the home meetings should strive to recover those who have not been meeting for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In Taipei, there are tens of thousands of brothers and sisters who have not been meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The three to five thousand of you who are meeting regularly must all be in the home meetings to recover those who have not been meeting for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Third, preach the gospel widely.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The home gospel must go out from the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Even the campus work can go out from the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The homes are the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If the homes are not strong and even you yourself need shepherding, then who can shepherd?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If the home meetings are not strong, even the children s work cannot be done.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>For a nation to be strong, the homes must be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>For a church to be strong, the home meetings must be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The homes are the foundation, the base, of all activities.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Fourth, keep the people.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The home meetings must keep and uphold people and even cause people to want to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>You have to work on the home meetings to such an extent that they have the power to attract and keep people.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Fifth, you need to strengthen the riches in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>The content of the home meetings must be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Sixth, when the home meetings become so rich, the highest goal of expressing Christ will be attained.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>The home meetings are not easy to build up.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>This is a great and high mountain which is not easy to climb.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Beginning with changing our concept, then recovering those who have not been meeting for a long time, widely preaching the gospel, upholding, strengthening and enriching the content of the meetings, we will finally reach God s highest goal for the church expressing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>May we all pray for this matter.</S>
