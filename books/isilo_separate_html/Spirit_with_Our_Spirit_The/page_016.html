The Spirit of Jesus</H2><P>In the New Testament, the life-giving Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7). This title of the Spirit is concerning Jesus in His humanity, who passed through human living and death on the cross. It indicates that in the Spirit there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and suffering of death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Spirit of Christ</H2><P>The Spirit of Christ is concerning Christ in His divinity, who conquered death and became the life in resurrection with the resurrection power, indicating that in the Spirit there is the element of divinity that became the death-conquering and the life-dispensing Spirit (Rom. 8:9b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Spirit of Jesus Christ</H2><P>The Spirit of Jesus Christ refers to the Spirit, comprising all the elements of Jesus' humanity with His death and Christ's divinity with His resurrection, who becomes the bountiful supply of the unsearchable Christ for the support of His believers (Phil. 1:19b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Lord Spirit, the Pneumatic Christ</H2><P>The Lord Spirit is a compound title (2 Cor. 3:18) referring to the pneumatic Christ. This is similar to the compound title the Father God. This does not mean that the Father and God are separately two. The Father and God are one. The pneumatic Christ refers to Christ as the Spirit. Christ and the Spirit are not separately two; They are one. The Lord Spirit is the pneumatic Christ.</P><P>The Lord Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, is for the metabolic transformation of the believers into the Lord's image, from one degree of glory to a higher degree of glory (2 Cor. 3:17-18). Such transformation takes place by the renewing of the mind (Rom. 12:2b), and this is for the growth and the building up of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 3:6, 9b, 12a; Eph. 4:16b).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
