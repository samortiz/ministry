<li>When we are in the fellowship, the enjoyment, of God as the eternal life, we partake of God in His divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4) as Spirit, love, and light; Spirit is the nature of God&rsquo;s person (John 4:24), love is the nature of God&rsquo;s essence (1 John 4:8, 16), and light is the nature of God&rsquo;s expression (1:5):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we spend an adequate amount of personal time with the Lord and remain in the fellowship with Him daily and hourly, we will enjoy the Lord as the Spirit, and we will become persons who are full of the divine love (the inner substance of God) and the divine light (the expressed element of God)&mdash;v. 3; 2 Cor. 13:14:
		<ol class="decimal">

		<li>The divine light is the divine life in the Son operating in us; this light shines in the darkness within us, and the darkness cannot overcome it&mdash;John 1:4-5; 1 John 1:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we enjoy God by touching God and being infused with God in the divine fellowship, we walk, live, move, and have our being in His Spirit as our person, in His love as our essence, and in His light as our expression for us to be His corporate testimony&mdash;Rom. 8:4; Eph. 5:2, 8; Matt. 5:14-16.</li>
