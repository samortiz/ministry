<p>The third way of gospel preaching is to preach the gospel to the children. This requires the sisters to pick up the burden. It is not necessary to use the meeting hall as the place for the gospel meeting. Rather, it is best to meet at the saints&rsquo; homes. Use the weekends to gather the children from your neighborhood and to invite the children of your relatives and friends to your home. Many times parents are saved through their children, so do not overlook the children&rsquo;s work. If, starting from now, we use our effort to work on the gospel for children whose ages range from six to twelve, then after ten or twelve years, they will be those who will rise up to bear the responsibility of the church service. This way may seem slow, but it is actually very fast. This way is also profitable.

<h2 class="head1">SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS<br />
AND PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN THE HOMES</h2>
<p>A small group should gather once a week in the homes, and we also need to preach the gospel in our homes. Strictly speaking, every brother and sister, whether strong or weak, progressing or backsliding, should preach the gospel in their home. We should keep the principle of preaching the gospel in our own homes and not ask others to preach for us. We all know that the best tasting rice is the rice that we have cooked for ourselves. Even if we do not know how to &ldquo;cook,&rdquo; it only takes a little practice. Therefore, we encourage the brothers and sisters to open their homes. Every household should preach the gospel. Sometimes the wife can preach the gospel, the husband can give a testimony, and the children can strengthen the words of their parents. Sometimes the children can preach the gospel, the mother can give a testimony, and the father can strengthen the words of the children and the mother. It is very meaningful when the whole family rises up and preaches the gospel. Some recently recovered saints, who used to be unwilling to meet, are taking the lead in this kind of family gospel meeting. In addition to the aforementioned meetings, we suggest having a small group gathering every other week and a family gospel meeting in the intervening weeks.

<p>In the past the children&rsquo;s meeting was always held in the meeting hall and was mostly led by the young people. Now the gospel work on the college campuses and at the junior high and high schools is very active, and the young people all have specific services in this work. Thus, they cannot take care of the children anymore. Hence, we need to rely on the elderly saints to spend the time and effort to teach the children...The elderly saints may use their homes. After the children get off from school, the elderly saints may open their homes and prepare some snacks to welcome them. Then they may sing with the children, tell them stories, and lead them to know God.</p>
<p>Every one of us should be able to do these three things&mdash;pray every day, join the small group meetings, and go door-knocking and have home meetings every week. The fourth matter is taking care of the children. I hope that more people will receive the burden to open their homes to take care of the children. Twenty years ago, I said that we should have ten thousand children in Taipei, and then ten years later we would have ten thousand young brothers and sisters. If the saints had taken this word and practiced it, we would have twenty to thirty thousand young people today. Moreover, gaining people in this way is very safe, because they are taught by us and receive the gospel from us from their youth. Thus, they should be very solid. If this were the case, many young saints would not need to put aside their gospel work at school to do the children&rsquo;s work. I hope that from now on the elderly saints would pick up the burden and take the lead to do this in their homes. The effect will be very promising in the long run.
