<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN HIS RESURRECTION</H2><P>Acts 2:32 says, "This Jesus [the Son] God [including the Father and the Spirit] raised up." The dead Jesus was raised up by God. Acts 10:40 and 41 show us that, on the one hand, God [including the Father and the Spirit] raised this One [the Son] on the third day; on the other hand, He [the Son] rose from the dead. Regarding the Lord as a man, the New Testament tells us that God raised Him from the dead; considering Him as God, it tells us that He Himself rose from the dead. Romans 8:11 refers to "the Spirit of Him [the Triune God] who raised Jesus [the Son] from among the dead." The "Spirit of Him" may also be translated "the Spirit of the One." The One who raised Jesus did the raising by the Spirit. These verses show us that the Divine Trinity was involved in the resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN HIS ASCENSION</H2><P>The Divine Trinity can also be seen in the Son's ascension. According to Acts 1:11 and 1 Peter 3:22, Jesus Christ [the Son] went into heaven. In His ascension [the Triune] God highly exalted Him [the Son] (Phil. 2:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN HIS SALVATION</H2><P>[The Triune] God our Savior saved us through the renewing of the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ [the Son] our Savior (Titus 3:4-6). According to Colossians 1:12-13, the Father delivered us. First Timothy 1:15 says that Christ Jesus [the Son] came into the world to save sinners. John 3:5 says that unless a man is born of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Thus, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit all participated in our salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</H2><P>In the Christian life, the believers possess the Divine Trinity and should live in and with the Divine Trinity. The Father is in the believers (Eph. 4:6), the Son lives in the believers (Gal. 2:20), and the Spirit abides in the believers (John 14:17). In 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul said, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [the Son], and the love of God [the Father], and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." Then Jude told us that we should be those who, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep ourselves in the love of God [the Father], awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ [the Son] (vv. 20-21).</P><P>The revelation of the Divine Trinity in 2 Corinthians 13:14 and Jude 20-21 match each other. In both portions there is the love of God (the Father). The mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Son) in Jude matches the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Son) in 2 Corinthians. In the Lord Jesus is grace, and when grace is extended to us and reaches us, it is mercy. Finally, praying in the Holy Spirit in Jude matches the fellowship of the Holy Spirit in 2 Corinthians. Praying is a kind of fellowship.</P>
