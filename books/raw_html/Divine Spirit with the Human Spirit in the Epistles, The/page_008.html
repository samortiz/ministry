<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ENJOYING GOD, REIGNING IN LIFE,<br />
WALKING IN NEWNESS OF LIFE,<br />
AND SERVING IN NEWNESS OF SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10-11, 17; 9:5; 6:4; 7:6, 25; 8:2, 4, 16; 12:2, 11; 14:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING GOD AND BOASTING IN HIM</h2>
<p>Romans 5:10-11 says, &ldquo;If we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled, and not only so, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.&rdquo; To boast in God is to glory in God and enjoy God. Now God is our portion, and we enjoy Him. Not only do we need to be reconciled to God, to be saved from many negative things, but we also need to enjoy God positively. Verse 11 speaks of reconciliation, rather than atonement. Atonement, or expiation, is an Old Testament concept; it does not belong in the New Testament. Redemption is much better than atonement. In the Old Testament, before the accomplishment of redemption, people needed atonement, but because redemption has now been accomplished, there is no further need of atonement. Now we have God as our portion and enjoyment, and we enjoy Him and glory and boast in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REIGNING IN LIFE</h2>
<p>Verse 17 says that we will &ldquo;reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In the book of Romans, we enjoy God and we reign as kings in life. This is not merely to overcome our temper or deal with besetting sins in a miserable way. This is to reign as kings gloriously. We enjoy God, boast in Him, and reign in life.</p>
<p>The very God whom we enjoy, in whom we boast and glory, and who is our portion, is Christ. Verse 5 of chapter 9 says, &ldquo;Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever.&rdquo; Christ our portion is the very God who is blessed forever. Likewise, Christ is the life in which we reign. Moreover, He is the life-giving Spirit, and He is within our spirit (8:2, 16; 1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Tim. 4:22). Christ is our God and our life. In this God we boast, glory, and joy, and in this life we reign as kings, ruling over all things. This is the revelation in the book of Romans.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING IN NEWNESS OF LIFE<br />
AND SERVING IN NEWNESS OF SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Verse 4 of chapter 6 says, &ldquo;Walk in newness of life.&rdquo; Since Christ is our life, to walk in newness of life is to walk in the newness of Christ. Then 7:6 says, &ldquo;Serve in newness of spirit.&rdquo; We walk in newness of life and serve in newness of spirit. <em>Spirit</em> in verse 6 is our human spirit, and Christ today is in our spirit. We need to serve in the newness of the spirit in which Christ dwells.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Chapter 7 brings us back from our deliverance by life to the old man, the self, the evil &ldquo;I.&rdquo; Verse 25 says, &ldquo;So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin.&rdquo; The phrase <em>with the mind I myself</em> sounds like ugly music. We should compare the words <em>mind, I,</em> and <em>myself</em> to <em>boast in God, reign in life, walk in newness of life,</em> and <em>serve in newness of spirit.</em> With the mind, I, and myself there is no joy or newness, but only ugliness. Chapter 7 is a deep valley, but after the valley chapter 8 is the glorious mountain peak. Verse 2 of chapter 8 begins, &ldquo;For the law of the Spirit of life.&rdquo; This is the unique verse in the Bible that uses the term <em>the Spirit of life.</em> Many Christians today emphasize the Spirit of power, but not many consider the Spirit of life. What we need is not so much the Spirit of power but the Spirit of life. We are not motorcars that need more power. Rather, we are grains of wheat that need life. Our power must be the power of life, the power of resurrection, not a power apart from life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT<br />
AND BEING RENEWED IN OUR MIND</h2>
<p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit,&rdquo; and verse 6 continues, &ldquo;For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; Chapters 7 through 12 show us a process with respect to the mind. First, 7:25 says, &ldquo;With the mind I myself serve the law of God.&rdquo; This is an endeavoring, a striving, which does not avail for us. Here the mind is the means to serve with our self. No doubt, this is the independent, old mind. Then in chapter 8 the mind is turned in the right direction; it is turned to the spirit and set on the spirit. Finally, 12:2 says, &ldquo;Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; Here the mind is in the process of being renewed. Originally it was the old, independent mind, but from this time onward it is being renewed to fulfill the purpose of the spirit. Now the mind can be used by the spirit as its organ.</p>
