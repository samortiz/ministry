   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>My position among God's children is quite unique and exceptional.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The churches and God's children have to bear the responsibility for such uniqueness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is they who have made me so unique.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fact is: I am not unwilling to learn, but there are many reasons involved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we are training those who are already on the way, who are involved in the work, and who are taking some responsibility in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The work here in Kuling can only make the good ones better and the useful ones more useful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It does not attempt to change those with different opinions or who take different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The work in Kuling touches the innermost part of man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I say the innermost part, not the deepest part.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If anyone has different opinions or takes different ways, I cannot release anything before them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is like talking to friends.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If outsiders are among us, it would be hard to speak intimate things to our friends.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If anyone among us has a somewhat different attitude, if he has any criticism, or if he has the slightest doubt about us, we do not want him to come.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the mountain we speak intimate words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If anyone here feels that he is in the wrong place, tell us and we will remove his name from our list.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot deal with opinionated ones here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One opinionated one means that I have to waste much energy on him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not want to entertain those who come just with their ears or eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My ministry is for those who want to receive it; it is not for sightseers and spectators.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may blame me for these limitations, but I truly know that this is my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please allow me to fulfill my ministry while on this mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I will not interfere with any of the problems or affairs of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those away from the mountain do not know what we are doing on the mountain, but you have to know.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Unless I have a group of people in one accord here on the mountain, I cannot fulfill my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here I am not serving as a minister of the church, nor as a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please give me the liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please allow me to give myself away freely, and please do not interfere with what I am doing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let me mention the three main things which we have covered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, I have spoken of selling our possessions and handing over ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, I have spoken of conducting the work in the principle of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Third, I have spoken of the whole Body rising up to serve in the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These three things must be preached when you leave the mountain here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As for your personal experiences, I hope that you will learn many lessons before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have presented the principles of life and service to you, as well as the way of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have spent myself on you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I doubt if anyone else has given himself to you in the way that I have done.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the reason I do not want to spend time on those who criticize or who take different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not have the burden to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I beg you not to force me to serve all the Christians in general.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What we have spoken concerning the daily living and character of a minister should not be spread.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some of our words should stay here on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now you may go.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But this does not mean that all your problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During the past few months, I have been burdened for every one of you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have noticed how you have moved on.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although I cannot say that all of you have climbed many mountains, I can say one thing: At least you have all moved on.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You have all taken a step forward.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am not speaking for myself, and I have no intention to speak for myself, but I can say that God has granted us mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This mercy does not come all the time, nor is it something that God freely gives.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many times God speaks freely, and we can say that it is God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Except for the two meetings in the morning two days ago, we can say that there is very little lack or shortage in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is rare to see God speaking in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The light you have received here is special.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many of you have just started on this way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I hope when I see you again the next time, I can find a certain measure of spiritual accumulation in you and a certain knowledge of the spiritual pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I hope that you will all reap abundant results from this training.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When you leave here, you will encounter all kinds of circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You will face all kinds of demands in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time you will find the supply, and you will have to supply others as well.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At least you should be able to say that you have seen the way to serve God today, and you should be able to do your best to serve in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you can do this, you will be a faithful minister of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Concerning the political situation, it is impossible for God to gain ground in the church and in us without working in the surrounding environment at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can see that the defeat of Japan is God's answer to the church's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today God can answer the church's prayer again.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In a war, it is God's children who ultimately suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No matter who wins in the coming days, our only wish is that we will be allowed to meet and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May the Lord open the way for us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I hope that you will launch forward with a firm determination.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I hope that you will not miss the way ahead of you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>WATCHMAN NEE'S PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Lord, go with these servants and maidservants of Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May Your grace be with them for as long as their pathway stretches.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May Your solution be found wherever a problem appears.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May You defeat all the enemies before them, and may the enemies never be allowed to flourish in even one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Grant them the grace to break Satan's fiery darts and arrows.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>May You go forth with them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Go before them in places where they have not gone before and work before them in areas where they have not yet labored.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Open a straight way before them and keep them faithful and steadfast.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Grant them light all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do not allow them to remain in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Do not allow anyone to become lost or cut off from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Bless them richly.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>May none of them be left behind or lost.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May they learn to place themselves in Your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Bless them and be gracious to them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Amen.</S>
