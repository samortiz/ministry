   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO PRINCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CHRISTIAN LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here, I would like to add another principle for living: the principle of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You could say that everyone in the world can live according to at least three principles: they can live by sin, or they can live by right and wrong, or they can live by life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people live on earth by following the lusts of their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are sons of wrath who are bound by the fashions of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They live and act according to the operation of the evil spirits in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their principle for living is that they live by sin Eph 2:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This morning I do not want to speak about this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that many among us have already left the principle of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What we will consider this morning is apart from the principle of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These two trees represent two principles of living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After becoming Christians, some people live by the principle of right and wrong, while others live by the principle of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In speaking about this matter, I am making the assumption that we have already left the principle of sin and are walking before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we would consider a little, we would see that some people live according to the principle of right and wrong or good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please remember that the principle of right and wrong, the principle of good and evil, is not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christianity is a matter of life, not of being according to a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christianity speaks of life, not of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christianity teaches life, not right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are many young brothers and sisters here this morning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I would like to tell you that after you received the Lord Jesus and gained a new life, you gained something marvelous inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You obtained another principle of living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if you do not know about it, you will set the principle of life aside and begin to follow the principle of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE MEANING OF FOLLOWING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE PRINCIPLE OF RIGHT AND WRONG</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is the principle of right and wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our conduct is controlled by the principle of right and wrong, then we ask if something is right or wrong whenever we have to make a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Would it be good to do this, or would it be evil?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we ask whether it is good, we are, in effect, asking ourselves, "Am I right to do this or not?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many people consider much whether something is good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They consider whether they can or cannot do a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They ask, "Is this right or wrong?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As they carefully consider a certain matter, being Christians, they determine whether it is good and right to do that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By taking care to decide whether or not something is good and right, they consider themselves to be good Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's Word says, "The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the most, this practice is only a discerning of good from evil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At best, it is merely choosing and rejecting choosing good and rejecting evil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christianity does not have an outward good and an outward evil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It does not have a definite standard in place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I may choose something good and reject something evil today, but this is not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is the Old Testament, the law, worldly religions, human morality, and human ethics, but it is not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>CHRISTIANITY IS BASED ON LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christianity is life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christianity is not a matter of asking whether something is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christianity is a matter of checking with the life inside us whenever we do something.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What does the new life which God has given us tell us inwardly about this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is very strange that many people have only seen an outward standard, the standard of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But God has not given us an outward standard.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christianity is not a new set of Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Christianity we have not been brought to a new Sinai, nor has God given us a new set of rules and regulations with "Thou shalt" and "Thou shalt not."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christianity does not require that we ask whether something is right or wrong, good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the contrary, whenever we do anything, there is a life within us which rises up to speak with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we feel right inwardly, when we feel the life inside of us moving, when we are strong within and sense the anointing, we know that we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many times something is right and good in the eyes of man, but strangely the inner life has no response and grows cold and retreats.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Please remember, God's Word tells us that our Christian living is based on an inner life, not an outward standard of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many worldly people, who are not saved, live according to the best standard of living they can attain: the principle of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you or I also live by the principle of right or wrong, we are the same as worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christians are different from non-Christians because we do not live by an outward standard or law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our subject is not human morality or concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not determine whether something is right or wrong by subjecting it to human criticism or opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today we have only one question: What does our inner life say?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the life is strong and active within us, we can do this; if the life is cold and retreating within us, we should not.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our principle for living is inward instead of outward.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the only real principle of living; the others are false.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>People may say that many things are right to do, and I may feel that to do them is right, but what does the sense of the inner life tell us?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The inner life does not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we were to do them, we would not be rewarded, and if we were not to do them, there should be no shame, because they are outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We can only see what is really right when the Spirit of God operates within us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we feel that there is life inwardly, then that matter is right.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we do not feel the inward life, then the matter is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Right and wrong are not decided by an outward standard but by the inner life.</S>
