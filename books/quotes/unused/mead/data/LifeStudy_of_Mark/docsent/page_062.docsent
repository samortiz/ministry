   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE CRUCIAL MATTERS The Ten Commandments</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we study 7:1-23 carefully, we shall see that the Lord s word here actually covers all of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord even uses the word commandment in verse 8: Leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then in verse 9 He goes on to say, You nicely set aside the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 13 the Lord speaks of the word of God, pointing out that the religious ones were invalidating the word of God by their tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this portion of the Gospel of Mark the commandments are the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we study this portion of Mark, we see that here the Lord s word is concerned with the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first four of the Ten Commandments are related to the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fifth commandment is about honoring our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 10 the Lord specifically refers to the commandment to honor our father and mother.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The remainder of the Lord s word recorded here deals with the last five commandments, the commandments about fornication, theft, murder, false witness, and covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we consider all these matters together, we shall see that the Lord s conversation with the Pharisees and scribes, the crowd, and the disciples was based on the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For the Pharisees and scribes to invalidate the word of God meant that they were invalidating the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is important for us to see that in this section of the Gospel of Mark the Ten Commandments are covered by the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Tradition and Man s Heart</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mark 7:1-23 actually covers three crucial matters: the commandment of the Lord, the word of God; the tradition of man; and the real condition of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The condition of man s heart is always exposed by the word of God, or the commandments of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the tradition of man always covers up the condition of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason, wherever tradition is maintained there is hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of exposing the real situation of man, tradition covers it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord even says that the Pharisees and scribes nicely set aside the commandment of God so that they could keep their tradition v. 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Apparently traditions are good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually they are subtle, and those who maintain such traditions are hypocrites.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In religion today there is much hypocrisy because there is so much tradition to cover up man s real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the word of God always exposes man s inward situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this short portion of the Gospel of Mark, the Ten Commandments are applied.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus is actually repeating the Ten Commandments and using them to expose man s inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whereas the Pharisees and scribes were concerned with the washing of hands, there is no mention of such washing in the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is important in the application of the Ten Commandments is not that we wash our hands, but that we come to worship God with a sincere heart, honor our parents, and faithfully carry out our duties.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s commandments do not expose the dirt on man s hands; they expose the filthiness in man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the Lord repeats the Ten Commandments in order to uncover the actual condition of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I encourage you to look into this portion of the Gospel of Mark according to these points.</S>
