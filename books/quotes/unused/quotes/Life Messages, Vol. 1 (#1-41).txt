The companion volume Truth Messages includes eleven messages given during weekly ministry meetings in Anaheim California in the fall of 1978
The period of David was for the preparation of the building materials and the period of Solomon was for the actual building of the temple
When Christ comes again to reign, these materials will be brought together, and the building of the church will be realized
If you do not consider the teaching of the New Testament, you may be influenced by this teaching concerning the building
Because the greater Solomon was there already, it is not accurate to say that only after His second coming is Christ typified by Solomon
It is not accurate to say that we are being prepared today and that we shall be built only after Christ comes again
According to the concept of some teachers the building of the church is not yet only the preparation of the materials is taking place today
Although these teachers did have a concern for the building of the church, their understanding of it was not accurate
In saying these words, the Lord certainly did not mean that the building of His church would begin at the time of His second coming
Ephesians 2:21 says that all the building is growing, and the next verse says that we are being built together into God's dwelling place
Verse 13 speaks of a fullgrown man and verse 15 says that we should hold the truth in order to grow up in everything into the Head Christ
The process of building will be completed, not at the time of the Lord's coming back, but at the end of the millennium
It began on the day of Pentecost, the beginning of the age of grace, and it will be completed by the end of the age of the kingdom
The completion of God's building will be in the new heaven and new earth, which will appear after the millennium
Although the building is going on today, the majority of Christians are not concerned about it and have no heart for it
By considering our experience and by examining the Word, we have found that if we do not keep the oneness, we have no way to grow in life
We may advance in knowledge or improve our behavior, but we cannot have the genuine growth in life apart from keeping the oneness
We need to keep this oneness until we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God
We need to keep the oneness of the Spirit as we go on to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God
Although we have not yet arrived at a fullgrown man at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ our destiny is such an arrival
If we do not have the growth in life, we cannot keep the proper oneness, for the oneness of the Spirit is maintained by the growth in life
They will exhaust you to the uttermost and then, after exhausting you, will complain that you have no patience or sympathy
Of unifying the saints or the churches, we should minister life to them and help them to eat well and grow normally
We are a very large family and we are all on the way toward arriving at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God
Sometimes we may visit a church that is full of experience, filled with grandfathers and grandmothers who are all very qualified
After visiting such a church, we may be convinced that it is the best because everything is excellent and there are no problems
You may find it difficult to tolerate such a family and prefer a family composed of two elderly people where everything is quiet and neat
After visiting the home of such an orderly family, you may be influenced to say that your home is poor because it is so noisy
Because we believe in life, we can leave the saints and the churches to life, praying for them and ministering the life supply to them
If you do not have the proper growth in life, you will not be able to be one with the saints in another locality if you move there
If you have the real growth in life, you will be able to be built together with others whom you have not met before
If you cannot be one in the place where you are, do not think that by moving elsewhere you will be able to be one
Throughout the years, we have greatly emphasized, perhaps over-emphasized, the corporate aspect of the Christian life
If you do not go to the Lord directly and privately by yourself, your dealing with the Lord will not be very practical or detailed
You need to lay a good foundation in the Word of God by reading through it consecutively from Genesis to Revelation
If you build up the habit of reading the Word and spiritual books, you will be healthy spiritually and you will grow
If you pray, study the Bible, and read spiritual books for several days without receiving any light, you have some problem
When you receive light on certain matters, accept the light and confess to the Lord immediately without excusing yourself
If we pray read the Word and are enlightened we shall spontaneously and immediately be filled with the Lord and the Lord will be added to us
Matthew, you may think, is too complicated, too tough to chew on, and Mark is not all that interesting, but John is as sweet as candy
In chapter fourteen this One who is life declared to His disciples that the Spirit of reality would come and abide with them and be in them
Now consider chapter twenty when the Lord in resurrection came back to His disciples and breathed upon them and said Receive the Holy Spirit
If you take Christ as your life, you will not say even a word without the assurance that you are speaking with Him
If we are concerned about how to meet-in a quiet way or a loud way, with or without guitars-this is a sign that we are off
If God had given us only the Spirit without the Word, we could easily be misled, because the Spirit is not tangible
If you care only for the Word and disregard the Spirit, you may be accurate in your beliefs, but you will be dead within
After not too long a time you will have the sense that your spirit is extinguished and that you have no way to kindle it again
When you run out in the spirit and have no words on your lips to pray, there is a prayer book you can turn to, the Bible
If you think this is practicing psychology, try picking up a book about Abraham Lincoln or the thoughts of Confucius
Our meetings will not be something theatrical but a living testimony of Jesus not a performance but an actual testimony of our daily living
We want to satisfy You by living You out as a testimony and by coming together in You, with You, and into You'
The Lord's simple illustration in John 15 of a vine and branches and a husbandman reveals nothing less than this
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in Me'
Inside a radio are some complicated mechanisms which must all work properly in order for it to receive the waves from the air
The proper service or worship of God is that we give Him an opening so that He can infuse Himself into our being
If you will just confess that one thing, that initial confession will be a little turn to lead you onto the highway
It is best to get away by yourself, away from the phone and everyone else, or at least take the phone off the hook
You may come to the meetings and listen to the messages, but after a time you will conclude all the messages are about the same
In addition, read the books The Economy of God, The All-inclusive Christ, The Knowledge of Life, and The Experience of Life
If we can learn to use our time this carefully, there will be plenty of time to pray, read the Bible, and read some spiritual books
Just keep praying daily, reading the Bible daily, and digesting a Life-study Message or one of our spiritual books
Just as a little child gradually picks up new words and learns to talk, so little by little you will learn to talk to the Lord
The Bible doesn't say that if you confess your sin in detail, sincerely, and in the name of the Lord Jesus, you will be washed
If you are not willing to confess your sins, the Lord is legal, but as soon as you are willing, He is not legal
Probably what Andrew Murray meant is that you need to set aside a time when you are free from taking care of your affairs
In this time the best way to keep yourself quiet is to pray, not for your concerns, but however the Lord leads
How does the enemy know what is on our conscience, and how do we know that he has put something into our mind?
To be right with God under the Old Testament, one had to take care of both the law of commandments and the prophets
In the New Testament the law of life replaces the law of commandments, and the anointing replaces the prophets
Both could be considered as the Lord's speaking, but actually the law of life is rather a principle, giving us a certain taste
If a child has a heavy cold, when you put something into his mouth he may not be able to tell whether it is sweet or bitter
If we contact the Lord through prayer and His Word, we shall have a proper, holy fear lest we offend Him by disobedience
How can we determine which things need the attention of the elders and which things we should not pass on any further?
We need to know where the saints are spiritually, so that we can get their help or supply some nourishment to them
If all the saints would exercise in this way, the church would be healthy, having all its weaknesses taken care of
Do not give out or seek to get any information except what will enable you to supply others or be supplied by them
The church will grow be built up in a healthy way and be spared the killing that comes from knowing what we do not need to know about others
The Father is a husbandman, a farmer, cultivating the true vine, Christ, with its branches, the believers in Christ
We, as the branches of the true vine, must see that the Father, the husbandman, does not want us to do any work
We shall be saved many times from thinking or speaking something other than the one thing if we see that God is only cultivating this vine
In verse 7 the Lord says, 'If My words abide in you,' and in verse 26 He says, 'I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality'
According to my experience, there is no other way to live, grow, and produce Christ, except by receiving the Word and by touching the Spirit
When you come to touch the Lord and to touch His Word, you should realize that your condition is not what it should be
You may say to others that everything is all right, but there will be a question within, 'Are you sure you are all right?
Because we are still living in our natural man, in the flesh, whenever we come to God we need the trespass offering or the sin offering
Take a short nap, then kneel down, open the Word, and begin to read, pray-read, study, and search for half an hour or so
It will kill your natural concepts about your husband or wife, about the brothers and sisters, about the church and the elders
In contrast, if you try to exercise the spirit in reading the Los Angeles Times, there will be no inward response
Every time you come to the Bible, in the name and under the blood, something inside works in coordination with what you are reading outside
With the Word occupying and saturating your mind and the Spirit dwelling in your spirit, you will live, grow, and produce Christ
It is like the food we take in; we may finish a meal in thirty minutes, but for several hours afterward that food sustains us
The writings of the Apostle John are in three categories- the Gospel, the three Epistles, and the book of Revelation
John 15 does not refer to teachings, gifts, and organization, though these are what Christianity requires for its existence and spreading
We were born and raised in an environment that has encouraged us to teach, organize, use our gifts, and take action
If we add John 1:4, 'In Him was life,' to the description of Him in John 1:1 as the Word, we have the term used here, the Word of life
The words which was with the Father and was manifested unto us again indicate that eternal life is nothing less than Jesus Christ Himself
The word translated 'declare' means to hand over, not just to show you my hymn book, for example, but also to hand it over to you
We hand this eternal life over to others that they may have fellowship with us, with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ
The difference is that in the Gospel they are objective, whereas in the Epistles the reality of these words is within us
Verse 6 continues, 'If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth'
If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood cleanses us from all sin
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
The final verse in 1 John 1 says, 'If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us'
If we are in the fellowship, we shall be fearful and trembling in the realization that we not only have sin but that we are also sinning
If it is during the night that the light comes, you can tell the Lord you will make things right with your wife first thing in the morning
Gradually your ability to understand and interpret spiritual things will develop; this will give the anointing the means to speak to you
Right away exercise your faith to take the Word, which says that if we confess, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
When we use the term vision, we do not mean the strange seeing of something that the Pentecostalists refer to as a vision
You try to keep on making your plans, but the sense comes, 'This is not the branch living the vine, growing the vine, and producing the vine
Now the sense of pleasure is gone, and a bothering has come, causing you to reduce, even stop, what you have been doing
Do not think this is a repetition of what you have already confessed; it is that you must complete your unfinished confession
When you have a little feeling that you have touched the Lord's mercy even in confessing by knowledge, go on to the confession by life
The phrase in Acts 11:18, 'repentance unto life,' can be translated 'repentance issuing in, or resulting in, life'
The next morning, though, when you are about to talk to your wife and say something negative about the brothers, you are stopped by fear
It also says that if we walk in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus cleanses
When you really want to repent but feel that you are just in the area of knowledge, how do you get from knowledge into life?
Spurgeon was once invited by the manager of a newly built theater to go there for an open house to preach the gospel
The manager told Spurgeon that if he had gone to preach the gospel in the theater, its business would have flourished
There is an atmosphere in the meeting hall that constrains you to pray and praise even as you are walking up the stairs
When 1 John 2:27 says the anointing 'teacheth you of all things,' it implies that the anointing is related to the Bible
Without laying a firm foundation in God's Word, you have no way to interpret what the anointing is speaking to you
We must stay with the Word till it becomes the Spirit through our spiritual breathing, that is, our prayerful reading, of it
You will never regret being legal about reading the Word, but you will surely regret being loose in your daily living
You will find that the more you abide in Christ, the more you experience His death and participate in His resurrection
The spirit we release should not be mixed with our natural ability, our flesh, our self, or anything else of the old creation
On the positive side, you will also experience the resurrection, and your release of the spirit will be without any mixture
If anything of the old still remains, it becomes an insulation between Christ and you, making your abiding superficial
Abiding in Christ in a thorough way depends upon a thorough killing, carried out by the Word and executed by the Spirit
If you have only a superficial knowledge of the New Testament, you may think that its pages contain just stories and teachings
If you have the experience of death, you do not need to understand resurrection; it is the complement of death
Gaining this knowledge will give you a solid foundation for life and will enrich the nourishment you receive from your morning reading
What is the difference between being legal with oneself to get into the Word whether one feels like it or not, and Christian behavior?
Because the Bible is the word of our God, when we come to it we have the sense, even before we read it, that we are coming to God Himself
Do you not think that giving that time to what the world thinks will have a negative, worldly influence on your behavior?
Even though the United States is so democratic, once you are in the military service, even the length of your hair is regulated
It would please us so much if our grandchildren came to visit us just because they loved us, not for any other purpose
In His presence, because He is light, we see our faults, spontaneously make confession, and are cleansed by the blood
To go to the Lord with the purpose of confessing, on the other hand, may result in several minutes of frustration
Some of us have seen the need for physical exercise and have started jogging, or playing tennis, volleyball, or softball
Can you help us have the proper attitude toward taking care of our body and yet, on the other hand, be preserved from the world of sports?
In this crooked perverse generation sports and entertainment lead many people into sin and are in fact their means of fulfilling their lusts
As we said in the previous message, the spices of the compound ointment are the constituents of the Word as well as of the Spirit
Both contain corrections and adjustments, but in the Bible those corrections and adjustments contain a killing element
Suppose you come home from work tired out, and as soon as you step into the house, something provokes you to be annoyed with your wife
The word of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness; but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God'
Would you not be offended to be told that you are not spiritual, that you are a man of flesh, that you are just an infant in Christ?
The Bible is composed of these two kinds of words-the word of the cross which kills and the word of life which brings resurrection
For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh
Although we may not understand how death and life do their work, we get the benefit by daily coming to the Word
When verse 14 mentions being led by the Spirit, it is referring to our being led to put to death the practices of the body
By experiencing the killing of the flesh, the self, and the natural man, we abide in Christ and enjoy the resurrection also
Before we consider how the Word can bring us into life, we shall answer some questions based on the previous message
From the verse before and the verse after, it seems that if our behavior is proper, God will sanctify us wholly and preserve us blameless
Sanctification is surely a matter of life, but both sanctification and life will keep us away from all negative things
For the sake of others and for your own sake, you must be careful; behind every appearance of evil, evil is lurking
Even if the Apostle Paul were to come and contradict his writings in the New Testament, we would have to reject him
If you take in the Word, the Word will become the Spirit to show you your pride and then to live out Christ instead of pride
The best way to set your mind on the Spirit is to get into the Word; this will release you from your distracting, disturbing thoughts
In human society today, chaos would prevail were it not for the restraints of ethical teachings, the police, and the law courts
It is better for the single brothers to live by themselves in a brothers' house and for the young single sisters to have a sisters' house
He spoke with Nicodemus privately at night , but when he spoke to the Samaritan woman , it was under the sun in the open air
Before you go into such a situation, you must be clear that you go there just for the gospel's sake, for no other purpose
Sometimes we are not willing to obey what the Lord touches in us; this unwillingness may persist for three or four years
Does not the rest of the verse say, 'and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness'?
In 1 Peter 2:2 the Word is referred to as milk: 'As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby'
These, then, are the ways to take the Word: taste it, breathe it, eat it, drink it as milk, and take it in as solid food
The Word is likened to rain in summer and snow in winter watering us to produce the seed for fruitbearing and the bread for our satisfaction
As we are daily in the Word, the Word gets into us and saturates us subjectively and dispositionally with the divine essence
If we are reading on abiding, our prayer must be on abiding; if the Word is on righteousness, our prayer should be about righteousness
Like a camel about to make a long journey through the desert, you will store a great deal of nourishment within you and so be helped to grow
With all these legalities-eating, breathing, drinking, and sleeping-there is a need for us to exercise a strong will
If we are to keep these legalities and the commandments in the New Testament, we need to ask the Lord to strengthen our will
If the Lord wants us to help some of these dear ones, He will give us a burden, prepare the situation, and afford us the opportunity
Submission is surely against your conscience if it leads you to worship an idol or to do something against the truth
Daniel and his three friends are an example of submission at the highest level, yet they did not defile themselves
Her way of handling the situation was to lock the door and not let him in till he had been knocking for an hour or so
We have put forth much effort, yet our fruit-bearing has been meager; this indicates there has not been much living of Christ
Which do you think you will regret in the age to come-attending boring meetings or not attending the meetings?
Have you ever received grace by staying away from the meetings, by going to the beach, by watching television, or by engaging in sports?
In a similar way, when you come to the Bible, you have the sweet consciousness that you are coming to your God, your Father, your Lord
To take the Word and to touch the Spirit in this way is to abide in the vine and to enjoy all the riches of the Triune God as your portion
Besides legally getting into the Word and legally spending time in prayer, we also need to legally take care of our conscience
You may be reading Romans 12, for example, and come to verse 5 where it says that we are 'members one of another'
When you want to reason about church matters or why the elders behave as they do, remember you are forbidden to do so by this commandment
Some have even said that we should not control ourselves but just let some flesh come forth and do whatever it pleases
Whatever your age, however long you have been in Christ, if you do not exercise restrictions over your flesh, you are capable of any evil
Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens'
According to our experience, however, we find that, in spite of our efforts and good intentions, unconsciously we slip out of Him
If you feel excited when you first start getting into the Word and feel there is light shining, don't have regard for that feeling
They would put the rice into a basket made of willow branches and then repeatedly immerse the whole basket in the water
By continuing to read the Word, this sister would be getting washed even though she couldn't remember what she had read
As time goes on, the sugar will be reduced, and eventually the sweet taste in the Word and in the hymns will be gone
After we have been sitting in the meeting for a short while, the merciful God may visit us, touch our heart, and cause the tears to flow
How Christ could be both the first item of the creation and also its Creator, the One in whom all things were created, we cannot comprehend
That all things consist by Him means that He holds everything together the way the hub of a wheel holds all its spokes together
We should not live American or Chinese; we should not live old folks or young people; we should all live Christ
The Bible is not a book of ethics, teaching you to love rather than hate; its message is that we should live Christ
Please be assured that God does not want your kindness and gentleness any more than He wanted your crudeness and toughness
Buy an alarm clock if you need one to help you to get up early enough to set aside at least ten minutes for the Word
Our anxieties will be replaced by joy when we read the Word; it is a medicine to heal us of our tensions and worries
If you are taking a course in school, you must study the textbook in order to pass; if possible, study the reference books too
In the past few years, some saints have had only a corporate morning watch; when they come to pray-read alone, they don't know what to do
Many meetings we may feel we have not received anything, but nonetheless we are getting the benefit every time
Such a cycle is repeated until gradually the dependence on feelings is gone; there is no mountaintop and no valley
If you have eaten well, but you still feel hungry for some enjoyment of music or a good time, which life is hungry?
In this New Testament age, whenever we touch the Spirit of God, we touch the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ
You may remember the meaning of the spices that were added to the hin of oil; we discussed this in Life Message Eight
Cassia is an aromatic plant, used in ancient times to repel insects and especially snakes; it represents the sweet fragrance of resurrection
In this ointment portraying the Spirit are the death of Christ His resurrection His divinity His humanity the trinity and the Godhead
His book, The Highest Learning, aims at developing the natural virtues, even the conscience, which he terms 'the bright virtue'
You may protest that the Lord is killing such desirable qualities but these must be dealt with until eventually you yourself are also killed
Day by day we must contact the Word and touch the Spirit; both do the same work of killing us and then resurrecting us
In some of the churches an atmosphere has come in encouraging the young people just to have a good time- singing, shouting, playing guitars
Romans 7 is referring to the overcoming of sin; we are talking about a necessity of life, like breathing or eating
If we emphasize loving rather than being watchful, we may be able to help a brother who shows signs of being divisive
As members of the church, we should be keen to sense if there are some brothers who are subtly and secretly divisive
Because we want to cover and preserve them, we may in a loving tone hint to them that some are aware of their divisive intent
When a member of our body is sick, we must tenderly care for that part, seeking the best medication or even an operation to heal it
If you have the insight and the wisdom, you will keep tabs on him, watching his movements and his contacts with different ones
As the Lord leads, you may have a hidden opportunity to say some 'inoculating' words to help heal him of his 'illness'
When you come to visit, for example, shouldn't everyone be invited to meet with you instead of just the important ones?
Whatever the state of the church- whether there are two levels or twenty-two levels-you should have no criticism and nothing to say
Boys four years old can't be trusted to cook a meal; they may make a mess even if you ask them only to empty the trash!
As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ'
By reading the New Testament you can see that even in the time of the Apostle Paul confusion had begun to creep in
Only something attractive like this could have gained an entrance into the church, which is on the highest level
At the end of the first century, then, the so-called church had within it Christ, Judaism, and Greek philosophy
The result of these Christological studies, on such a seemingly good scriptural topic, was actual division, no longer just confusion
From this time on there was the Church of England the Church of Germany and a national church in most of the northern European countries
Not too long after these were formed, private churches, like the Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist, came into existence
The Lord must have something other than Christianity, apart from its denominations, if He is to have His Body built and His Bride prepared
Do you see that the Lord is out to recover His church from confusion and division, back to Himself and back to oneness?
Anything other than Christ, even something as good as Judaism, Greek philosophy, or the study of Christ, is a factor of confusion
If we would preserve the Lord's recovery from contamination, we must turn away from our concepts and come back simply to Christ
Are two concepts being spread among the saints: attending the meetings regularly is religious; going early to the meetings is legal
That neighbor bided his time till the house was finished, then went to the gentleman and told him about the house's improper location
Was a house designed and built exactly according to its owner's plan, yet he lost it because it was on the wrong ground
Anything other than Christ, however much we treasure it, we leave outside, because bringing in something besides Him will cause division
There will be no confusion and no division if we have regard for only these two things: Christ as life and the oneness
Some may shout, some may sleep, but you just enjoy the Lord and praise Him no matter how foreign the meeting is to your taste
In the previous Life Message we pointed out that the church is built with Christ as life and with oneness as its ground
Any movement, any direction, or any speaking that leads to a hierarchy is an insult to the headship of Christ; as such it must be rejected
By practicing the truth in this way, each local church will be safeguarded from fluctuating and be kept to the one goal
After a certain time, however, his environment did not supply his material needs, and he resumed his occupation of tentmaker
To bring to the Lord what we propose and ask His blessing on it, as is the common practice in Christianity, is an insult to His headship
If what is spoken is checked out by every saint and by the church to see that it is according to the truth, we shall be kept from falsehood
When something is bothering us and we want to take that to the Lord, that is not the same as going to the Lord with a purpose, is it?
Though we say the church has none, there are practical matters to be taken care of and relationships to be worked out
The elders should be careful about claiming to express His headship; they do not have even an indirect share in that headship
When his name is mentioned with the other Apostles in the Gospels or in the first part of Acts, it is always first
Paul, who was younger in the faith, rebuked him to the face for this failure to walk according to the truth of the gospel
It was Barnabas who brought in Saul and whose name was mentioned first when they were called by the Holy Spirit to the work
Peter underscored this in his first Epistle: 'Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock'
Whenever a sheep went astray, the shepherds would order one of the sheep dogs after it to bring it back into line
If there is some cleaning to be done, for example, the elders should take the lead to do it, not ask others to take care of it
The one who was up last week may be fighting with his wife this week, and the leadership may pass to another elder
An elder may have ability in a certain area; he will take the lead in that, while in another area another elder will be responsible
If Peter had been an official leader, he might have introduced a wrong concept about Judaism during his time of weakness
We are to obey the leading ones in serving, but this does not make the leading ones lords, having rank over the saints
Regions of the work exist today in Brazil, Germany, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia
In the United States also there are regions of the work where churches have been raised up: Ohio and Texas are examples
When we read the Scripture which tells us to deny our self, our natural response is to determine to put our self aside
If you will go to the Lord for ten minutes every morning and read the Word, you will be nourished and your life will become shining
Is it good to practice releasing our spirit in the meetings even if we may be in our emotions and full of self?
Just as our human life requires that we eat drink sleep and breathe so for our spiritual life we must contact the Lord and take in His Word
The result will be transformation, not by any outward doing, but by the life supply dispensed into us from within
It would especially benefit you to go through Matthew John Romans Galatians Ephesians Philippians Colossians Hebrews 1 John and Revelation
Further, when you come around to read it the next time, or the third time, you will find that it is less and less dry
Your study of the Scriptures will be helped by referring to other books too, especially the recovery books that we have printed
We are here because we have the same Spirit, flowing in us just as electricity flows to the lights in the ceiling and unites them in shining
After three days He was resurrected from the dead and ascended to the heavens, where He now is as our Redeemer, Savior, and Lord
Some need to study the Word in a thorough way, so that in time to come they may be able to teach and shepherd in the church
Follow in knowledge and experience, that we may 'grow up into him in all things' until we arrive at 'a full-grown man'
We are one not because we have common concepts, similar interests, and the same goal, nor because we are doing the same kind of work
Christians do not have the genuine oneness because they are not living in Him, though positionally they are in Him
The glory that the Father gave the Son, the Son has given to the believers for the very purpose of their all being one
Most of the time, we must admit, we are in ourselves-in our choice, our preference, our flesh, in jealousy, hatred, or pride
While we may be aware that we need to be in the genuine oneness, we cannot attain this because we do not live in the Triune God
There were even some dear Christian co-workers on the mainland of China who went out from us to set up a division
If you are not in fear and trembling to live in Him day after day, the time may come when you too will cause a division
If our goal is anything other than the expression of the Triune God, sooner or later this other goal will cause division
Even a small group, after it meets together for just two or three years, will end up divided into perhaps three groups
Because they care for these things and not for the expression of God, the genuine oneness is not secure with them
The Lord's prayer about the oneness reached a further stage in John 17:23: 'I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one'
You may say you are one with others, but your oneness is shallow because you are still so natural, so full of the flesh, so selfish
In contrast to Christianity, it is not an organization built upon certain concepts, but an entity with Christ as its content and nature
He quits his secular studies and goes to a so-called theological seminary where he is indoctrinated with modernism
The third one starts attending a Baptist church and becomes persuaded that immersion as practiced by the Baptists is the only right kind
The other 'children' need their 'toys' too, whether modernistic teachings, insistence on immersion, or speaking in tongues
To have a name, to have a special teaching, and to have a restricted fellowship are the characteristics of a sect
Many Christians choose to hold on to their divisive name, their special doctrine, or their particular fellowship
Some have tried to bring tongues-speaking into the church, but if we become a tongues-speaking church we become a sect
When we came into the recovery, many of us dropped our particular teachings in order to share the common oneness with the saints
Let us answer some questions before we consider together our behavior in the house of God, which is the church
If someone in the church stands up and preaches that we should worship Satan, everyone, even the youngest sister, should rise up to protest
It is true that we do not want to be rebellious and disobedient; we are not out to make trouble or cause turmoil
In order for us to behave properly in the house of God, we must realize that God has made Christ Head over all things to the church
In God's administration there was a specific time when this inauguration of Christ into the headship of the universe occurred
It is clear from Peter's words on the day of Pentecost that this enthronement took place at the time of Christ's ascension
God in His administration wanted a man to exercise His judgment; it was not His will to deal with the enemy directly
During the time of the Old Testament Christ had not yet been incarnated; He was Son of God, but not Son of Man
For Christ to be the fully qualified Head He could not be just God; He had to have the human nature as well as the divine
As not to lower His status as Creator, God must use man, another of His creatures, to defeat the creature Satan, His enemy
What we are touching here is not a doctrinal matter but a truth, for the seeing of which we need to have our inner eyes enlightened
Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ'
Let us exult that a man has been exalted to the throne, a man from a small country village in the despised district of Galilee
Most of you realize that there is no more need to organize the church than there is a need to organize the physical body
It is a basic principle that organization leads to hierarchy, a leadership having one rank subordinate to the next
When we meet together, one will call for a hymn, some others may pray, and then there may be a testimony or requests for more hymns
To behave rightly in the house of God also requires that we receive our orders directly from Christ, without any intermediary
The law as we all realize was scriptural it had been given by God to Moses and had been taught for centuries during the Old Testament times
The four Gospels present Christ from four different angles; the words and style of writing are different, but the ministry is the same
He would have been speaking of Moses and the law, whereas Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were speaking of Jesus Christ
It is clear from Ephesians 4:11 and 12 that the gifted persons mentioned all had only one ministry, that of building up the Body of Christ
The four Gospels are indeed different from each other, but only in that they present different aspects of the same thing
In this New Testament time the twelve Apostles Paul and Barnabas Martin Luther Watchman Nee and all of us have been constituted into the Son
Timothy 1 tells us that besides the teachers of the law, some were speaking 'fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions'
The fables and genealogies are part of the Old Testament things concerning the law; they are either tradition or opinion
Suppose a brother comes among us and begins to rebuke the churches in the recovery for their failure to practice foot-washing
The Lord Jesus Himself set us an example of this in John 13 and specifically told us that we ought to wash one another's feet
We can be sure that foot-washing, even though it is found in the New Testament, is not part of God's economy because it ministers questions
Another brother in his studies of the New Testament may come to the conclusion that grape juice not wine should be used at the Lords table
Suppose, after the breaking of bread, he should give a message exhorting us to use grape juice instead of wine
We could further add that the Lord, in Matthew 26:29, did not use the term wine but rather 'the fruit of the vine'
The church is the pillar and base of the truth ; as such, all of us must be clear about the truth of the headship of Christ
Among us these past few years there have been indications that we too do not see the significance of Christ's headship
If we think that a church needs elders because that is the way it is set up in the Scriptures, we are in the realm of doctrine
When we meet together in the Spirit, God is manifested among us; this is the manifestation of God in the flesh
Paul exhorted Timothy to pray for those 'that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty'
If we are godly it will affect the choice of pictures we hang in our bedroom the kind of clothes we wear our hair style and our conversation
The term healthy is another word which recurs throughout the two Epistles to Timothy and in Titus as well; it is usually translated 'sound'
We may not know very much, but our taste can distinguish what is sweet, what is bitter, what is poisonous, and what is healthy
In a time of degradation, then, we must be centered on God's economy and not be distracted by those who teach differently
Finally, our behavior in the house of God includes discerning and receiving, as well as ministering, 'healthy words'
He came into your spirit , not into your heart, though you may have sung that well-known chorus, 'Into My Heart'
When Christ has spread into all the inward parts around our spirit, He will then have made His home in our hearts
Every day the first thing you should do is to take five, ten, or fifteen minutes to worship the Lord and to contact Him
Don't be preoccupied in the meeting, thinking how wonderful the message is but what will you do when you get to the office tomorrow
The Lord's recovery has spread, not only throughout the United States, but also to Europe, South America, Africa, and Australasia
We are branches of the vine, branching out the very Christ, not by our plans or activities, but just by our living
It may be that, as you spontaneously seek His leading, you will have a burden to say a word to someone concerning the Lord; if so, do it
Without any decision, schedule, or plan, these clusters come forth, according to the inner life of the branches
We need to be clear that Christ today is not just far away in the third heaven He is now also the lifegiving Spirit residing in our spirit
Such a statement may seem abstract, because we are used to finding ways, or planning activities, to get things accomplished
Some of us may think that the way to preach the gospel is to use musical instruments or to have a quartet sing some gospel songs
With little effort on your part, perhaps just your suggestion that you pray together, that person will be saved
Such will not be the case with those who are brought in through the use of gimmicks; most of them will not stay
We live as a witness, a testimony, to Him; this testimony will gradually bring others whom we know to know Him also
You may think you are the most humble one in your family, that all your brothers and sisters are proud and stubborn
All your efforts to love your wife, to be submissive to your husband, to control your temper, and to be kind are in vain
When there is a need to share a certain aspect of the experience of Christ, we shall be able to give a testimony along that line
Such a teaching comes into the church in a time of degradation, when some will turn 'the grace of our God into lascivious-ness'
When the Scripture says that we are not under law, it is referring to the law given by Moses; it is plain that we are not under that law
We Christians must be a speaking people, addressing not only God, but also angels, demons, and even the atmosphere
Coming to the meetings is good; listening to the messages is good; but the reading, studying, and eating of the Bible is a life necessity
If they raise a doctrinal point, we can steer away from it and give instead a testimony of our experience of Christ
Our relatives not only need such a verbal testimony from us; they also need to see such a testimony lived before them
Once you have taken His words into you and are actually one with Him and He with you, there will be a consciousness deep within you
When the cook protested that he was a good man and had never sinned, the missionary began to talk to him about a horse
The cook needed a new horse, and the missionary's description of the horse aroused in the cook longings to have such an excellent one
The missionary then called to his attention what such thoughts indicated, and the cook was forced to admit they were signs of covetousness
Sometimes you would even lie to your mother, telling her you were going to the library when actually you were sneaking off to the movies
Upon your return home, if she asked you what you had been studying in the library, you would invent a little story for her
There will be something within bothering you; you will feel disturbed both for going to the movies and also for deceiving your mother
No matter how much you say you are liberated from all bondage, you cannot be liberated from the inner law written upon your heart
Whenever you do something against God and this living law within, you will have the sense that you are not right
After we are saved, God's law is written on our hearts and we are 'not without law to God, but under the law to Christ'
Only in this Epistle is the church called 'the church of the living God' and 'the pillar and base of the truth'
It will help us to know how to behave in the house of God if we consider these two words, 'living' and 'truth'
The tables were turned upside down, dirty socks were scattered around, shoes were in the sink, and the chairs were knocked over
You concluded that the people were either dead or kidnapped, but when you checked in the bedroom, there they were in bed sick
If not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up'
That is why the king called him the 'servant of the living God' and proclaimed that 'the God of Daniel is the living God'
Paul warned the elders of the church in Ephesus, 'After my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock
In the New Testament the truth, or the reality, came through Jesus Christ, who Himself told us, 'I am the truth'
She raised all her children in Christianity, teaching us Bible stories and insisting that we attend Southern Baptist Sunday morning services
Paul uses several descriptive terms which indicate the direction some at Ephesus were taking away from the truth
In verse 23 he further admonishes Timothy, 'But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes'
There were those who had turned back to the law; who were giving heed to fables and endless genealogies; who were tattlers and busybodies
It was to correct such a deplorable situation that Paul wrote these Epistles, in which he emphasized so strongly the matter of the truth
These positive terms are a reminder to us that, for the church to serve as the pillar and base of the truth, we must take in the Word of God
The Lord Jesus said, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
Though we introduced this term about ten years ago, the prayerful reading of the Word has been practiced by many saints of old
By staying in this pure air and deep breathing, we shall be kept from the noxious fumes of fables, vain jangling, and perverse disputings
But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness'
Flee also youthful lusts: but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
As His living children, we must rise up to protest and reject these efforts to draw us away from God's economy
What a strong testimony we must be for the truth, that all may see that the church is in very fact the pillar and base of the truth!
In John 14:6 Jesus said, 'I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me'
Unlike redemption, the significance of this picture of Christ as a grain of wheat is not understood by most Christians
Nothing less than this inward and outward mingling of ourselves and Christ as the wonderful allinclusive Spirit constitutes the church life
Now that we have considered how Christ is life to us, we shall refer to 1 Corinthians to show how Christ can be the reality to us
Have you ever realized that your life is like a corporation, and that Christ is both your capital and your wisdom?
The water of baptism signifies not only the death of Christ but also Christ Himself as the realm in which we have been placed
The change that has taken place in our conduct before God and man is evidence that Christ is the reality of righteousness in our life
We can use our attitude toward shopping as an illustration of the distinction between righteousness and sanctification
Before we were saved, if we could take something from the store without paying for it, we were pleased with ourselves for not getting caught
After we were saved, not only would we not steal, but even if we were given too much change we would return it
The Lord within stops talking, not because He approves, but in order not to press you too far when you are so young
Christ, then, has taken care of these three stages of our Christian life, as well as these three aspects of our daily experience
God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God'
The Passover reminds us that formerly we were under God's condemnation but that God has forgiven us, passed over us, through Christ
The sisters cannot take their husband as their head without first positioning themselves to take Christ as the Head
For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ'
As He spreads into our inner being and makes His home there, He becomes our reality as well as our life, and we are no longer empty
My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of spirit and of power'
Rather than demonstrating a clever mind or eloquent words, he was with the Corinthians in weakness, fear, and much trembling
When the Lord Jesus began His ministry around the age of thirty, His first public act was to be baptized by John
He could see how sinners like the Pharisees and Sadducees needed to be baptized but how could this One born of the Holy Spirit need baptism
But Jesus answering said to him, Permit it now, for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness'
A careful study of the Gospels will reveal that the whole earthly life of the Lord Jesus was under the death of the cross
Hebrews 10:20 tells us that a new and living way has been dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh
Such experiences are possible because in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, and as such He indwells us
That is why the Psalmist said, 'By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth'
You cannot say from this that the Bible is God, even though the Bible is God's Word and the Word is God Himself
If you are asked by a learned professor where Christ is, do not reply that He is in the heavens; that is too far away
The writings of Confucius are of a high quality, with profound philosophical and ethical teachings, but they cannot compare with the Bible
By eating different forms of the animal and vegetable life, we get the essential elements we need to sustain our physical life
From such verses we can see that God would impart Himself into us as nourishment, that our spiritual being might be constituted
He said, 'I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life'
Just as the apostles spoke in the Son, so our speaking today is the Son's speaking because we are one with Him and members of His Body
If we neglect this book, however wonderful our initial experience of salvation was, we shall find that we are not properly saved
He had neither the sweet book of Isaiah, nor the mysterious Zechariah, nor the marvelous book of Daniel, nor the unveiling book of Ezekiel
Without realizing it, you will be cleansed by reading this Word, and God, the very essence of the Word, will be imparted to you
We may not understand the Word that we pray-read, but eventually we shall find that it has been light, life, and even the anointing to us
If we summarize how this Word benefits us as it nourishes, waters, and sustains us, we can say that it adds God into us
In 1900 the Boxer Rebellion had caused the martyrdom of many missionaries, mostly English; this episode constrained many to pray for China
From our study of the Bible and our seeking of the Lord, we came to realize that our living should be different
As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become the children of God, to those who believe in His name'
In the case of Christ and the church, also, there is only one life; what Christ has as life is what the church has as life
When they take Christ as their life, in the wife submission will come forth, and in the husband love will arise
John says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
The Son took the Fathers life not because of any sin or weakness or inadequacy on the Sons part but just to accomplish the Fathers desire
If the cross had not been the Father's will, if saving sinners had not been the Father's will, Christ would not have submitted to the cross
If you keep praying this way, you will become clear that in the Christian life the Lord and you have only one life
If we pray this way, we may sense that the Lord is pleased -pleased that He has a life for us and that we have a living for Him
If you are after a position for yourself, when you come to the Word the help you receive will be fragmentary at best
As you practice living by Christ, you will see how different you are from those in the world, who have only their own life
He would need to love her, and she would need to submit to him, in order that they might be a good example to all the future human couples
For all these relationships he would need to develop a good character and show kindness, humility, and patience
The second crucial point, then, is that we have only God and Satan to choose between for the source of our supply
It is the human concept of religion that promotes doing-worship, good behavior, proper relationships with others
Man was not given the divine life when he was created; rather, he was given a free will to choose that life, symbolized by the tree of life
From these verses we may infer that the tree of life is one of the outstanding features of the eternal blessing
Do not lose sight of God's intention for man as represented by this tree: God wants you to take Him as your life
The tree of life signifies the Prince, the Originator, the Author, of life- Jesus Christ, God Himself, as our life
It was to make this point that the Lord Jesus in chapter six talked so much about Himself as 'the true bread out of heaven'
He said, 'I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes in Me shall by no means ever thirst
For this is the will of My Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life
The Spirit of life refers to the Spirit of God, while the Word of life reminds us that this life can be found in the Bible, the Word of God
To live on the words that proceed from God's mouth is to live by Christ, for He is the living Word out of the mouth of God
Exodus means departure, and in this second book of the Bible we find the way to get out of the coffin and out of Egypt
Today we too have a free entry into the shelter through the redeeming blood of Christ and are under the covering of His blood
To be strengthened to leave Egypt the Israelites had to do more than sprinkle the blood over their door entrance
Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof'
The Israelites were to 'eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it'
Once they were full of this rich meal of lamb, unleavened bread, and bitter herbs, they would be energized to march out of Egypt
The effect of eating Christ as the bitter herbs is the bitter sense you have whenever you touch something sinful
If you go to a movie or criticize your motherinlaw or even think negatively about her you will sense the bitter herbs working within you
Once the children of Israel were out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, they praised the Lord by singing and even dancing
Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances'
These varied foods that came out of the water or out of the soil of Egypt were enjoyed not only by the Israelites and the Egyptians
Even you may have wearied of a constant diet of messages week after week and turned to the foods that Egypt had to offer
Rather than hearing about Christ and the church in message after message, some have promoted more entertaining meetings
Guitar playing, special singing, joking, and emotional stirrings are like leeks, onions, and garlic from Egypt's soil
In verse 31 the manna is said to be 'like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey'
Consider how much light you have received since you came into the church and began receiving Christ as the manna
In addition to preparing and eating it, they first built the tabernacle and then carried it all during their journey
We should build up the church to be the dwelling place of God and then carry it as His testimony wherever we go
In the previous message on the tree of life, we pointed out that God's intention from the beginning was to be taken into man as food
The book of Exodus, then, again reminds us that God's intention for man is to be his life, received in the form of food
Full salvation includes redemption, regeneration with the life and nature of God, and deliverance from the world
The eating of the manna is not for our salvation but for the building of God's dwelling place and the carrying on of God's testimony
The temple was built in the good land, and it meant that the kingdom of God was established, expressing God and His authority
You may feel that even in one day your experience can shift back and forth from the good land to Egypt or to the wilderness
While manna was the only food provided for the children of Israel in the wilderness, the produce of the good land was varied
From chapters twelve, fourteen, and sixteen of Deuteronomy it is clear that there were two kinds of eating in the good land
Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock
If this same cow has a second calf, though, we are free to fatten it up, kill it, and make a feast for all our relatives
In the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days'
The habitation of God today is the church, and Mount Zion is today's church meeting, where the tithes and offerings are to be presented
Eating Christ in the third stage involves not only His riches but also the matter of the oneness of God's people
Once the children of Israel occupied the good land, it would have been easy for them to be separate from each other
Though most of the time they avoided each other, the day would come when they would both have to make the journey back to Jerusalem
If we try to have both the common and the particular portions of Christ in the place where we choose, the oneness is damaged
The children of Israel had to till the soil, sow the seed, keep the ground watered, and get rid of damaging insects
The Lord's reply was, 'An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father
It may be that sometimes our meetings will have no singing or even praying, but only rich testimonies from our daily life
The testimonies may be quite short, yet because they come from the riches in the spirit, they may be more than a testimony
Today we are still under the influence of degraded Christianity, with the singing of hymns and praying as part of our form of meeting
Because we all have such bountiful and varied experiences, what we say should follow the line of the one who preceded us
If our meetings are full of such an attractive Christ, those who come will be convinced, subdued, and captured
These three parables give us a threefold picture of God's seeking of man, with the last one the consummate one
The parable of the lost sheep tells how the shepherd leaves his ninety-nine sheep and goes in search of the one missing
As we pointed out in the previous message, it was not until the third stage of eating that the promised goal of God came into view
A son left his father, squandered his inheritance, and eventually found himself in the fields feeding pigs while he himself was starving
when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him'
How glad he must have been to hear his father add, 'And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry' !
Eating is the taking of something which is outside of you into you and then digesting it so that it becomes organically part of you
To hold such a thought is to be ignorant of God's economy, which is pictured for us so vividly in this parable
Romans 10:6-10 reminds us that we can find Christ, not in heaven or in the abyss, but nearby, in our mouth and in our heart
In contrast to the robe, the ring, and the shoes, which are visible, the calf is eaten and disappears from sight
You could not have grown by eating pearls or diamonds, because they are not food and your body could not have digested them
Notice that the complaint was not about the robe, the ring, or the shoes, but 'Thou hast killed for him the fatted calf'
Eventually the house was filled, not with them, but with the poor, the crippled, and even some who were compelled to attend
The oxen and the fatted beasts refer to Christ, who was killed that God's chosen people might enjoy Him as a feast
Notice how Christ portrays His coming, in both its first and second aspects, as a king's marriage feast for his son
We come together on the first day of the week to break bread and thus declare to the universe that we live by eating and drinking Christ
It is referred to as the Holy Communion, and there is no understanding of the meaning of the bread and the cup
There is a feast spread for God's chosen people, who reject it and thus open the door for the Gentiles to partake of it
By these parables and also in His explicit word , the Lord presented Himself as the true food given for the life of the world
By pray-reading this book you will be nourished by the rich Christ, and God will have a way to fulfill His purpose
The Apostle Paul prayed, 'That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God'
And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is'
We were born with only a human life; when the divine life is added into our being, transformation can be accomplished
When Paul wrote of how he had cared for the Corinthian believers, he said, 'I have fed you with milk, and not with meat'
There are verses which mention teaching and learning, but there is this concept here that the believers need to be fed
The more we behold and reflect Him, the more He comes into us and changes us, from one degree of glory to another
In 1 Peter 2:2 the believers were told to long for the Word the way an infant does for milk, 'that ye may grow thereby unto salvation'
At the end of the Bible, the food that is offered to God's people is the very food presented to man at the beginning
A portion of the manna, the food of the children of Israel in the wilderness, was preserved in a golden pot concealed in the ark
May we all be among those who seek the Lord, overcome the degradation of the worldly church, and enjoy Him as a special portion today
Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city'
In the writings of Paul, Peter, and John the thought keeps recurring that God's people must be fed rather than given doctrinal knowledge
He was earnestly following the traditions of his forefathers, who had for generations worshipped God according to the Old Testament
As he later described himself he was above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers
Those who believed in this new way were referred to by their opposers as 'the sect of the Nazarenes' , because of Jesus of Nazareth
Saul was enraged at the claims of this 'sect' and alarmed at the number of Jews who were being converted to it
While he was carrying out this self-assumed commission, he was suddenly confronted by that very Nazarene, calling to him by name from heaven
Someone who knew his name but whose name Saul did not know visited him from heaven causing him to fall to the earth trembling and astonished
The Greek word for persecute is the same as that translated 'follow after' and 'press' in Philippians 3:12 and 14
Before his heavenly encounter, Saul pursued Christ in hatred, with the intention of wiping Him out by destroying His followers
Afterwards, though, he said, 'I pursue toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus'
His whole mentality was focused in one direction, but when the light shined upon him and he fell to the ground, his course was turned around
Suppose he had simply gotten up again, determined to continue on his way and disregard the voice from the heavens
Determined we may be to press on in our own conviction, we cannot prevail against this One who speaks from the heavens
Though Saul was so well versed in the Old Testament with its commandments and outward ordinances, he did not see its central point
We may have seen a good many of its teachings, but the focus of the divine revelation, like our heart, is not easily seen
Too many Christians are running wild in their preoccupation with doctrinal matters or in their zeal to do things for God
In our early Christian experience, our repentance is for bad things, but later we shall find that our repentance is mostly for good things
Your thinking, your emotion, your intention, your motive, your quickness or your slowness-all these must be Christ
The revelation that came to him filled his writings; through them, under the heavenly enlightening, the same vision can be ours
We obey this vision by taking Him as our life, not allowing ourselves to be distracted by doctrines nor striving after good behavior
As we constantly talk to Him in prayer , we shall be spontaneously taking Him as our person and thus living according to the heavenly vision
By such seasons of enforced quiet the Lord reminded him to cease from his activities and just pray, leaving the work in the Lord's hands
You are left with nothing to do, because you realize that what you do in yourself is rebellion, even if it is seeking the Lord
God's intention is to have Christ thoroughly worked into your being, but in your spiritual seeking you have no concern about this
When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they were cut off from everything Egyptian and restricted to what was heavenly
Of all we must see that God wants only Christ, not our good works nor our good behavior nor even our spirituality
In our daily living some of us have jobs which keep our minds occupied the whole day; others have work which doesn't require concentration
Memorizing Bible verses is good, but it is better to have that happen in a spontaneous way, while you are praying over them
Now, 'enjoying Christ' and 'practicing the church life'-another term we introduced-have come into common usage
The main gatherings were three times a year: for the Passover, for the feast of weeks, and for the feast of tabernacles
They came together with the rich produce, not to kneel down, nor prostrate themselves, nor sing a hymn, nor offer a prayer
Rather, they offered the top ten percent of their increase to God and then ate together what they had offered to God in His presence
The feasts lasted seven days, and part of the time was spent hearing the teaching of the law, which corresponds to today's ministry
For the ministry, when the church is strong, there should be some local teachers, just as there were in Antioch
Our meetings need the balance between the eating in fellowship by the offering of our experiences and the teaching
According to the Bible, sufferings are not as bad as they seem; rather, they are a great blessing under a poor cloak
With us no circumstance is bad; even the worst environment is good, because God causes all things to work together for our good
He 'predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
We were 'predestinated according to the purpose of the One Who operates all things according to the counsel of His will'
To the scientists the earth is a small planet, not particularly outstanding in relation to the other heavenly bodies
If you read the first chapter of Genesis a few times, you will notice how often it says, 'And God saw that it was good'
On the sixth day, the day that man was created, 'God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good'
How regrettable it is that the glorious fact of the incarnation has been corrupted into the Christmas celebration
He asked the two on the road to Emmaus, 'Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory'?
Without the earth and man, there could not have been the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of the Son of God
When He came into us the meaning of the earth of man of the incarnation of the crucifixion and of the resurrection all became our portion
The Son revealed in us has brought us into the meaning of the earth, of man, and of the incarnate, crucified, and resurrected Lord
In that day God will be beside Himself with excitement and will call us to Satan's attention: 'Satan, look at My children!
The creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God
By the time God called him at the age of eighty, he was just a country shepherd, all his might 'in words and in deeds' far behind him
Deuteronomy 33 gives the 'blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death'
James 1:18 says, 'Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures'
If the wife refuses to keep her head covered in her married life, the result may well be separation or divorce
There will be peace in the family and peace in the church if we have the grace to put aside our will and our glory
Why is it that you have been seeking the Lord and meeting with the saints for so many years and yet have so little growth in life?
The reason you are defeated and have become so worldly and sinful is that you are so much in your will and your glory
Our humanity is a restriction, just as the resurrection life in the Lord Jesus was restrained when He was in the flesh
We which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh
As we live this crucified life in resurrection, day by day this eternal purpose of His is being brought to pass
The Jews foolishly sought to kill Him in order to be rid of Him , not realizing that death only released His life in multiplication
If you have a problem with any of the saints, you should not partake of the Lord's table until you thoroughly deal with it
If the table is divisive in its testimony, or if you yourself are divisive in your relationship to the saints, you must not partake
Intimate the fellowship may be between a brother and me, it does not become a friendship; no personal affection is involved
As for the matter of being built up, the real building is based upon growth, not upon physical or emotional nearness
The ultimate consummation of resurrection will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth in eternity
The Jews like Nicodemus took His words literally in a physical sense and could not figure out how this Man could give them His flesh to eat
He meant that what He would give them to eat was not the meat of His physical body; that meat, 'the flesh,' was of no avail
If you study these verses carefully, you will see that 'another Comforter' is simply the Lord Himself coming back as the Spirit of reality
After talking with them and showing them His hands and His side, 'He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit'
We cannot fathom how God forms all our parts in just nine months' time, so detailed and so well suited to their function
When you first begin exercising to deduct the feelings in your mind, your will, and your emotions, you will find you are 'adding' instead!
Is not this a picture of Christians, striving to be victorious but groping in the dark because they do not know where the switch is?
We may be near but off, even as a lamp may be quite near the plug but not receive any electric current because it is not plugged in
God would have us turn away from the considerations in our mind and exercise to touch Him, to taste Him, and to find out His will
Our vision should be as clear as when we are in a car; no matter which direction we look, the see-through glass gives us an unobscured view
With our eyes we may be able to see the words on the printed page, but without understanding we shall not grasp their meaning
If you are involved in a car accident your cleverness may tell you to drive away quickly but this is not the voice of wisdom in your spirit
There are countless Christians to whom the church remains a mystery; they do not know how to look to the Lord through their spirit
In order for us to adequately know our spirit, we must first distinguish these different parts of which we are comprised
When we are regenerated, this picture of the soul as our person and the spirit as the organ by which we contact God, changes
Our existence becomes complicated, because the natural person in our soul is not in agreement with the Person in our spirit
Once you have a husband, he may want the window open when you want it shut, or he may want you to go out with him when you want to stay home
The person in your soul is offensive and displeasing to God, but the One in your spirit is a sweet fragrance to Him
In the words of the Lord Jesus, 'If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me'
The natural life in our soul has been crucified, but the functions of the soul still remain and are still useful
In our daily experience we find that part of the time we are persons in the soul and other times our person is in the spirit
While we are attending the meeting, we may be a person in the spirit, listening to God's Word, praying, and worshipping

It is far more common to pray for the Lord to help us submit to our husband or to love our wife, that we might obey His Word
When the apostle prayed that God the Father would grant us to be strengthened, he was praying for our precise need
If we pray that we may be strengthened into our inner man, the result will be that we are full of God's expression
If we are considering how inadequate the elders are or how insubordinate the sisters are, we may be assured that we are in the mind
They consider why this or that sister does not pay any attention to them, or why the elders respect another sister more than them
It is not a matter of staying away from department stores or from places of worldly entertainment because we do not love the world any more
When we are thus strengthened, Christ will make His home in our hearts and we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God
We are strengthened into our inner man Christ makes His home in our heart and we are filled even to the extent of the full expression of God
It is when we are fully one with the Lord and saturated with Him that we are also one with all other believers

Within ten minutes you will all be expressing your concepts, even if you are only discussing the best time to meet
While we are listening to a message, we may be thinking about what the speaker is wearing, or why some brother's hair is cut a certain way
If you try to eliminate the opinions of the saints by teaching or admonishing, that very teaching is an opinion
Rather than exercising the mind or giving room to the emotions, our whole being will be filled with joy in the spirit
If we take away from the New Testament these two spirits, the divine and the human, the New Testament becomes empty
Now is the time when the Lord will recover not only the proper realization of the Holy Spirit, but also the full use of our human spirit
It is correct to say that believing in Christ is the way to take this life, but how can we live such a life out?
You have also the experience of a dog's life, barking on the earth, even though your barking may be only in a whisper!
By considering these two verses together, you can see that the life was the Father's, yet He wanted the Son to live it out
Does 5:26 mean that the Father has the life and lives, while the Son also has the life but with a separate living?
How there could be two Persons but only one living is too mysterious for us to understand; all we know is what the Bible says
Too many Christians study the black and white instructions in Ephesians 5 without ever getting the secret of such a wonderful life
He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but He Who seeks the glory of Him Who sent Him, this One is true

Many Christians are still under the natural concept that now that they are Christians they must improve their behavior
After the first meeting a brother who was a professor came to me protesting that to use the words eat Jesus was too barbarous and uncultured
You will come to the deep realization that you and Christ do not have two lives but one and that your own life must be set aside
If you have this same attitude, of laying aside your will and your glory, you will find you have the best way of coming to the Word
In the political circle or the educational world you may have rank but once you step through the door of the church be prepared to be nobody
Even though we know that the Bible is a book of life and that Christ is life, to some extent we are still short of the revelation of life
From this picture it is clear that the man created in God's own image did not have the life signified by that tree
In the holy city there is a river flowing out of the throne of God; on either side of the banks of the river is the tree of life
The last invitation in the Bible is, 'Let him who is thirsty also come; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely'
The one who takes the water of life will surely have the tree of life also, because the tree is included in the water
We would have also added some negative commands, that Adam must not be hateful, nor proud, nor kill his wife, nor smite his children

In that garden stood the tree of life, signifying the Prince, Originator, Author of life, Jesus Christ, the very God, as our life

The wives, for their part, slight the verses on submission and notice the verse that says, 'Husbands, love your wives'
For us to take Christ as our life, we must realize that Christ is mysterious, that He is God, that He is the Spirit, and that He is the Word
In the Scriptures we have the terms tree of life, bread of life, water of life, Spirit of life, and word of life
The Bible itself is not Christ nor the Spirit, but the word of the Bible is the Spirit and is Christ and is God
We can tell the inquirer that if he will read these verses over and over and open himself, he will find Christ
It may have been your former practice to seek the Lord's will, to find out what is right or wrong, and what you should or should not do
