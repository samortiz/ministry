   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I was about twenty years of age I learned about this matter of recovery by reading the Bible and studying other Christian writings, especially among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They talked about the return from the captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They pointed out that the children of Israel were carried away into captivity to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then after seventy years the Lord commanded them to return to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That return was a genuine recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When some Christians talk about the Lord's recovery, they are referring to the recovery of some doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, they say that the doctrine of justification by faith was lost, but then it was recovered through Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some also have pointed out that certain practices have been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Over three hundred years ago in northern Europe some of the saints saw the matter of baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They consider that they have recovered not only the truth concerning baptism, but also a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To baptize people by immersion into water is a kind of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Presbyterians consider that they have recovered the presbytery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Presbytery actually means the eldership, referring to the type of church government.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are not Episcopalian nor Congregational in their church government.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They administrate the church by the presbytery, the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All of these groups consider that they have recovered some truths, and eventually some practice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nearly every Protestant denomination today is a result of the recovery either of a doctrine or of a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE CENTRAL RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are recoveries, but these recoveries are not so central.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The central thing in the Bible is not baptism by immersion; it is not the presbytery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not any doctrine or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The central thing in God's revelation is that God wants to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Triune God desires to express Himself in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is invisible; yet He wants and desires to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The invisible God desires to be seen through an instrument, through humanity, the very man created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man and the entire universe were created for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God created the heavens and the earth, the lifeless things, the vegetable life and the animal life, and eventually the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that all the other things are for man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man.</S>
