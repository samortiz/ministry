It is different from <i>skandalizo,</i> the Greek word for stumble in 8:13.</p><p>In verse 32 Paul speaks of Jews, Greeks, and the church of God. In New Testament times people were of three classes: the Jews&mdash;God&rsquo;s chosen people; the Greeks&mdash;the unbelieving Gentiles; and the church&mdash;a composition of the believers in Christ. We should not be an offense, a stumbling block, to any of these three, that they might be saved (v. 33).</p><h2 class="head1">PLEASING ALL MEN IN ALL THINGS</h2><p>In verse 33 Paul declares, &ldquo;Even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own advantage, but that of the many, that they may be saved.&rdquo; What a marvelous example the apostle has set for us!</p><p>It is possible to apply incorrectly Paul&rsquo;s word about pleasing all men in all things and about seeking the advantage of the many that they may be saved. Some of those who misapply this verse say that in order to bring people to the Lord, we must come down to their level. This is to say that we must go back to the world in order to bring people to Christ. However, history has proved that this does not work. Rather, those who apply Paul&rsquo;s words in this way are more likely to be brought back to the world themselves than they are to bring others to Christ. In preaching the gospel we should not lower our standard. Instead of coming down from the mountain, we should remain on the mountain and call others to come up to where we are. We must be very careful of misusing this verse and forming it into a principle contrary to Paul&rsquo;s meaning.</p><h2 class="head1">IMITATING ONE WHO IMITATES CHRIST</h2><p>In 11:1, a verse which actually belongs to the conclusion of chapter ten, Paul says, &ldquo;Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.&rdquo; Because Paul was a follower of Christ, it was right for the Corinthian believers, and all others, to follow him. If anyone is an imitator of Christ, we should be imitators of him. This makes us also imitators of Christ. Otherwise, we should be imitators of no man. Actually, in following anyone who is an imitator of Christ, we do not follow that person, but Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">FOCUSED ON THE CENTRAL VISION</h2><p>I do not have any burden to speak on the four basic principles regulating the conduct of New Testament believers. Many years ago, I gave messages on each of these principles. Today my burden is that the Lord&rsquo;s people would be brought back to the central vision of Christ and the church. Thus, we need to apply these verses and these principles to the church. I would be unhappy to see the saints applying them as proverbs to humanity in a general way. In considering these principles and this section of 1 Corinthians, we need to be focused on the central vision of Christ and the church. We all need to pay our attention to this vision and pray more concerning it.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_151.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_153.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 Corinthians &nbsp; pg 152</div><br></body></html>
