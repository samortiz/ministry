   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. PRAYING AND SEEKING THE TRUTH WITH COMPANIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What do companions do when they get together?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If they talk about worldly things, they will be distracted from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If they insult one another with offensive words, they destroy one another.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The five companions should always call on the name of the Lord together 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They should always come together to fellowship, pray-read, pray, and take care of new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One brother's new ones should be another brother's new ones also.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this way one group of five saints will have fifteen new ones under their care.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these new ones will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The principle for the saints in both the Old and New Testaments is that they should be grouped together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The young people need to flee youthful lusts and pursue the Lord with some companions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Prayer strengthens their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Prayer will move the Lord to work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Prayer will give them the guidance on how to go on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul said in 1 Tim 2:1, "I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men.''</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Prayer is the first thing we must do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We like to talk; we do not like to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to develop a habit of praying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Daniel prayed three times a day kneeling before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That was his habit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, young people should pray together to develop such a holy habit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul also charged the saints to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The young people need to develop a spiritual habit to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The best way to develop such a habit is to pray every time we think about someone and every time we have to do something or say something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the young people will pray together, they will afford the Lord a chance to perfect them for the work of the ministry and for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They should research the things concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a group comes together, one brother may ask the others if they can speak something concerning the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The young people in the church may know how to call on the name of the Lord, and they have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, some may not know assuredly that they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, their assurance of salvation will be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The young people should thoroughly fellowship matters such as the assurance of salvation and regeneration in their groups.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There has not been enough time for the church as a whole to cover these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a result, the knowledge and experience of the young people is too general.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The young people should take care of their own needs in their groups of five.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If they do not, we may eventually have a good number of saints among us, but they will not be thoroughly rooted in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If five young people cannot speak clearly to each other about the assurance of salvation, how can they help others?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They may only be able to help them to call on the name of the Lord in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In their groups the young ones should help each other to be clear about the life experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to lay a foundation for the young people's work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The young ones should be helped to know what the assurance of salvation is, what regeneration is, and what eternal life is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If each group covers one or two points a week, after half a year they will have covered thirty or forty basic points.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This will lay a good foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not enough to come together and pray in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The young people must do something specific, just as we eat something specific and definite at every meal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To practice meeting in small groups is not a difficult thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every week after a church meeting, five young people could go to a brother's home for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To spend even only fifteen minutes will be a help to them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They should not fellowship there in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the time to cover two or three specific points.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We hope that all the young people will have a burden for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to do the building-up work, they need to be caught and occupied by God, to purpose in their heart not to be defiled, and to flee youthful lusts with their companions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The companions need to fellowship with one another, pray, seek the Lord in the Word, and preach the gospel together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord will prepare these young ones for His move, His recovery, and for the building up of His church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Questions Name three people from the Old Testament who were called by God in their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Discuss their circumstances and calling.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>List four things that a group of companions should do when they are together.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Can you quote from memory 2 Timothy 2:22?</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Why does God "wreck'' people?</S>
