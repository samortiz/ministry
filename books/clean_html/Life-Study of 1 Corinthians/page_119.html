<h2 class="head2">D. Depending upon the Gift<br />We Have Received from God</h2><p>In verse 7 Paul says, &ldquo;But I wish all men to be even as myself; but each has his own gift from God, one of this kind, another of that.&rdquo; Since the Apostle Paul is so absolute for the Lord and His economy, he wishes all men to be as he is (v. 8). He desires them not to marry but to remain as he that they also may be absolute for the Lord&rsquo;s interests without distraction (vv. 33,35). In this wish he expresses the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration concerning His called ones.</p><p>For a believer in Christ to be able not to marry is a gift from God (Matt. 19:10-12). For those who have not received such a gift, it is better to marry (1 Cor. 7:9). It all depends upon the gift we have received from God. If a person does not have the gift not to marry and yet deliberately refrains from marrying, he will face difficulties and may damage himself. Married life is troublesome. But if anyone does not have the gift, the ability, not to marry, that one should marry and accept its troubles. Otherwise, by choosing not to be married, he may have even greater difficulties.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Good to Remain Unmarried</h2><p>Verse 8 says, &ldquo;But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I.&rdquo; This was the apostle&rsquo;s wish and opinion in his earlier ministry (vv. 7, 25, 40). Later, after witnessing the actual outcome, he charged young widows to marry (1 Tim. 5:11-15).</p><p>According to Paul&rsquo;s word in this verse, it is good for a believer to remain unmarried. However, we are not able to fulfill this word without receiving the necessary gift from the Lord.</p><p>In verse 26 Paul says, &ldquo;I consider then that this is good because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man to be as he is.&rdquo; Here Paul indicates that, because of the present necessity, it is good for virgins not to marry. The Greek word for present may also mean that the presence of a certain thing foreshadows and inaugurates something to come. The present necessity or distress indicates more anguish to come, as prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 24:8, 19, and 21. The word rendered necessity means force, constraint; hence, distress, anguish. It refers to the needs of the life in the present age, the demand of which constrains and presses people and becomes a distress and anguish to them. Therefore, it is good to remain unmarried (vv. 27, 40a).</p><h2 class="head2">F. Better to Marry If Lacking Self-control</h2><p>In verse 9 Paul says, &ldquo;But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.&rdquo; According to this verse, if someone does not have self-control, it is better for that one to marry. The Greek word for self-control here also means continency. The same Greek word is used in 9:25 for athletes abstaining from sensual indulgences during preparation for the games.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Remaining in Marriage That<br />the Unbelieving Party May Be Saved</h2><p>In verses 13 and 14 Paul says, &ldquo;And a wife who has an unbelieving husband and he consents to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.&rdquo; In verse 16 Paul refers to the possibility of a wife saving her husband, or of a husband saving his wife. Here we have the principle of remaining in marriage that the unbelieving party may be saved. This means that a believer who is married to an unbeliever should not take the initiative to give up that marriage. Instead of seeking to change his status, he should remain in the married life in order to save the unbelieving party.</p> <p>In verse 14 Paul speaks of an unbelieving husband being sanctified by the wife and an unbelieving wife being sanctified by the husband. To be sanctified is to be made holy, separated unto God for His purpose. As the believing wife is of the Lord and for the Lord, so her unbelieving husband is made holy, sanctified, separated unto God, because he is for his wife, who is of and for God. It is similar to the temple and the altar making the common things holy when they are attached to them (Matt. 23:17, 19). The same principle applies to the unbelieving wife and the children. To be sanctified in this way does not mean the person is saved, just as the sanctification of food through the saints&rsquo; prayer has nothing to do with salvation (1 Tim. 4:5).</p>
