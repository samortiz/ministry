   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now in chapter twenty-seven we have a contrast between righteousness and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because of the unrighteousness of the government of the kingdom of this world, Christ was wrongly condemned to die.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, actually He was rightly sentenced to death by the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Pilate, the Roman governor, should have judged Christ according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Roman law, the Sanhedrin acted illegally in arresting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If Pilate had been just, he would have stopped the Sanhedrin from doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because he was unrighteous and afraid of the Jewish religious leaders, he acted against Roman law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a result, he released to the crowd Barabbas, the guilty one, but Jesus, he scourged and delivered up to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 27 through 32 show how the Lord Jesus was mocked by the heathen soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, fulfilling Isaiah 53:7-8.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They gave Him wine mingled with gall, a stupefying drink, but the Lord would not be stupefied.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreover, when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves, casting lots.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, the Lord was robbed to the uttermost by sinners, fulfilling Psalm 22:18.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By the time of Matthew 27:45, unrighteous men had exhausted their deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They had done everything they could.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time, God came in, in a righteous way to judge this crucified Savior and to forsake Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus suffered on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God's will; in the last three hours He was judged by God to accomplish our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was during this time that God counted Him as our Substitute who suffered for our sin Isa 53:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Darkness fell over all the land Matt 27:45 because our sin and sins and all negative things were being dealt with there, and because of our sin God forsook Him v. 46 .</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hallelujah, His death tore the veil of the temple from top to bottom, shook the base of Satan's rebellion, and broke the strongholds of Satan's kingdom!</S>
