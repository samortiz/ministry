   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE IMPARTING OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the Spirit sanctifies us from within, He imparts God's life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To impart God's life into our being means to give us life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we were saved and regenerated, we received God's life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, this does not mean that we received God's life in a total sense.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we have received God's life into us, we still need more impartation of God's life into us each day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This does not take place once for all; rather, it is a gradual process that goes on during our entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No matter how experienced we may be in the spiritual life, this process of life imparting must still go on within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the Spirit carries out His sanctifying work, He imparts more of God's life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I can testify that I have more of God's life today than I did a year ago, and much more than twenty-five years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In April, 1925, I received God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although I was very excited when I first received the divine life, I actually had only a little of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But day by day throughout the years, more of God's life has been imparted into me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every month and every year I have gained more of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This imparting of life always accompanies the sanctifying work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without His work of sanctification, He could not impart God's life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Life imparting is always included within God's sanctifying work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The extent to which the impartation of life will proceed depends on the degree He is able to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The impartation of life is always the issue of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, life imparting and sanctifying work together.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the Spirit sanctifies us, He gives us life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This also is like teafication.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the tea bag teafies the water, the tea essence goes wherever the teafication takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within the teafication is the essence of the tea.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the same with the sanctifying and life-imparting work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the sanctification of the Spirit of holiness there is the very impartation of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not arrive at this understanding through mental figuration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is absolutely according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you have not been regenerated and if you have not had this experience, you will simply be unable to understand what I am talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But according to our experience, we know that in this sanctification is the life impartation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>TRANSFORMATION, A METABOLIC CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When life is imparted into us, the result is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is similar to a chemical reaction caused by one element being added to another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The divine life brought into us through sanctification is a divine chemical element.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When this element is imparted into our being, there is a reaction, and that reaction is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Transformation means to change our nature, essence, appearance, tastes, and our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Transformation is not outward change, correction, or adjustment; it is altogether an inward, metabolic change of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the process of metabolism, a new essence is added to replace an old, to carry away the old, and to produce a new situation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This metabolism is the very transformation revealed in the New Testament Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Transformation is a divine metabolism wherein a new element is added to the old to discharge the old and to create a new situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If our eyes are opened to see this, we shall drop all the teachings derived from the past regarding correcting ourselves and improving our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such outward changes are not metabolic changes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are not the result of something new being added into our being to discharge the old and to create a new situation.</S>
