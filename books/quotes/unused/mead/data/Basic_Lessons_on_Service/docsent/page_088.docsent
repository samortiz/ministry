   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. THE FLESH BEING UNABLE TO PLEASE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 8:8 says that those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the flesh cannot subject itself to the law of God, it cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is impossible for the flesh to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All these points need much development for our sharing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>NOT TRUSTING IN THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Philippians 3:3 Paul said, "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The religious ones may worship and serve God while always boasting and having confidence in the flesh, but we should not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not have any confidence in our flesh for our worship and service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>NOT SOWING UNTO THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Galatians 6:8a says that if we sow unto the flesh, we will reap corruption of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To sow unto one's own flesh is to sow for one's own flesh, with the desire and purpose of the flesh in view, to fulfill what the flesh covets.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not carry out any kind of spiritual endeavor by our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I may go to visit a saint in my flesh and not in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That is the sowing unto the flesh that will yield a harvest of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Corruption will eventually come out of visiting the saints or the churches in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not invest in any spiritual things by our flesh or unto our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do this, we will reap corruption of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>XIII.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>NOT FULFILLING THE LUST OF THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Galatians 5:16 says, "Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Walking by the Spirit keeps us from fulfilling the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>XIV.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>CRUCIFYING THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Galatians 5:24 says, "But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The flesh is good only for crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It must stay on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church service, we must help all the saints to see that our motive and intention must be pure, without any element of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ambition is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No other work exposes our flesh as much as the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The secular work is absolutely according to the flesh, so this kind of work does not expose the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the church service is altogether a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, whatever we do by our flesh is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to have the proper church service, every saint should know not only the Spirit but also the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we know the flesh and do nothing according to the flesh, there will be no jealousy, envy, or ambition among us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I feel that this lesson on the flesh is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the saints need to know this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The flesh is a terrible "gopher."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Most of the time it is hidden, but sometimes it comes to the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A gopher is a good illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The flesh is a great undermining factor that damages the church life.</S>
