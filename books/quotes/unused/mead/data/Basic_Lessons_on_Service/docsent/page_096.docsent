   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SELF BEING INDEPENDENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The self is independent of God Matt 16:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It does not care for God's will or for God's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>V. THE SELF BEING THE EMBODIMENT OF</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE SOULISH LIFE, ONE WITH SATAN, AND EXPRESSED THROUGH THE MIND OPINIONATED THOUGHTS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this point there are three subpoints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, the self is the embodiment of the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, it is one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Third, it is expressed through the mind, which is actually the opinionated thoughts Matt 16:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen already that the fallen soul is the source of the self, so the self is just the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The self is the embodiment of the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At man's fall, Satan not only entered into man's body but also entered into man's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because Eve firstly accepted Satan's thought into her mind Gen 3:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then she ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which entered into her body v. 6 . Before the fruit entered into her body, Satan's thought had already entered into her mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the fallen soul is one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is also based upon what we see in Matthew 16, where the Lord rebuked Peter by calling him "Satan" v. 23 . At that time Peter was in the self, in his soulish life, so he became Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This proves that the self is one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After addressing Peter as "Satan," the Lord said, "You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This shows that the self, which is one with Satan, is expressed through the mind as opinionated thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, Matthew 16:23-24 shows us that the self is the embodiment of the soulish life, is one with Satan, and is expressed through the mind, that is, the opinionated thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mind is the channel, the means, for the self to express itself.</S>
