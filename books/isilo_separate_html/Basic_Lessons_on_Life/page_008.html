The Human Spirit Being Very Close<br>to God the Spirit</H2><P>The human spirit is very close to God the Spirit. Many Bible readers mistakenly think that the breath of life breathed into the nostrils of the dusty man was the life of God. They consider that at the time of creation, God imparted His life into man's earthen body. They do not see the difference between God's breathing the breath of life into man in Genesis 2:7 and the Lord Jesus' breathing the Holy Spirit into the disciples in John 20:22. When the Lord Jesus breathed the Spirit of God into the disciples, the eternal life entered into the disciples. But when God breathed the breath of life into the dusty body of man, that breath of life became man's human spirit.</P><P>Two principles do not allow us to say that God's life entered into man at his creation when God's breath of life was breathed into him. The first principle is that of man's free will. If God had put His eternal life into man at his creation, there would have been no need for man to exercise his free will. This would mean that God's creation accomplished His purpose without the exercise of man's will. This is against the divine principle of God giving man a free will.</P><P>Furthermore, according to the whole Bible it is not only against the divine principle of man's free will but also against God's economy to say that man received God's eternal life at his creation. The whole Bible shows us that after God's creation, God wanted man to choose Him, so He put man in front of the tree of life, expecting that man would freely choose to receive God into him as life. It would be against His economy for God to put His life into man at the creation of man.</P><P>After the fall of man, God closed the way to the tree of life. According to the revelation at the end of Genesis 3, God closed the way to the tree of life so that fallen man would not live forever with his sinful nature (vv. 22-24). This shows us that man did not have the eternal life of God at the time of creation. Actually, man could not receive God's eternal life until the Lord Jesus passed through death and resurrection to accomplish redemption to solve the problem of sin for man and to release the eternal life of God.</P><P>Some wrongly say that man received the life of God at his creation based upon Luke 3:38, which says that Adam was the son of God. They maintain that Adam must have had the life of God; otherwise, he could not have been a son of God. But the angels are also called the sons of God (Job 1:6; 38:7). This does not mean that the angels have God's divine life with God's divine nature. In the Bible the word son has at least two meanings. One meaning is that a son is one who was born of the Father by the Father's life with the Father's nature. The second meaning is that a son is one who was created by God. Because Adam and the angels were created by God, they are called sons of God. God was their origin. Even adopted sons can be called sons of their adopted father, but they do not have his life and nature. Adam was considered the son of God because he was created by God, even as the heathen poets considered all mankind to be the offspring of God (Acts 17:28). Mankind was only created by God, not regenerated of Him. This is absolutely and intrinsically different from the believers in Christ being the sons of God. They have been born, regenerated, of God and possess God's life and nature (John 1:12-13; 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:4).</P><P>Although man did not receive God's life at his creation, he was created with a human spirit, which came from God's breath of life. Thus, although the human spirit is not the Spirit of God or the divine life of God, it is very close to the Spirit of God. This is why the human spirit can receive God the Spirit. A substance like copper has the ability to receive electricity but wood or paper does not. Between the electricity and the copper there is no insulation but rather a kind of transmission. Likewise, between God the Spirit and our human spirit there is a kind of transmission; there is no insulation. But between our physical body and the Spirit of God or between our psychological being and the Spirit of God there is a kind of insulation; there is no transmission. Because the human spirit comes out of God's breath of life, our human spirit is very close to God the Spirit. We have to stress this because this will lay a good foundation for the following lessons on life. We cannot help people to go on in life if we miss this very crucial point.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
