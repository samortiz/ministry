[3]  This volume is composed of gospel messages given by Brother Watchman Nee.
[4]  Chapters One through Fifteen and Appendix One have been published previously as The Normal Christian Faith.
[5]  The whole series is divided into four sections, containing subjects about faith that range from the knowledge of God, Christ, and the Bible to the doctrines of redemption, life, and the Spirit.
[6]  We will look at the Christian faith from its very foundation.
[7]  The first subject we are confronted with is God.
[8]  On the one hand, they dare not say there is no God, but on the other hand, they are not clear if God does exist.
[9]  The preacher pressed on: "I am afraid that you are not really saying that you believe there is no God, you are just hoping that there is no God."
[10]  Many people are not really convinced that there is no God; they merely hope so.
[11]  When I was a student I claimed that there was no God.
[12]  Although I was extremely strong in my claim, something within me seemed to be protesting and saying, "There is a God."
[13]  If you are not God, you can never be qualified to say that there is no God."
[14]  Some will immediately step back and say, "I have never said that I know there is no God.
[15]  One can never tell whether there is a God or not."
[16]  Well, if you cannot give a conclusion, I will ask witnesses whom I consider trustworthy to present arguments to you and prove the existence of God.
[17]  Once I was preaching the gospel with a co-worker of mine in a village.
[18]  Once a missionary to South America saw a man preaching before a crowd in an open space in a forest.
[19]  The man forcefully and vehemently denied the existence of God.
[20]  With enthusiasm he gave more than ten reasons, one after another, to prove the nonexistence of God.
[21]  I shall begin by assuming that the issue of God's existence is settled.
[22]  As those who desire to know the truth, we must go one step further to find out what kind of God He is.
[23]  If God wants to reveal Himself to man and if He wants us to know Him, how does He do it?
[24]  If there is any book that has been written by God, it must meet certain conditions or have certain qualifications before one can say that it is from God.
[25]  After searching through all the books, you have to come finally to the Bible.
[26]  If God desires to communicate with man, and if He does so through writing, then this is the only book that can pass the four tests.
[27]  Hence, this must be the book God has for man.
[28]  If you read this book carefully, you have to admit that God's hand is behind all the writings.
[29]  Genesis was written about fifteen hundred years before Christ, and Revelation was written ninety-five years after Christ.
[30]  But we will employ the effective method we have adopted namely, setting down a few principles.
[31]  We want to base our evaluation on what manner of life a person should possess and what qualifications he must have if he is God.
[32]  The first condition that this person must fulfill is that he must claim to be God while he is on earth.
[33]  If he can achieve what we cannot achieve and know what we do not know, we can say that he is truly God.
[34]  Perhaps we will go back a little bit to the earlier parts in the Gospel of John and see what it says there.
[35]  John 1:18 says, "No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him."
[36]  Verse 18 says, "Because of this therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God."
[37]  In John 10:37-38 Jesus said, "If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; but if I do them, even if you do not believe Me, believe the works so that you may come to know and continue to know..."
[38]  Read carefully John 14:6-7: "Jesus said to him, I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him." It says clearly that if you know Jesus of Nazareth, you have known the invisible God.
[39]  If God is to be a man, He must come into the world in a way that is very different from all other mortals.
[40]  We come into the world through our parents and are conceived by our mothers.
[41]  To ascertain whether Jesus of Nazareth is an ordinary person or the incarnated God, we need to examine His birth.
[42]  If His birth was no different from ours, we have to conclude that He is nothing but a man.
[43]  Perhaps we should read the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.
[44]  I love the story about Jesus once walking down a road.
[45]  Many people were gathered around Him, hoping to see the resurrection of a dead person.
[46]  They said, "You see the crowd pressing upon You and You say, Who touched Me?" v. 31 . He should have asked, "Who pressed Me?" instead of "Who touched Me?" If I were Jesus, I would have said in a gentlemanly fashion, "Excuse me." But Jesus did not need to say that.
[47]  Let us examine some of the deeds of Jesus of Nazareth.
[48]  Matthew 11:2 and 3 say, "Now when John heard in the prison of the works of the Christ, he sent word through his disciples and said to Him, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?"
[49]  John wanted to make sure that Jesus was the Christ sent from God.
[50]  Verses 4 and 5 say, "And Jesus answered and said to them, Go, report to John the things that you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel announced to them."
[51]  Our Christian faith is based upon the revelation of God.
[52]  Hence, the true Christian faith is based on a person.
[53]  It is built on Christ and not on some doctrines.
[54]  The crux of the true Christian faith is a question of who Jesus is!
[55]  Prior to the coming of Christ, a forerunner was sent by God to prepare a way for Christ that men might be ready to acknowledge Christ.
[56]  But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
[57]  No wonder Nicodemus asked, "How can these things be?"
[58]  Jesus told him that this is not an earthly matter.
[59]  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.
[60]  For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.
[61]  When she asked Jesus for this living water, "Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water" v. 10 .
[62]  The only thing He did was point to Himself, as if to say, "Well, if you know who He is, you will ask of Him at once, and He will give you living water, that you may never thirst again."
[63]  "The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet" v. 19 . Because Christ told her everything that she ever did, she perceived that this was no ordinary man.
[64]  Jesus said something more to show her that He was not merely a prophet: "Believe Me" v. 21 . The woman said, "I know that Messiah is coming He who is called Christ ; when He comes, He will declare all things to us" v. 25 . What did Jesus answer her? He said, "I, who speak to you, am He" v. 26 . The first thing that a sinner needs to do is not to repent and change his behavior, but to realize who Jesus is.
[65]  Is this not the Christ?" v. 29 . I do not like the words, "Is this not." Since she knew that this man was the Christ, why did she say, "Is this not"? At any rate, she believed and went to tell others that Christ had come.
[66]  When we come to John 7, we see the last day of a great feast.
[67]  Jesus spoke some words in front of those who were attending the feast.
[68]  "On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.
[69]  Concerning this matter I have never given in. I told you that I am; I am the One." Time after time He proved to others that He is; He is the Son of God.
[70]  He asked the healed person only one question: "Do you believe into the Son of God?" v. 35 . He answered, "Who is He, Lord, that I may believe into Him?" v. 36 . "Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and He is the One speaking with you.
[71]  In John 12 Jesus cried out aloud, "He who believes into Me does not believe into Me, but into Him who sent Me; and he who beholds Me beholds Him who sent Me. I have come as a light into the world, that every one who believes into Me would not remain in darkness" vv.
[72]  Then in John 14 the Lord said, "Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me" v. 1 . He wants us to believe into Him in the same way that we believe into God.
[73]  We have said that Christianity does not emphasize doctrines.
[74]  Even when some doctrines are mentioned, they are few in number, and when you go about expounding them, they always point back to a person.
[75]  If you turn to the four Gospels you will be amazed to find that everything recorded is just a description of Jesus of Nazareth.
[76]  This is exactly what we have said before, that you have to know who Jesus Christ is before you can understand what His doctrines are all about.
[77]  If you open the Bible to see how this can be, you will see that the source of such a doctrine is the fact that God became a man Jesus.
[78]  Another fact we have is the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[79]  Hence, on our side, we are not only dead to sin, disassociated from it; we are regenerated and a new creation in the resurrection of Christ.
[80]  Romans 3:22, 24: "Even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction;...being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus."
[81]  Who will deliver me from the body of this death?
[82]  Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord!
[83]  So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin."
[84]  In the same manner, verses 38 and 39 say, "For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[85]  Not only so, God has made Christ our wisdom,...etc. We think that though we are not too brilliant, if we study more books, read more of the Bible, and listen to more sermons, we will be more intelligent.
[86]  First Corinthians 4:15: "For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."
[87]  First Corinthians 4:17: "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church."
[88]  You will discover that not only here, but in numerous passages, it is mentioned that the Christian walk should be one that is in Christ.
[89]  First Corinthians 15:12-14: "But if Christ is proclaimed that He has been raised from the dead, how is it that some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
[90]  Verses 16-17: "And knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified.
[91]  Galatians 2:20 is another precious verse: "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me."
[92]  Ephesians 1:3: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."
[93]  Verses 4-7: "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved; in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace."
[94]  We have seen that one cannot separate Christ from truth or from the doctrines.
[95]  Nor can He be isolated from the Christian faith.
[96]  What then is the relationship Christ has with us human beings?
[97]  Before we come to look at the relationship Christ has with man, we have to investigate the law of heredity a little.
[98]  Let us first read verses 1 through 10: "For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace; being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.
[99]  Now we want to examine the crucial relationship the two men have with the whole of humanity.
[100]  Romans 5:12: "Therefore just as through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin, death; and thus death passed on to all men because all have sinned."
[101]  Verse 14: "But death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of Him who was to come."
[102]  Romans 5:15 follows, by saying, "But it is not that as the offense was, so also the gracious gift is; for if by the offense of the one the many died, much more the grace of God and the free gift in grace of the one man Jesus Christ have abounded to the many."
[103]  In the same way, by the righteous act of one man, Jesus Christ, who was not only sinless but was so obedient that He died on the cross, all those in Him receive life and are constituted righteous.
[104]  Since we Christians are so utterly identified with Christ, the obedience of Christ becomes our obedience, the death of Christ becomes our death, the living of Christ becomes our living, and the glory of Christ becomes our glory.
[105]  Every religion makes some contribution to the well-being of society.
[106]  Every one of them has a point in common: giving man something or bringing man towards some goal.
[107]  I have been preaching for more than ten years.
[108]  Therefore, the salvation of man cannot start from the outside.
[109]  We still need to look at the Scripture to understand the matter of regeneration.
[110]  First Corinthians 2:14: "But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually."
[111]  Not only is he unable to understand the things of God, but he regards them as foolishness.
[112]  CHRIST AND THE NEW LIFE CHAPTER NINE FORGIVENESS OF SINS
[113]  God has no desire to change our outward behavior; He only wants to change our life.
[114]  If these things are not settled, God can never give life to us, and we will never have the right to receive anything from Him.
[115]  When we sin, our conscience also does not let us go.
[116]  Sometimes when the conscience is hushed, we do not sense too much guilt.
[117]  If we sin carelessly and God forgives our sins irresponsibly, then God Himself falls into sin in His forgiveness.
[118]  This does not mean that God does not have the power to forgive sins, but it means that God can only grant forgiveness when it comes up to His dignity.
[119]  He said, "Mr. Nee, if God wants to forgive our sins, why can He not just say so? Why did He have to send His Son to be crucified on the cross? This is too cumbersome!" He thought that God is a nice fellow who writes off our sins unscrupulously without any concern for the law! He did not realize that God had to go through many steps before He could issue forgiveness.
[120]  I believe we have to see one more aspect of the meaning of forgiveness.
[121]  For example, if someone has stolen my pencil and I have forgiven him, it means that I have suffered the loss of a pencil.
[122]  Romans 3:25-26: "Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus."
[123]  She said that she was an evil person and had committed many sins.
[124]  We will select a few more passages to see how Christ accomplished redemption for us.
[125]  Romans 5:6-8: "For while we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
[126]  But God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[127]  For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled."
[128]  Then 3:18: "For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the spirit."
[129]  The highest goal in the salvation of God is the dispensing of His life into man.
[130]  It is impossible to have a God-like living with our human life.
[131]  Romans 6:6: "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves."
[132]  One time I was at the home of one of my friends.
[133]  He had a maid who gave him much trouble.
[134]  We have seen that by including us in Christ, God accomplished redemption.
[135]  This identification with Christ is purely the work of God.
[136]  The present question is: How can Christ be worked into us?
[137]  Having Christ worked into us and having a vital life relationship between Him and us is the essence of the Christian life.
[138]  Second Corinthians 5:16 says, "So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer."
[139]  The Christ that we preach is no longer the Christ in the flesh.
[140]  If you asked me whether I would like to see Christ walking today in the flesh in the manner that the twelve disciples knew, I would tell you a strong no. This would be absolutely useless to me! If Jesus of Nazareth were here today, He would be isolated.
[141]  I write a great deal, yet my handwriting is not very good.
[142]  Verse 17 says, "Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you."
[143]  This is a most precious portion of the Bible.
[144]  When Christ was on the earth, the Holy Spirit, who is the Comforter, lived inside of Him.
[145]  When Christ was with the disciples on earth, the Holy Spirit was with the disciples already, for the Spirit was inside Christ.
[146]  This union moreover transmits to us everything that God did in Christ and everything that God is through Christ.
[147]  Read again John 16:7: "But I tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you."
[148]  Everyone who has received Christ should be able to say that our Christ is not merely the Christ in the flesh whom Peter touched; our Christ is the Christ in the Spirit.
[149]  When did Peter begin to know Christ in such a clear way?
[150]  Not during the three years that he followed the Lord back and forth.
[151]  Unless Christ is in the Holy Spirit and unless He comes into us, we can never know Him in a real way.
[152]  Now we come to the critical point of the Christian faith; it is the peak of the salvation of God.
[153]  We want to see how Christ can be our life in a subjective way.
[154]  In order that we may know and contact Him, God was incarnated to become a man.
[155]  Through this man we come to realize what God is like.
[156]  God bestows to those who are in Christ the very same life that was embodied in Jesus of Nazareth.
[157]  Now God has a just ground upon which He can dispense life to us, and we also have a proper standing to receive boldly this new life from God.
[158]  John 3:7 says, "You must be born anew."
[159]  First John 5:12 says, "He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life."
[160]  Verse 13 continues, "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God."
[161]  This is not a matter of doctrines, works, or moral behavior; rather, it is a matter of having or not having the Son of God.
[162]  John 3:16 tells us that God gave His only begotten Son to man, and 1:12 says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name."
[163]  A friend of mine told me once, "Mr. Nee, I really want to receive the Son of God into my life.
[164]  I have prayed to God and told Him that I desire to have Christ in me.
[165]  I was told that when Christ comes into me, I will have a burning sensation within.
[166]  How do I know if I really have received the Son of God into me as life?"
[167]  I said, "The Bible does not say that a man will feel burning or will remain cold when he receives the Son of God.
[168]  CHRIST AND THE CHRISTIAN CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE MEANING OF FAITH
[169]  A Christian is a person who has received Christ and His great salvation.
[170]  How does one receive Him and His accomplished work?
[171]  The world around us is composed of myriads of objects of various colors and shapes.
[172]  There is also a host of images and objects inside of us.
[173]  If we merely exercise our five senses, we have to conclude that God does not exist, that there is no Christ, and that neither forgiveness of sins nor redemption of sinners is substantial, that there is no such thing as a new life, and that all spiritual matters are mere fantasies.
[174]  Perhaps you have heard about the doctrines of Christ for more than ten years.
[175]  But all the time you have simply stored them up in your mind.
[176]  You must proclaim, "I believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.
[177]  We have mentioned the resurrection of Christ and shown how we can receive a new life in this resurrection.
[178]  But there is another crucial matter which has decisive bearing upon our Christian life.
[179]  When Christ was on the earth, a young Israelite came to Him.
[180]  This man was a very noble and refined person.
[181]  He asked, "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
[182]  On that day, the Lord did not tell him what we are used to hearing, that if he believed in Him he would have eternal life.
[183]  He continued, "All that you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me" v. 22 . How did the young man react to these words? He began to realize that what God requires he could never fulfill.
[184]  Hebrews 8:8-9 says, "For finding fault with them He says, Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah, not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.'"
[185]  Hebrews 8:10 and 11 say, "For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them."
[186]  Once I was invited to dinner at a missionary's home.
[187]  I asked him, "Can you say that you have overcome all your sins?"
[188]  But I cannot say the same because if I say it and then lose my temper, what am I going to do?
[189]  God has also put you into His resurrection that He may be your life within.
[190]  You are not believing because if you were, you would praise God for Christ being your life.
[191]  A friend asked me once, "I have believed in Jesus Christ and received forgiveness of sins through His redemption.
[192]  Now that I am saved, what should my attitude be towards my country, towards society, and towards international problems?
[193]  Should I take a passive stand and close my ears to everything, or should I actively participate in the solution to all problems?"
[194]  No doubt we see many problems existing in our society and nation.
[195]  The order in which God works out His salvation is first to save us and solve our problem of sin.
[196]  The world is like a large old ship that is built of different materials.
[197]  If a Christian does not know the order of God's work, and if he gives up the work of evangelism to engage himself in social and political reforms, the result is not merely a matter of right or wrong, it is a dead-end street.
[198]  All the problems of today are caused by man being out of order.
[199]  Some people think that as long as one is a Christian, it is good enough; there is no need to be part of a church.
[200]  Putting it another way, they want Christ but they do not want the church.
[201]  It is fine to have individual prayers and Bible studies, but it is too troublesome for them to be related to other people.
[202]  When a person has believed in Christ, not only does he have to negatively reject the world, but he has to positively be part of the church.
[203]  We have to realize that the life we received is perfect but not complete.
[204]  The life we received from Christ is a mutual life.
[205]  But the Bible gives a clear and simple word concerning the matter of the church.
[206]  If you read the Acts of the Apostles or the beginning of all the Epistles or the first chapter of Revelation, you can see what the Bible calls the churches.
[207]  APPENDIX TWO THERE IS A GOD Scripture Reading: Psa 14:1; Heb 11:6; Rom 3:19-20
[208]  This afternoon we will speak on a difficult subject.
[209]  I must admit that this is the second time in my life that I have spoken of this subject.
[210]  It is what Hebrews 11:6 says: "He who comes forward to God must believe that He is."
[211]  The Bible does not debate this subject; it assumes that man believes there is a God.
[212]  If a person says, "I do not believe in God; there is no such thing as God in my mind," you can hold his hand and ask him, "Friend, are you moral?"
[213]  These people do not argue from reason; they merely assert with their mouth that there is no God.
[214]  They are very stubborn, and there is no way to argue with them.
[215]  If you ask why they do not believe in God, they cannot give you any reason.
[216]  You can give them a hundred reasons why there is a God, and they will come back a hundred and one times to tell you that there is no God.
[217]  The Bible has not addressed the question of the existence of God; it only mentions Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, etc. This means that the question of the existence of God is not essential, because everyone already knows the answer.
[218]  If an atheistic friend whom we encounter often in our preaching of the gospel comes today and talks about the existence of God, he will surely say that there is no God.
[219]  I do not know if anyone can be so bold as to say that there is no God in the universe.
[220]  But let us set this question aside for now.
[221]  We have seen the greatness and smallness of the universe, the order of the universe, and man's psychology, and pointed out that they all prove the existence of God in the universe.
[222]  We will now consider another aspect, which is the Christian experience of God.
[223]  We can prove the existence of God from the experience of Christians.
[224]  We know God from His answers to prayers, from the grace of forgiveness, and from God's special protection.
[225]  We cannot go away from this subject in a light way.
[226]  We have to ask, "If there is a God, what should we do?"
[227]  It is not enough to believe that there is a God.
[228]  If you know that there is a God, you cannot live foolishly or sit idly.
[229]  This is the only way to meet God because He bestows grace to us through Christ.
