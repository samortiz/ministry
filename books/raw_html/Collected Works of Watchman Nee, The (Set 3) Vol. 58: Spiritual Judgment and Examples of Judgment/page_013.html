<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 21, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER L. C.</h2><p>I was saved at a time that I least expected. After I was saved, I loved to read the Bible and pray. My desire was to be a model pastor. Later I entered a Bible school. After three years, I graduated and was assigned a preacher's job. Upon reading Brother Nee's magazine The Christian, I came to know about the meaning of the church. Yet human affection restrained me from leaving my denomination. Later I heard Brother Nee preach at Hardoon Road, Shanghai, about the grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying to bear much fruit in John 12:24. That message opened my eyes to see how the church is produced. Brother Chang Kwang-rong once preached in P'ing Yang, Chekiang province, on the standard of a servant of God. I felt that I was unworthy to be called a servant. I prayed that the Lord would touch Brother Nee to call for a national co-workers' conference once again. The Lord heard my prayer, and I was able to attend the last special conference in Shanghai. My past has been fraught with sufferings. I have encountered pirates three times, bandits once, civil wars twice, and sickness many times. But thank the Lord, He has brought me through safely. I feel that I am too old and that the young people should take up much of the work. Yet the responsibility of the church is still on my shoulders. I do not want to hold on, yet I have to bear it. This is my problem.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Spiritual Contradictions</h2><p>Our brother is the main worker bearing responsibility around Wenchow, Chekiang. He must not retire. For years the war in our country prevented the co-workers from having regular fellowship with each another. It is a good sign that your natural interest for the Lord's work has diminished. It is good to be delivered from the self. But at the same time, you should be more aggressive by the power of resurrection. In the Lord's work, contradictions exist. Brother Hwang should encourage this contradiction. This contradiction will show you how much you are for the Lord. By living under such contradictions, one realizes how he can serve the Lord with more purity. On the one hand, we are no longer driven by natural interest in the work; we can give ourselves to the work, and we also can retire from the work. This is the experience of death. But it is not right to only have death without resurrection. On the positive side, we must be strengthened by the resurrection life so that we can labor even more than when we were young. It concerns me that some people pay much attention to the work but do not produce much fruit. For us to continue working is a matter of responsibility. It is a matter not of preference but of responsibility. Paul said that woe was to him if he did not preach the gospel and that he would receive a reward if he preached willingly. But even if he was not willing, the responsibility was still upon him. It is good to experience more of such contradictions.</p><p>If a man pays too much attention to his work, it becomes hard for him to let go. However, it is easy for him to become passive when he lets go. God often leads men through the valley of death. Brothers Yu-ting, Chin-fa, and Tien-zhu have all died. This puts the churches in P'ing Yang in great trials. I have to ask my brother, "After you are no longer attached to your work, are you clearer about how much of your service is truly for God?" When a man loses interest in the work, he finds out whether or not he is for the Lord. When a man is young, he likes to do this and that. But it is merely a demonstration of the power of the flesh and the natural man. When things are different, that is, when we are in the midst of dark days, we truly find out how much of our work is for the Lord. I am afraid that the things related to our youthful zeal had very little to do with the Lord. Most of them were for ourselves or for others. Only as the self recedes does the Lord begin to work in an inward way. The Lord can purify us so that the more we serve Him, the simpler we become.</p>
