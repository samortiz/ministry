<h1 class="title">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SALVATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26; Zech. 12:1; Job 32:8; Prov. 20:27; John 4:24; 1 Thes. 5:23; Heb. 4:12; John 3:6; 2 Tim. 4:22</h1>
<p>Everything in heaven and on earth is mysterious. The human body is a mystery, and everything related to man&rsquo;s inner being is even more of a mystery. However, the most mysterious thing about man is the human spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN HAVING A SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Some people speak of man&rsquo;s personality as being the deepest part of his being, but according to the Bible, the deepest part of man is the human spirit (Zech. 12:1; Job 32:8). Among all the creatures created by God, only man has a spirit. No other living creature has a spirit. Man is different from other creatures because he has a spirit.</p>
<p>The Bible says that God created man with a human spirit. God&rsquo;s creation of man was different from His creation of animals and plants because God made man in His own image. God&rsquo;s image is a mystery. He is invisible to man. Nevertheless, Genesis 1 says that God made man in His own image (vv. 26-27). Subsequent books of the Bible reveal that God&rsquo;s image is not a matter of a visible or tangible form but a matter of what He is, His nature.</p>
<p>We can enumerate many items of what God is, such as love, light, holiness, and righteousness. European and American laws are based mainly on the Ten Commandments that God gave in Exodus 20. The Ten Commandments reveal that God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The laws that a person makes are an expression of his person. The Ten Commandments were enacted by God, so they show that God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. This is God&rsquo;s image. God&rsquo;s image is what He is. God created man according to what He is. God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness, so He created man with these virtues. To God these virtues are His reality, His attributes, whereas to us they are His image.</p>
<p>A glove is made according to the shape of a hand so that the glove can contain the hand. A glove has the form and image of a hand, but it is not the reality of the hand. For example, kindness and truthfulness are human virtues, but these virtues are limited in man because they are merely the image of God in man, not the reality of God. God&rsquo;s intention is to enter into man to be the reality of these virtues. Followers of Confucius talk about developing and magnifying the bright virtue, but the Bible says that God is the Creator, the source, of every virtue and that He is the reality of every virtue. Hence, man must receive God as his content, reality, and life so that God can express His attributes in and through man&rsquo;s virtues. Our human virtues can be compared to a glove; God&rsquo;s attributes can be compared to a hand. Our human virtues should contain and express God&rsquo;s attributes.</p>
<p>In every stage of human life, people testify that they feel empty and vain; they have a sense of emptiness. No matter how much they attain or what they accomplish, they still feel empty and vain and desire to be filled. They are like an empty glove that is not serving its purpose, because it does not contain a hand.</p>
<p>A few cases can prove that man has a spirit. For example, the body lusts after many things, and a person&rsquo;s lustful inclinations result in numerous falls. When a person acts according to his lustful inclinations, his will disapproves and tries to restrict him. Chinese metaphysicists call this &ldquo;the battle between reason and lust.&rdquo; Paul expounds on this in Romans 7, and his exposition is much clearer than the teachings of these metaphysicists. Paul says that he willed to do good, but when he tried to do good, he realized that there was a law of sin in his members (v. 23). The will to do good is what the Chinese metaphysicists refer to as &ldquo;reason.&rdquo; Their use of the word <em>reason</em> refers to the natural law in us that wills to do good. God created man with a natural law related to the will to do good. From the time a person is born, he has a desire to do good. This is an inward law. The lust within man, however, wars with this law. Those with a strong will might overcome their lusts for a time, but those with a weak will quickly fail. When man fails, something deep within him, which the Bible calls the human spirit, often condemns and convicts him.</p>
<p>When the ancient Chinese referred to the human spirit as the bright virtue and as the innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good, they were referring to the conscience. Man may follow his lusts, and his will may be weak and fail, but something in his deepest part will condemn and convict him. Even a man who follows his evil lusts has something deep within him that can never be conquered. Man&rsquo;s deepest part is the spirit (1 Thes. 5:23; Heb. 4:12).</p>
<p>The human spirit is related to the expression of God&rsquo;s image. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; When God created man, He formed a spirit within man (Zech. 12:1). All God&rsquo;s attributes are in a believer&rsquo;s regenerated human spirit because God is the content of his regenerated human spirit. The more a person follows his lusts, the more vulgar he becomes; he may even become like an animal. Conversely, the more a person follows his conscience, the nobler he becomes. A person who follows his conscience, his knowledge of good, belongs to the highest class of humanity. This proves that there is a spirit within man. In addition to emotions, lusts, and a will, there is also a spirit within man.</p>
<p>Furthermore, man has material and psychological needs. A person who has food and clothing in abundance may still sense a need for psychological comfort and satisfaction. If a person&rsquo;s psychological needs are met, he may discover yet another need, another sense of dissatisfaction, in his deepest part. This need goes beyond the material and the psychological, and it cannot be satisfied by food, clothing, psychological comfort, or entertainment. This need comes from man&rsquo;s deepest part, the spirit. Nothing but God can satisfy this part. Food, such as beef, chicken, and bread, cannot quench a man&rsquo;s thirst; only water can quench his thirst. When a person drinks water, he is refreshed inwardly, and his thirst is quenched. The need in man&rsquo;s deepest part cannot be met by material things, nor can it be satisfied by psychological comfort or entertainment. Only God can meet this need. I believe that every human being has a sense of his need for God in his deepest part. For over six thousand years of human history men all over the world have worshipped God, but no dog or monkey has ever built a temple for worship. Human history shows that regardless of race, age, or social status, man wants to worship God.</p>
<p>In 1953 I was in the Philippines, and I read an article in the newspaper about a leader in the Soviet Union, Beria, who failed in a power struggle and was sentenced to death. Before his execution he was asked what he wanted. Surprisingly, Beria asked for a Bible and picked it up to pray. Before his execution this top leader, who had killed countless people in an atheistic country, knew that he needed God. There is a Chinese saying, &ldquo;A dying man&rsquo;s words are good words&rdquo;; this refers to the conscience at work. Within man there is a need, but he does not sense this need when he is busy. However, when man is successful, receives recognition, or is about to die, this need surfaces, and man realizes his need.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
