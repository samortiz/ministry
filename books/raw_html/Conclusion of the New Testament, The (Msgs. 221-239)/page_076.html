<h2 class=head3>3. Given an Open Door Which No One Can Shut</h2><p>In 3:8a the Lord says, “I know your works; behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut.” As the One who has the key of David and who opens and no one shall shut (v. 7), the Lord has given the recovered church “an open door which no one can shut.” Since the recovery of the proper church life began, in the early part of the nineteenth century, until now, a door has always been wide open to the Lord’s recovery. The more that organized Christianity tries to shut the door, the wider it is open. In spite of much opposition, the door today is open worldwide. The key is in the hand of the Head of the church; it is not in the hand of the opposers.<h2 class=head3>4. Subduing the Judaizers and Their Judaic Teachings</h2><p>The church in Philadelphia subdues the Judaizers and their Judaic teachings. Whereas the Catholic Church has brought in many Judaic things, adopting many of the Old Testament practices, the brothers in the recovered church in the early nineteenth century abandoned all Judaic teachings.<p>Concerning the subduing of the Judaizers and their teachings, the Lord says in 3:9, “Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, those who call themselves Jews and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause them to come and worship before your feet, and they shall know that I have loved you.” The Jewish synagogue holds on to Judaism, which comprises the mediatorial priests, the ordinances of letters, the material temple, and the earthly promises. The recovered church has subdued Judaism by exposing its error and stubbornness in holding on to the above four things and has made the Jews know that the Lord has loved her.<h2 class=head3>5. Promised to Be Kept Out of the Hour of Trial Which Is about to Come on the Whole Inhabited Earth</h2><p>“Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth” (3:10). This promise actually refers to the rapture of the overcomers before the great tribulation. “Trial” in 3:10 undoubtedly denotes the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21) “which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth,” as indicated by the fifth, sixth, and seventh trumpets with the seven bowls (Rev. 8:13—9:21; 11:14-15; 15:1; 16:1-2). The “trial” may also include the supernatural calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets. The Lord promises the recovered church that He will keep her “out of the hour of trial” (not only out of the trial but out of the hour of trial) because she has kept the word of His endurance. This promise of the Lord, like that in Luke 21:36, indicates that the saints who have kept the word of the Lord’s endurance will be raptured before the great trial.<h2 class=head3>6. The Lord’s Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</h2><p>In Revelation 3:11 and 12 we have the Lord’s promise to the overcomers in Philadelphia. To overcome in this epistle means to hold fast what we have in the recovered church.<h2 class=head4>a. To Receive a Crown</h2><p>In verse 11 the Lord says, “I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown.” The recovered church has gained the crown already. However, if she does not hold fast what she has in the Lord’s recovery until the Lord comes back, her crown may be taken away by someone. Being a reward from the Lord, this crown needs to be kept until He comes back.
