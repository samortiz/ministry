We thank the brothers and sisters in every place for their encouragement of the Lord's love, their constant care, and their supplication so that those of us in Hankow, His very weak children, can hide under the shadow of His wings and be preserved. Glory to His name! Enclosed please find a little sum of X dollars for use in the work in the inland provinces or in the frontier work. This little sum expresses the sympathy of the members in Hankow towards the labor of the Lord's faithful servants in the barren lands. This little gift also shows that our heart and prayer follow these workers. May the footsteps of the Lord's servants be excellent everywhere they go, amen!</p><p>Weak members in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi and Hu Lan-seng on behalf of the saints<br />in Hankow, February 24</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>There is now no more need in Hankow. Occasionally, one or two local brothers and sisters have needs, and the local church here can take care of them. Last Lord's Day we received X dollars from the local offering box, which was designated for the publication need of The Open Door. We will forward the money to you when the accounts are cleared. The Lord willing, I intend to come to Shanghai and learn something from the brothers and sisters. Please pray for this. May the Lord grant me the grace to learn the lessons that He has given me under the present circumstance.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi, March 30</p><h2 class="head2">Yuan-Ning, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear beloved of the Lord:</p><p>We are unworthy sinners in the eyes of God, yet He has chosen to save us through His wonderful grace and mercy so that we can become fellow citizens with His saints and be His people. We cannot help but praise the Lord who has loved us forever and ever, amen! Since the fire in Ch'ang-sha, the population here has increased tremendously. We used to have meetings on the Lord's Day afternoon for testimonies or for the preaching of the gospel. Because the number of brothers and sisters increased (to about twenty), we began to have a bread-breaking meeting. The Lord has been blessing us. The population is dense, and there is a great need for the gospel. We ask that the Lord send His own workers to reap this harvest! When we have time, we borrow the Methodist Chapel to preach the gospel in the evenings. Please pray much for the members here. We are as weak as water! Enclosed please find X dollars for The Open Door. The Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Weak members in the Lord,<br />Loh Yung-dien, Chou You-seng</p><h2 class="head2">Hsu-Fu, Szechuan Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord that we moved into our own rented place last Lord's Day. The address is Yu-Ying Elementary School on Well Street. This is God's provision for us. It is a private school, and the owner has agreed to let us use the main classroom of the school in the future. Chairs, tables, and boards are all there. We pray in one accord every evening that God would send workers here to pioneer the work. The door of the work is open. The China Inland Mission has been good to us. The Baptist Church has organized a women's Sunday school and has asked me to conduct the school.</p><p>If two brothers can come together, they can take the Hsu-Fu-K'un-ming Highway, which passes from K'un-ming through the Szechuan-Yunnan Highway. That route has never been touched by the gospel before....There are twenty-two small stations between K'un-ming and Hsu-Fu. It takes twenty days to get through with sedan chairs and costs about forty-four dollars. But this is cheaper than coming by bus through Kuei-yang and Chungking. This way was once full of bandits, but the Transport Department has set up stations now. There are now many daily activities in the loading and unloading of goods; therefore, the route has become much safer. Of course, it is very exhausting to take a sedan chair for twenty days. One needs God's grace for guidance and protection. If any brother comes, please inform us ahead of time so that we can tell the colleagues working in the stations along the way to care for him and to provide him with lodging. Please convey this message to brothers who are praying for this. We hope that the Lord's church can be built up soon here in Hsu-Fu.</p><p>Brother and sister in the Lord,<br />Yuen How-tsai, Yuen Jie-min, March 17</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_095.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_097.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 96</div><br></body></html>
