<p>The third woe, the seventh trumpet, will be composed of the seven bowls (Rev. 11:14-15a; 15:1, 5-8; 16:1).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Evil and Malignant Sore of the First Bowl</h2>
<p>The evil and malignant sore of the first bowl will be upon the men who have the mark of the beast and worship his image (Rev. 16:2).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. In the Second Bowl the Sea<br />
Becoming Blood like That of a Dead Man</h2>
<p>In the second bowl the sea will become blood like that of a dead man, and every living soul that is in the sea will die (Rev. 16:3).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. In the Third Bowl<br />
the Rivers and Springs Becoming Blood</h2>
<p>In the third bowl the rivers and springs will become blood to be the drink of those who pour out the blood of the saints and the prophets (Rev. 16:4-7).</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. In the Fourth Bowl the Sun Burning Men with Fire</h2>
<p>In the fourth bowl the sun will burn men with fire (Rev. 16:8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. In the Fifth Bowl<br />
the Kingdom of Antichrist Becoming Darkened</h2>
<p>In the fifth bowl the kingdom of Antichrist will become darkened, and people will gnaw their tongues for pain and will blaspheme the God of heaven for their pains and sores (Rev. 16:10-11).</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. In the Sixth Bowl There Being<br />
the War of Armageddon</h2>
<p>In the sixth bowl there will be the war of Armageddon, in which Antichrist and his armies will fight against Christ with His overcomers. Christ will destroy Antichrist and all his evil armies, and Antichrist and the false prophet will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 16:12-16; 17:14; 19:19-21). In Revelation 14:17-20 Christ&rsquo;s defeating Antichrist and all his evil armies is likened to His treading of the great winepress of the fury of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. The Unprecedented Earthquake of the Seventh Bowl</h2>
<p>In the seventh bowl there will be an unprecedented earthquake. The great city of Jerusalem will be divided into three parts, the cities of the nations will fall, and political Babylon will be destroyed under God&rsquo;s wrath. Every island will flee, and the mountains will disappear. Furthermore, great hail will come out of heaven upon men (Rev. 16:17-21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. All the Calamities, Plagues, and Woes<br />
from the Sixth Seal to the Seventh Bowl<br />
Constituting the Great Tribulation,<br />
the Hour of Trial</h2>
<p>All the calamities, plagues, and woes from the sixth seal to the seventh bowl constitute the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), the hour of trial to try all the people who dwell on the earth (Rev. 3:10). The great tribulation will last for three and a half years (Rev. 11:2; 12:14; 13:5; 12:6).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Religious Babylon the Great Being Destroyed</h2>
<p>Probably at the beginning of the great tribulation, the religious Babylon the Great, the Roman Catholic Church, will be destroyed by Antichrist (Rev. 14:8; 17:16). At the end of the great tribulation, the political Babylon the Great, the revived Roman Empire, will be destroyed by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Two Witnesses</h2>
<p>In the great tribulation the two witnesses will spit fire out of their mouth to devour their enemies, will shut up the heavens from raining, will have authority to turn the waters into blood, and will smite the earth with every plague (Rev. 11:3-6).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Antichrist Blaspheming God<br />
and Making War with the Saints and Overcoming Them</h2>
<p>In the three and a half years of the great tribulation, Antichrist, instigated by Satan and strengthened by the false prophet, will blaspheme God and make war with the saints and overcome them. Satanic authority will be given to him over every tribe and nation (Rev. 13:4-7; 12:13-17; 2 Thes. 2:3b-4; Dan. 11:36-39; Matt. 24:15).</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Satan Being Bound for a Thousand Years<br />
and Cast into the Abyss</h2>
<p>Satan will be bound for a thousand years and cast into the abyss (Rev. 20:1-3). This will take place after Christ deals with Antichrist and his armies.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Christ Ruling the Nations<br />
with an Iron Rod for One Thousand Years</h2>
<p>Christ will rule the nations with an iron rod for one thousand years and will break them in pieces as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces (Rev. 2:27).</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. The Burning of the Rebellious People<br />
and the Casting of the Devil into the Lake of Fire</h2>
<p>At the end of the millennium, the nations, deceived by the devil, will rebel against Christ, but fire will come down out of heaven and devour them. Then the devil will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10).</p>
<h2 class="head3">10. The Judgment of the Great White Throne</h2>
<p>At the end of the day of the Lord, there will be the judgment of the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15) by Christ over the dead men, the demons, and probably the fallen angels (2 Pet. 2:4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Heavens and the Earth Being Renewed</h2>
<p>Finally, the heavens and the earth will be renewed with intense burning heat to be the new heavens and the new earth for the New Jerusalem (2 Pet. 3:10-13; Rev. 21:1-2). The day of the Lord ends with this burning heat. The heavens and the earth, the old creation, have been polluted and contaminated by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and by man&rsquo;s fall and therefore need to be renewed.</p>
<p>The day of the Lord with all of its judgments is for the manifestation of Christ. As we study the Bible, we need to realize that revelation in the Bible is centered on Christ, who is the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy. All the judgments of the day of the Lord, including all the calamities, plagues, and woes, have a goal, and this goal is to bring in the manifestation of Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
