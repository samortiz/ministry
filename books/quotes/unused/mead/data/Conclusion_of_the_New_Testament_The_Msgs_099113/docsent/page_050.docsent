   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TEN THE BELIEVERS THEIR SYMBOLS 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover five more symbols of the believers used in the New Testament: vessels of mercy unto honor and glory, branches of the cultivated olive tree, a spectacle, the offscouring of the world and the scum of all things, and the temple of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>O. VESSELS OF MERCY UNTO HONOR AND GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believers in Christ are vessels of mercy unto honor and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 9:21 says, "Has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 23 goes on to speak of God's making known "the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As vessels, we are not instruments or weapons we are containers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Romans 9, we contain mercy, honor, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This mercy, honor, and glory are actually the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the initial stage of our experience the Triune God is our mercy, in the progressing stage He is our honor, and in the completing stage He is our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At present we are enjoying our God as mercy and somewhat as honor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, we shall be fully brought into honor and also into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we shall be filled with the Triune God not only as our mercy but also as our honor and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Mercy is the most far reaching of God's attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Mercy goes further than grace, for mercy reaches into a situation that is pitiful and unworthy of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to our natural condition, we were far removed from God, totally unworthy of His grace and eligible to receive only His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How wonderful that God's mercy does not depend on our being in a good condition!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, God's mercy is shown in man's pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is God's mercy that has reached us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We were so poor and pitiful that there was the need for God's mercy to extend to our fallen condition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to see the preciousness of God's mercy and praise Him for it and testify concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once we were sinners far from God; now we are one with the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are vessels containing the Triune God as mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the words of a hymn written by Charles Wesley,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>'Tis mercy all, immense and free; For, O my God, it found out me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hymns, 296</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Paul wrote chapter nine of Romans, his thought was fully occupied with God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He says, "It is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy" v. 16 . It is altogether a matter of God's mercy that we are believers and that we are in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because all is of God's mercy, we have nothing to boast of in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our going on with the Lord is a matter not of our willing or running but of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our willing is of no avail, and our running is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's mercy, however, works in a wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are changeable, constantly fluctuating.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we should not trust in ourselves but in God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We praise the Lord that we are vessels of mercy unto honor and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We now contain Him as mercy, and we shall contain Him as honor and glory.</S>
