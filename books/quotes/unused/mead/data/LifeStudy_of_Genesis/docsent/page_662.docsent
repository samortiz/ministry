   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN BEING MATURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REIGNING ASPECT OF THE MATURED ISRAEL 5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The story of Joseph's being recognized by his brothers is the longest story in the book of Genesis, occupying three and a half chapters, from the beginning of chapter forty-two to the middle of chapter forty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was young, I thought that Joseph was too hard on his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I thought that it was all right for Joseph to be hard on them the first time they came to Egypt to buy grain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a man of God, he had the patience to discipline them, and for at least six months they underwent a trial.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, when they came to Egypt the second time, I thought that Joseph should not have done anything further to discipline them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to my opinion, Joseph should have immediately revealed himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, Joseph did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For a long time I wondered about the reason for this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Certainly the first test of Joseph's brothers was necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all agree with Joseph in testing them the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, perhaps you also have wondered why Joseph tested his brothers again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, he spread a feast for them and ate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But on the other hand, he gave them more trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What was Joseph's purpose in doing so?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe Joseph expected his brothers to notice certain hints or indications and thus to recognize him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There should have been no need for Joseph to reveal himself to them directly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to understand chapter forty-three, we need to remember that Joseph is both a type of Christ and also the reigning aspect of the mature life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Joseph was a type of Christ, we should not criticize anything he did.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are far below Joseph's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whatever he did was the best, whether we agree with it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Christ typified by Joseph could not do anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We would not do the same thing Joseph did because we are not as mature as Joseph was.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not represent the reigning aspect of the matured life; we represent disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the reason we do not agree with Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if we came up to Joseph's standard, we would admit that what Joseph did to his brothers was the best.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In his dealing with them there was no trace of childishness or foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the contrary, his dealings were wise and full of discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He dealt with his brothers so that they might be disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nothing he did to them was for his own benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>i The Children of Israel Further Forced to Turn to Christ</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just as Joseph's brothers were forced to turn to him again, so the children of Israel will be forced to turn to Christ 43:1-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the Bible, the house of Israel will return to Christ at the end of this age and recognize Jesus of Nazareth as their Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, before they do this, they will need to be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The book of Zechariah reveals that the remnant of Israel will be put on trial.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even a good number of the Israelites will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the time the house of Israel turns to Christ, not very many Israelites will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They will be tested because they refuse to return to the One they need.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Consider the nation of Israel today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How they are struggling to protect themselves!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since 1918 I have been watching the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before the reformation of the nation of Israel, the Jews were scattered, and people paid little attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Especially since 1967 the Middle East has been the focus of world news, the most crucial place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Israel is opposed by nearly the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Both the Arab countries and the United Nations condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At times even the United States disagrees with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, she must fight for her existence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Israel is condemned by other countries because she has possession of the Golan Heights and the land west of the Jordan River.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Israel insists on keeping these territories because she needs them to maintain her existence.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, if the nation of Israel would turn to Christ, everything would be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But Israel will not turn to Christ until she is forced to do so.</S>
