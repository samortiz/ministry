Even though the military has been put on full combat alert, my work cannot be concluded yet. Although the situation is tense, I am still peaceful within. The work is very busy, if not busier. Presently, I am trusting in the Lord and doing my best to complete all the business that I have to complete. I am also praying to reject everything that is not assigned by the Lord.</p><p>On October 18 he wrote, "I dare not take risks and tempt God. Yet I cannot have the same mind as the worldly people.
