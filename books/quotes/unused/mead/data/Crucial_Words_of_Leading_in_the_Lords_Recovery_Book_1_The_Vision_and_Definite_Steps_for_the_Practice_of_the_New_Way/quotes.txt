[1]  Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord s Recovery, Book 1:
[2]  The Vision and Definite Steps for the Practice of the New Way CONTENTS
[3]  We do not want any sin, any evil, or anything that is contrary to You to veil our inner being; we do not want to lose Your light, miss our fellowship with You, or forego our enjoyment of Your presence.
[4]  It is hard for you to kick against the goads v. 14 . Paul asked, Who are You, Lord? The Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute v. 15 . Then the Lord told him that He had chosen him to be a minister and a witness both of the things in which he had seen Him and of the things in which He would appear to him.
[5]  After testifying of these things, Paul concluded by saying, Therefore...I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision v. 19 . When Paul was serving God in the Jewish religion, he was serving by tradition, not by vision, but from the day the Lord met him, called him, and chose him on the way to Damascus, he became a man with a vision.
[6]  THROUGH AN OUTLINE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT From Adam to Samuel
[7]  The Old Testament begins with God s creation, or the creation of Adam, and spans four thousand years until the birth of the Lord Jesus.
[8]  If we add up these numbers, we can see one thing: Paul s word in Acts 13 does not take Saul s years into account because at the time he was king, there was a rival, which was David.
[9]  SERVING GOD ACCORDING TO THE VISION OF THE AGE
[10]  We must be clear that in every age there is the vision of that age.
[11]  When we read the record of the Bible, it appears as if Noah s family, including himself, his wife, his three children, and their wives were the only ones who were serving God.
[12]  Can we believe that at that time there were actually only eight people serving God, and the rest were worshipping idols and not serving God?
[13]  Today many Christians criticize us, saying, You are too proud.
[14]  How can you negate all the denominations and all the Christians and say that only you have the vision?
[15]  However, if we are clear concerning the vision in the Bible, we will have the confidence to say that we are in fact those who serve by following a vision.
[16]  One Pharisee, Gamaliel, a teacher of the law honored by all the people, stood up and said, Withdraw from these men and leave them alone; for should this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest you be found to be even fighters against God vv.
[17]  of Those Who Have the Vision The Example of Aquila and Priscilla
[18]  At the beginning of Acts 18, we are told that through his tentmaking Paul gained a couple, Aquila and Priscilla.
[19]  We see clearly from the revelation of the New Testament that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was acting under the vision.
[20]  Gamaliel was very knowledgeable; he was very familiar with God s principles, but he was not under the vision.
[21]  At the time of Abel, not a single book of the Bible had been written.
[22]  It was fourteen hundred years after Abel, at the time of Moses, that the Pentateuch was completed.
[23]  However, even at the time of Moses, God s revelation was still in the process of development; it was not yet complete.
[24]  When we come to the New Testament, we find Paul saying that he became a minister to the church according to the stewardship that God had entrusted to him for the completion of the word of God Col 1:25 .
[25]  Today we are not in the age of Martin Luther.
[26]  I fully agreed with the Lord s recovery, but during the first seven and a half years I was not in the Lord s recovery but in the Brethren assembly.
[27]  During the past sixty years, according to my observation and based on my knowledge of the Bible, my experience as a Christian, and my study of Christianity s history and its present condition, I can say with full confidence that the Lord s recovery is serving under the vision.
[28]  During these fifty-four years that I have been in the Lord s recovery, I have seen many people both in the northern and southern parts of China who had high moral standards and a noble character, who had learned deep lessons in life, and whose spiritual condition was good.
[29]  In the first chapter, entitled Vision in God s Economy, we read how God s servants and the Lord s followers must see a vision.
[30]  In this chapter we will continue with this burden by speaking about the vision of those who serve the Lord.
[31]  According to the revelation of the entire Bible, the Lord began showing men a vision from the time of Adam.
[32]  When Adam was first created, God showed him a clear yet relatively simple vision before he fell; he was placed in front of two trees in the garden of Eden and was told, Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die Gen 2:16-17 .
[33]  The time of Enosh was the third generation of mankind.
[34]  The fallen man discovered that he was a frail being, that he was nothing, could do nothing, and had nothing.
[35]  He realized that not only must the fallen man seek covering in God s righteousness through the shedding of the sacrificial blood, and not only must he trust in the coming One for the destruction of the enemy according to His revealed way, but this same fallen man must call on the name of Jehovah out of his vanity, nothingness, destitution, and impotence and live by the enjoyment of God s riches and supply.
[36]  He inherited Adam s vision, Abel s vision, and Enosh s vision, but he went on to see that he could not be separated from God.
[37]  THE VISIONS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT The Vision of John the Baptist
[38]  At the time the Old Testament era ended, the earthly system of service was still in place.
[39]  In Jerusalem of Judea there was still the temple, and there were still priests offering sacrifices, worshipping, and serving God according to the God-ordained institutions.
[40]  The One whom the disciples followed eventually brought them to the cross.
[41]  They were crucified with Him, died with Him, were buried with Him, and resurrected and ascended with Him Eph 2:6 .
[42]  If we study Acts 10, Galatians 2, and Acts 15, we will find that, in those cases, Peter was no longer as absolute and strong in following the vision as he was in following the Lord during the first three and a half years.
[43]  Here we have to ask, while Paul was fulfilling his ministry, who on earth was clear about God s vision?
[44]  At that time there were still many God-fearing people in the Jewish religion.
[45]  For example, Gamaliel feared God; he understood the Old Testament and was familiar with the teachings of the Old Testament, yet he was not in Paul s vision.
[46]  From the time the apostle John completed the book of Revelation until today, nineteen centuries have passed.
[47]  During the past nineteen hundred years, countless numbers of Christians have been serving God.
[48]  In order to serve God according to the up-to-date vision, we need to come up to the level of Paul s very last Epistles.
[49]  Simply put, in order for us to serve God today, our vision must extend all the way from the first vision of Adam in Genesis to the ultimate vision of the manifestation of the church, the New Jerusalem.
[50]  It is not that they do not love the Lord or serve God; it is that they love the Lord and serve God only according to the vision which they themselves have seen.
[51]  Today as we stand here and ponder the revelations unveiled in the Lord s recovery, as we read the publications that are released among us, we can see that they cover everything from the church to God s economy to the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.
[52]  Paul writes in 1 Timothy 1:3, I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things.
[53]  This verse shows that Paul was inwardly clear that there were some in Ephesus who were teaching differently.
[54]  For this reason, he charged one of his closest co-workers, Timothy, to remain in Ephesus to help the Ephesian believers and even charge them not to teach different doctrines or teachings.
[55]  In 6:3 Paul writes again, If anyone teaches different things and does not consent to healthy words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which is according to godliness.
[56]  This is the reason that he wrote to the church in Ephesus even while he was in prison, revealing to them God s economy, which is God s working Himself through His Divine Trinity into man, in order that man would enjoy the riches of Christ to become His members and be constituted into the Body of Christ for the manifestation of the Triune God.
[57]  A little more than a year after Paul was released from prison, Nero, the Roman Caesar, began to persecute the Christians.
[58]  As we have already seen, these healthy words are the words of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament and the preaching of the Lord s apostles concerning such things as God becoming flesh and the mystery of godliness.
[59]  We need to deposit the Lord s healthy words, including the riches of life in the Lord s words, into our being, like we deposit money in the bank.
[60]  After we heard Brother Nee s fellowship, we asked why we should not invite Brother Austin-Sparks to come and visit us, since Brother Nee spoke so highly of him.
[61]  Brother Nee answered in a wise way: The time has not come.
[62]  At that time we did not quite understand what he meant.
[63]  About fifteen years later, in 1954, our work in Taiwan was very much blessed by the Lord.
[64]  Then I told them that for many years we had learned a certain thing before the Lord: In knowing a person we should not look at the big matters but at the small matters.
[65]  Recently I have felt the importance of the one accord.
[66]  As long as we have different views on a minor point, we cannot have the one accord.
[67]  This is the reason that in this training, right from the beginning, I spoke concerning the vision in the Lord s recovery.
[68]  I believe all the brothers and sisters love the Lord, and all of us want to be in one accord, but if our vision is not up to date, it is impossible for us to be one.
[69]  In the previous chapter we said that God gave men a vision even in the Old Testament age.
[70]  Yet their visions are not up to date; they do not match the age.
[71]  Throughout the ages there were many saints who loved the Lord and who feared the Lord, but we cannot say that they all had the vision that matched their age.
[72]  After he finished writing concerning the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, God s visions were complete.
[73]  Our vision is that God so loved the world that He gave His Son to die for us to redeem us, the sinners, in order that we can have the life of Christ and be regenerated by Him to be God s children, enjoying the riches of the Triune God to become the Body of Christ.
[74]  The problem among us is that some are bound by the little experience and vision that they have.
[75]  This is a remark made not only by those outside the Lord s recovery or by some who have left us but by some who are still among us.
[76]  I would like the co-workers, the elders, and all the churches in the Lord s recovery to realize that today we have not changed.
[77]  If anyone sees only a part of this entire vision and condemns us for being different, it is not merely because we are different from them; it is because they do not have the vision that matches the age.
[78]  If we study them thoroughly, we will have the full view; we will see the vision that the Lord has given us in His recovery, and we will realize what is the ultimate consummation of all the visions the New Jerusalem.
[79]  We are not only following, but we are practicing what we have seen and what we follow, which is the dispensing of the Triune God, the mingling of God and man, to become the Body of Christ to be the manifestation of the Triune God.
[80]  In our practice we must take care of the increase.
[81]  Finally we must edify and perfect the new ones to be the same as we are, practicing the Body life in all the local churches for the Lord to gain a full-grown, mature Body.
[82]  If we are faithful to the Lord in the matter of the gospel, and if we are diligent, the number of believers in the churches will greatly increase in a country as densely populated as Taiwan, but if we do not do anything, we will have nothing to say when we face the Lord.
[83]  If each of us brings one to the Lord in a year, in a short time we will reach the goal of gospelizing Taiwan, but if we all hold back our energy, how can we gospelize this country?
[84]  If we are attuned to the Lord s heart, and if we dispense the Triune God to others, imparting to them the Lord s life so that they become His members and are constituted to be His Body as His full expression, then spontaneously we will be in one accord.
[85]  In the previous three chapters, we saw clearly the vision in the Lord s recovery, the vision in the New Testament, the ultimate consummation of the visions, and the vision that matches the age.
[86]  Today we are taking the same way, doing the same work, entering the same flow, and speaking the same thing in this ultimate, consummate, and up-to-date vision.
[87]  In that book, after writing concerning many important truths, Paul says in 15:5 and 6, Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus, that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[88]  In 1:10 Paul says, Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.
[89]  In October of 1984, when I returned to Taiwan to study how to change the system, I emphasized repeatedly the need to discard the old things and adopt the new things.
[90]  In particular, I focused on the way we met and the methods with which we worked.
[91]  I also pointed out that since the practice of the new way was in its experimental stage, we were not clear about the way ahead of us.
[92]  As far as the outward fa ade is concerned, the big meetings are wonderful.
[93]  A large meeting with fourteen thousand attendants surely draws much admiration, but the wonderful feeling does not last long.
[94]  In hall one of the church in Taipei, every Lord s Day there are at least three hundred fifty people meeting.
[95]  If we practice this matter conscientiously, we can recover one dormant saint in a year, even if we cannot bring in any new people; in a year we will recover four thousand eight hundred dormant saints.
[96]  Our new system is not a one-sided arrangement; it takes care of every aspect of the church life.
[97]  First, we still keep the big Lord s Day morning meeting.
[98]  Second, the elders must work and labor diligently on the ones who come only to the big Lord s Day morning meeting and not to the small group meetings.
[99]  There is one important principle that we must keep in the small group meetings and the truth classes: Everyone must speak, but no one should preach from Truth Lessons.
[100]  In the truth classes we do not need to expand or supplement Truth Lessons.
[101]  In the small group meetings we should encourage everyone to speak.
[102]  You must trust me that everything that should be included was included when we compiled Truth Lessons, and everything that should not be there was excluded.
[103]  Since we are saved and by the Lord s mercy we are in His recovery, we should receive some basic education in the truth.
[104]  On the spiritual side, we have all seen a vision, and we know what we are doing here.
[105]  Under the same vision we are speaking the same thing, we have the same view, and we think the same thing.
[106]  Since I dropped my job in 1933 to serve the Lord full-time, I have been serving in the church life for fifty-three years.
[107]  Prayer: Lord, our heart is filled with praises toward the throne.
[108]  We worship You for calling and gathering us out of this busy age.
[109]  Lord, we ask You to visit us and bring us into Your heart s desire that we may have thorough fellowship in You.
[110]  Lord, open Yourself to us, open the heavens to us, reveal Your word to us, unveil Your economy to us, and show us what You intend to do today.
[111]  We also ask You to shine on us that we would not have anything hidden, any covering, or any shadow, but that we would be absolutely in the light and under an open sky to have open fellowship with one another through Your open word.
[112]  Lord, we ask You again to open Your will to us that we may see the way You want to take today.
[113]  Although we use the expression change the system, we are not merely changing a method or a system; rather, our purpose is to spread the Lord and His Body in His recovery in the present age.
[114]  The Lord highly regarded and blessed our early practice.
[115]  However, instead of practicing this way faithfully, we went backward to adopt the custom of the nations, and we took the old way of Christianity; hence, we ended up in the awkward situation we are in today.
[116]  But if we understand the history of the Lord s recovery, we will realize that when we first arrived in Taiwan the atmosphere and practice among us were not like what we see today.
[117]  Apparently, we have a number of activities, but actually, the new way does not depend on how many activities we have but on whether or not we have cleared away everything that is old and picked up what is new.
[118]  First, we have clearly said that no matter how much we change the system, we still should keep the big meeting on the Lord s Day morning to take care of those who like only to listen to messages and do not want to attend small group meetings.
[119]  Apart from the big Lord s Day morning meetings, there are a few meetings that allow the saints to function organically; one of them is the small group meeting.
[120]  In a small group the saints have many opportunities to carry out their function organically.
[121]  Functions such as preaching the gospel, expounding the truth, teaching the Bible, loving others, helping others, taking care of others, and sympathizing with others can be manifested and are necessary.
[122]  But because we are still accustomed to the old religion, once we see the loose situation in the small groups, we become disheartened.
[123]  Therefore, we do not consider the small groups to be important because we feel that they are not proper meetings.
[124]  Perhaps we would say that we do not have time to pay attention to these groups because we are very busy.
[125]  To say that we are so busy that we do not have time to go to the small group meeting proves that we have not seen the importance of changing the system.
[126]  If we are willing to sacrifice our future and consecrate everything to the Lord, and if we see that this is the way the Lord s recovery should take, we would give ourselves even to the point of neglecting our sleep and meals and put all our effort into taking this way and making it a success.
[127]  We all know that as human beings, we must believe in the Lord; as believers in the Lord, we must love the Lord; and as lovers of the Lord, we must take the way of the Lord s recovery.
[128]  SOME SPECIFIC PRACTICES IN CHANGING THE SYSTEM Not Focusing on the Fa ade
[129]  Now we will fellowship further on how to seriously carry out the change of system.
[130]  The way of religion is to have a Sunday service that is mainly a fa ade, but our way is to have all the saints functioning organically.
[131]  In 1965 I visited Brazil for the first time to see the situation of Christianity there.
[132]  I told them that there was a certain matter with which we could not get through in our fellowship; they do not receive all genuinely saved believers but only those who were baptized in their way.
[133]  If we want the Lord s recovery to have a way, you and I must bear the responsibility of changing our views and concepts; we need to begin with ourselves.
[134]  The elders also need to study how to make the small groups attractive to people.
[135]  The most important thing is to spend much time in prayer and study.
[136]  We can then arrange message after message from the ministry publications to lead the small groups in pursuing the truth, fellowshipping, and reading in a living way.
[137]  If the saints are not fully fed, they should at least be half fed; do not let them go home with an empty stomach.
[138]  The small group is the life pulse of the present practice of the church life.
[139]  In the past year and a half, the number of saints in the church has in fact increased, but the rate of increase is not that encouraging.
[140]  I hope that the saints will change their concept to see that the content of the church life is based mainly on small group meetings and not on big meetings.
[141]  Based on the patterns shown in the Bible, we see that if anyone is willing to open his home every week and afford his friends, relatives, and neighbors the opportunity to hear the gospel, the gospel will spread into his whole family, saving his household from sin and temper, while at the same time, bringing in much of the Lord s blessing and shining.
[142]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You that we can be here to seek Your leading.
[143]  You know that our inner being is in fear and trembling; we are afraid of losing Your presence and of either walking ahead of You or behind You.
[144]  Lord, be in our midst and give us a deep impression so that we may clearly touch, and carry out as well, all that You want us to do.
[145]  Lord, may we not regret what we are doing today; instead, may it be of eternal value.
[146]  Lord, cleanse all of us that we may exercise our spirit to receive Your leading.
[147]  Lord, we confess that we are weak, empty, and useless, and many of our activities, views, and feelings have become veils to us and restrictions, hindrances, to You.
[148]  In the past month the number of saints meeting in the small groups, that is, in the home meetings, has increased by one thousand.
[149]  I have said that once a small group has more than twelve people, it should be subdivided into two groups.
[150]  Practicing the new way is more than our obligation; this practice brings us countless benefits.
[151]  First, our delivering the meetings to the homes can be compared to sending people charcoal during a blizzard.
[152]  Suppose a certain family has been very cold toward the Lord; it has been difficult to make the members of that family burning for the Lord.
[153]  This will also affect our neighbors, colleagues, friends, and relatives because we not only preach the Lord Jesus at home, but we also testify for the Lord at work.
[154]  Those who promote any kind of movement or activity in society know that if they want to promote an activity, they must do so at the grass-roots; they cannot merely gain the husband of a household and not have any regard for his wife and children.
[155]  The result will be that the entire family will become the Lord s good soldiers who work for the Lord to preach the gospel.
[156]  Question: We have group meetings in our homes, but sometimes we also meet where we work in order to make it more convenient to bring people to the Lord and to edify the new ones.
[157]  But some of our colleagues live in places that belong to different halls.
[158]  How should we take care of the statistics and to which hall should we report the number of our small group?
[159]  This is to say that when we think we know, we are poor.
[160]  Christianity has become degraded because it has given up four crucial matters Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church and has fallen into forms, methods, organizations, and systems, which result in religion.
[161]  Had there not been the Pentateuch at the time of Moses and had the other books of the Bible not been written, we would not have the Bible today, and the world would be in an unimaginably fallen state.
[162]  We thank the Lord that no matter how much human history has been on a downward path and no matter how fallen Christianity has become, we still have the Bible.
[163]  I say this to remind you that not only at the time of Elijah, but after his time and throughout church history, God has reserved for His own name seven thousand people, even during the darkest hour of the church s degradation.
[164]  We have no intention to be proud, but we must say that since sixty years ago, when we were raised up by the Lord in China, we have had this burden and desire within us.
[165]  In general, while Christianity is on a downward trend, the Lord s recovery is on an upward trend.
[166]  Yet I hope that we will realize that sometimes we are a little too much; we have delayed the Lord s business in this way.
[167]  On the one hand, we cannot say that during all these years our spiritual stature has remained stunted.
[168]  To be honest, however, our growth has been very slow.
[169]  If we provide opportunity for it to fall into the earth, if we till the earth so that the seed can go deep into the soil, and if we allow water, air, and sunlight to work on it, it will surely grow and bear fruit.
[170]  In the summer of 1933 one seeker of the Lord came to me in the evening at about seven or eight o clock.
[171]  Because it was hot and my home was close to the sea, we went for a walk by the beach.
[172]  After we arrived at the beach, we sat down, and he began to ask me about the truth concerning baptism.
[173]  At that time I was already enlightened by the Lord concerning this truth.
[174]  If we exercise control, we will frustrate the Lord, but if we do not control, we will actually help the Lord.
[175]  We should pay attention to one thing in this new practice; that is, we should be for vitality rather than uniformity.
[176]  According to our experience, if we do not prepare some material, and if we do not have the Lord s word, everyone will be free to speak what he wants to, and the freedom will degenerate into confusion.
[177]  CHAPTER EIGHT CRUCIAL ASPECTS OF THE HOME MEETINGS CRUCIAL POINTS REQUIRING OUR ATTENTION
[178]  In the previous chapter, we spoke about dividing the four hundred home meetings in the church in Taipei into a thousand smaller units.
[179]  On the one hand, I am for this, but on the other hand, I am somewhat concerned about this.
[180]  If we are not diligent, persistent, and proper in this practice, we will kill everything.
[181]  The church in Taipei has now been practicing the small group meetings for more than a year and a half.
[182]  Everywhere there were complaints that this way does not work and that the saints were dying.
[183]  As long as we have the Lord s word and as long as we have His Spirit, there will be life, and life will enliven men.
[184]  Do not think that the big meetings are better than the small meetings.
[185]  Do not say, We have been elders for so long, and the situation has been so prosperous all this time.
[186]  Now that we are broken up into small meetings, nothing seems to be working properly anymore.
[187]  If we were with the Lord, we might have said, Lord Jesus, we heard of Your name, and we were told that You have a very successful work.
[188]  I hope that we will have the boldness and the confidence to open our mouth to speak for the Lord.
[189]  We must not be afraid, and we must not be shy.
[190]  Such are not the attitudes of one who is serving the Lord.
[191]  What I mean is that when we go to a home meeting, we should fire up the meeting.
[192]  We must have a strong determination that anytime we go to a meeting, we must light a fire in that meeting.
[193]  I say this to show that we are not qualified to do the Lord s work if our intention is to wait for all things to be ready before we preach the gospel.
[194]  Concerning the home meetings, we must pay attention to three things.
[195]  First, all the elders, co-workers, and full-timers should learn to minister God s word to the home meetings at every opportune time.
[196]  We must believe that not only every word in the Bible is God s word but that all the truths we have released according to the Bible are also the Lord s present speaking.
[197]  THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY MAKING THE CHURCH LIFE
[198]  In the past our church life has been too dead, and not many people have functioned.
[199]  Although such a practice is not a burden, it requires much labor.
[200]  I hope that the young full-timers would have the understanding that it is a joy to consecrate ourselves to the Lord.
[201]  Yet we must not think that we have consecrated ourselves to be a spiritual giant with a great name and a large following.
[202]  The Lord may be gracious to us, and He may make us such a person one day.
[203]  If we want to serve the Lord and work for Him, we should begin from the homes.
[204]  Since the church is led by the Lord to practice the home meetings, we need to consider the homes as the goal of our work.
[205]  If the elders, co-workers, and full-timers in the Lord s recovery will pick up this burden, and if all the churches and all the halls will practice this, that is, to sort out the records and charge the brothers and sisters to take action together, the impact will be tremendous.
[206]  A year and a half ago, we spoke about the matter of producing full-time serving ones.
[207]  At that time, based on our experience and through our observation and study of the ways in which Christians have served throughout the centuries, we were convinced that we could not take the way of organization.
[208]  But if we do not take the organizational way and instead take the way of following the Lord absolutely, we must be watchful moment by moment, and we need to exercise diligent care and oversight.
[209]  In this chapter we will speak about the principles of the home meetings, which are everyone speaking, no one assuming the headship, and every home having a meeting.
[210]  In order to have everyone speaking, we need to begin with the training meetings of the co-workers and elders.
[211]  This training of the co-workers and elders has continued for five or six weeks, yet the more we have met, the more silent many of us have become, and I have become the de facto head.
[212]  It would be contrary to spiritual principle to ask all the saints to speak when we ourselves remain silent in the co-workers and elders meetings.
[213]  If I were to ask today whether or not we want to maintain the Lord s Day morning meeting as we have in the past, we may all say yes.
[214]  A nation is not built upon a school or a club; its foundation is the homes.
[215]  If we do not change our concept, and if we think that the new way is merely a change of method, from managing big meetings to managing small meetings, from managing small meetings to managing home meetings, and if we think that this can be accomplished easily by mere arrangements, we will find ourselves facing nothing but failure.
[216]  The co-workers and elders must also strengthen their prayer.
[217]  We need to consider this matter as a burden and pray for it.
[218]  We must pray by fasting, saying, Lord, You must turn the church around absolutely from the old way of Christianity.
[219]  If we do not work on the homes, and if we do not stir up every home, how can we answer to the Lord, and how can we answer to all the saints?
[220]  Recently I took some time to observe the teaching of the truth classes in hall one in Taipei.
[221]  On the one hand, the brothers took my word and stayed away from free expounding, keeping themselves instead to teaching the text.
[222]  On the other hand, as the brothers have followed my words, they have become somewhat robotic ; they no longer act according to the leading of the Spirit.
[223]  AND HOW TO TEACH TRUTH LESSONS THE PRACTICE AND PROGRESS OF THE NEW WAY
[224]  In this chapter we will continue to fellowship about the practice of the home meetings and the teaching of Truth Lessons.
[225]  As a result of the last few meetings, we have seen some results.
[226]  Such a practice involves an effort on the part of the co-workers and the elders.
[227]  We must carefully select the proper material for the home meetings.
[228]  We need to spend an adequate amount of time to pray thoroughly, to observe the condition of the brothers and sisters, and to understand the need of all the homes and the groups.
[229]  One point needs special attention: In selecting the reading material, we should precede each portion with a few crucial verses.
[230]  Every time we meet together, we should first have the attendants pray-read the verses.
[231]  This will plant the Lord s word into man s heart.
[232]  We hope that those who come to the meeting will receive nourishment and truth and will testify that we are here for the spreading of the gospel and the presenting of the truth.
[233]  He spoke about the Lord Jesus from eternity past, passing through His creation, incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, enthronement, coming back, and receiving the kingdom, all the way to eternity future His years being without end. If we read the Bible carefully, we will find that even though the Gospels are rich in content, some matters related to Christ are not spoken of as clearly as in David s prophecy.
[234]  IN THE LORD S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Rom 16:5, 10-15, 23 THE HISTORY OF THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY
[235]  One and a half years ago the Lord granted us a new direction in His leading as a means to turn ourselves fully away from the way of traditional Christianity.
[236]  I believe when we put these words into practice, we will see that while we still have the big meetings, our way of carrying them out is entirely different from the way of the denominations.
[237]  We all need to learn how to have meetings with people in their homes.
[238]  We should learn to go to people s homes to have meetings with them.
[239]  If they do not know how to have a meeting, we should lead them and teach them to do it.
[240]  Every time we contact the Lord, and every time we touch anything concerning the Lord, we need to confess our sins and ask Him for His cleansing.
[241]  When we go to a meeting, that is, when we deliver a meeting to a person s home, the minute we come and the minute we open our mouth, we need to exercise our spirit.
[242]  Every Lord s Day I go to a different hall to observe the teaching of Truth Lessons.
[243]  I feel that all the brothers are making progress everywhere.
[244]  However, it seems that we are still not thoroughly clear about how to teach the main points of the lessons, and we do not know the secret of teaching.
[245]  In the past I implored that we not expound but only teach the lessons.
[246]  We need to realize that the way the Lord is taking is to build up His church in the believers homes.
[247]  Once that happens, we can invite our relatives to the home meetings, and they will see the situation in our homes and will be touched to receive the Lord s salvation.
[248]  I hope that all the churches in Taiwan will call on the Lord desperately for the sake of His interest on the earth to touch the government officials and grant the authorities the wisdom to see that this building will be beneficial to our nation, our people, our society, our economy, Taiwan s foreign relations, and even our people s foreign relationships, so that they will gladly and promptly grant us the permission to fulfill this matter.
[249]  While resting these few days, I have felt that we have neglected the spiritual warfare, caring only for the work, because we have been busy with our work and busy following the new move under the Lord s leading.
[250]  When we are busy with the Lord s work, we must realize that we are engaged in a spiritual warfare.
[251]  Lord, release our spirit, give us the burden, and enable us to receive the burden and to stretch out our hands in faith to touch Your throne of authority.
[252]  Lord, we believe that Your church needs the land in Lin-ko.
[253]  Lord, we are not asking this for ourselves or merely for the church, we are asking this for You and Your interest.
[254]  If we do know how to teach, we surely should teach, but even if we do not know how to teach, we still must teach, because elders should be apt to teach 1 Tim 3:2 .
[255]  BEING A SERVICE OF WARFARE Scripture Reading: Num 4:3; 26:2; Neh 4:15-23; 1 Tim 1:18; 6:12; 2 Tim 4:7; Eph 6:13-14a
[256]  During the past one and a half years we have been speaking concerning the building up of the small groups, the home meetings, the teaching of Truth Lessons, and the preaching of the gospel.
[257]  I am concerned that we have become indifferent to these matters because of the frequency of our speaking on them.
[258]  Therefore, I received a burden from the Lord to remind all of us that our work is a spiritual warfare.
[259]  Although these three offices or ministries were different, their goal and center were the same to build up God s temple and His kingdom, in other words, to build up God s house and His city.
[260]  Today in the Lord s recovery, we should clearly see that we are not merely doing a work of recovery recovering the truth, the gospel, the experience of Christ as life, and building up the church.
[261]  The recovery of the building in the Old Testament was fully accomplished by and through warfare.
[262]  In the New Testament the Lord Jesus said that the gates of Hades, which belong to Satan, would never prevail against the built-up church Matt 16:18 .
[263]  He speaks about the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the counterpart of Christ, the new man, God s house, and God s kingdom.
[264]  We must be clear that the changing of the system, the spreading, and the increase are not the basic issue.
[265]  A local church may have three thousand people, thirty thousand, or even three million people; however, what is the foundation upon which the churches in the Lord s recovery are based?
[266]  At the present time in Taiwan, my goal, on the one hand, is to study how to advance in the new move with the co-workers and elders.
[267]  On the other hand, I have a great burden to work on the Recovery Version of the New Testament in Chinese.
[268]  It has been difficult to have a proper version of the Bible for our meetings.
[269]  Such a one would need much spiritual education and should know theology as well as spiritual terminology and expressions, such as the Triune God, the person of Christ, God s dispensing, God s economy, the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit, and others.
[270]  Of course, for the spreading of the gospel, the teaching of the truth, the ministering of life, and the building up of the church, we still need some full-time serving ones.
[271]  For this reason, the support for the full-timers is very crucial.
[272]  I would rather sacrifice the big meeting hall in Lin-ko than neglect the need of the full-timers.
[273]  We must have a strong resolution within ourselves that even if we must sell everything, we need to increase the number of full-timers.
[274]  I feel that even if we must sell the land in Lin-ko, and even if we must borrow a few million dollars from other places, we need to do it to continue supporting the full-timers.
[275]  I have now been in Taiwan for almost three months, and I have tried my best to go to different meeting halls each Lord s Day to see how we are teaching Truth Lessons.
[276]  On one occasion when I met with the elders, I spoke a few words to them, but I did not pour out all of my inward feelings because I never want to tell people what to do without first doing it myself.
[277]  We must be persons who are burning in spirit and crazy before God.
[278]  Whether we are visiting the communities or going to a meeting, we must prepare ourselves by first being crazy at home.
[279]  Concerning the teaching of Truth Lessons, the first thing we must remember is that we are not teaching a class in the public schools, we are teaching Truth Lessons in the church.
[280]  This is altogether a matter of life and spirit.
[281]  As teachers of Truth Lessons, we need to pay attention to this one thing: we should not dress sloppily; rather, we should dress neatly and properly.
[282]  We need to dress as if we are delivering gifts to people s homes.
[283]  If we do not tuck in our shirt and do not wear a tie when we bring a meeting to people s homes, they will think that the meeting we bring is not valuable.
[284]  First Corinthians 15:58 says, Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
[285]  Before speaking about the truth of resurrection, Paul first testified about the grace and his labor: By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me v. 10 . Paul said that through the work of grace he had become an extraordinary man.
[286]  He was able to labor more abundantly to bring God s economy to His children, not by himself but through the grace of God which was with him.
[287]  I said that we should not only pick up the burden to ensure that the churches in the Lord s recovery increase in number but that the recovery as a whole would spread throughout the entire island of Taiwan.
[288]  I felt that this was the time for us to receive the Lord s commission to pick up this burden once again and do everything we could to spread the gospel, the truth, and the churches throughout the entire island of Taiwan.
[289]  TO REALIZE THIS GLORIOUS FUTURE Building Up the Home Meetings
[290]  What should we do to bring in this glorious future and reach our goal?
[291]  First, the elders in every local church should pick up the burden to build up the meetings in the saints homes.
[292]  Second, the elders must build up the truth-teaching meetings.
[293]  These meetings must become the center of all the meetings.
[294]  In these meetings we must not only teach the truth but also help the saints to meet.
[295]  I hope we will overturn the Chinese disposition, which is to be nice and polite when sitting in a meeting.
[296]  Even if everyone decided to visit hell, there would be no disagreement; at the most there might be an oblique suggestion to visit heaven instead.
[297]  When the elders come together, they can talk and debate about everything, but in the end everyone must be in one accord to carry out the decision.
[298]  Please remember that we are not serving merely as elders in our own little halls; we are serving as one of the elders of the entire church in conjunction with eighty other brothers.
[299]  However, I have seen a vision and have received a burden to release the truth in the Lord s recovery item by item.
[300]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN A SUMMARY OF THE FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING OUR PRACTICE
[301]  Lord, we offer up our worship, thanksgiving, and praise for Your recovery, for Your move among us, and for Your leading.
[302]  Building up the home meetings in every believer s home is the first and foremost thing in our new beginning.
[303]  As long as a person is a believer, he is our brother in the Lord, even if he is the weakest, coldest, and most indifferent, backslidden person.
[304]  I said from the beginning that the small group is the foundation for the building up of the church, and that such a small group must be built upon the foundation of the home meetings.
[305]  Based on this, we were bold to say that we must have the small meetings, the group meetings, not only the big meetings.
[306]  In the new leading of the Lord, we first build up everything related to the church in the homes and not in the meeting halls.
[307]  We should depend on knocking on people s doors and visiting them one by one and not on the big meetings.
[308]  Second, we feel that God s desire is to raise up a group of people who are full of life and truth.
[309]  When we initially received this new leading from the Lord, we emphatically pointed out that we have enjoyed much blessing from the Lord in Taiwan.
[310]  However, for forty years we have not saturated the entire island with the gospel.
[311]  Where in Christianity can we find another group of people who have received as much truth from the Lord as we have?
[312]  Prayer: Lord, we love Your dwelling place, which is Your Body, Your church.
[313]  May Your presence be with us in the depths of our being so that we would not become an organization but would move together with You in one accord as Your organic Body.
[314]  Lord, thank You that You have Your testimony here in Taiwan, and thank You for entrusting this testimony to us and showing us the clear vision and the great commission.
[315]  We want to enter into a deeper fellowship with You, to touch Your heart s desire in a more practical way, and to be enlightened concerning the details of how we should go on.
[316]  Just as You have visited us, cared for us, touched us, and moved within us, we ask You to do the same work within all the saints so that they will have the inner registration, the inner enlightening of their eyes, to clearly see the vision and to see the vanity of this world.
[317]  It is easy for man to have a biased understanding of the Bible.
[318]  When we consider creation around us and as we study the Bible, we find that under God s sovereignty everything physical and spiritual is not one-sided.
[319]  However, if we dive into God s word and dig into its depths, we will see that our God is very consistent, yet He is not simple.
[320]  When we read the New Testament carefully, especially the Gospels and Acts, we find that both the Lord and the disciples worked with plans and arrangements.
[321]  The Lord had a schedule and a plan; He did not pass His days on earth foolishly and carelessly.
[322]  In Luke 13 the Pharisees threatened the Lord, saying, Get out and go from here, for Herod wants to kill you.
[323]  The Lord answered, saying, Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and accomplish healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I am perfected.
[324]  At present we have more than two hundred sixty young people in our full-time training.
[325]  I hope that all the saints will be faithful to the Lord to make up the portion that they ought to cover so that the Lord s work can go on in a smooth way.
[326]  IN IMPLEMENTING THE NEW WAY 2 CONCERNING THE FULL-TIME TRAINING
[327]  Let us now fellowship further regarding the schedule and budget needed to practically implement the new way.
[328]  First, concerning the full-timers, we need to realize that they must be trained.
[329]  We are not operating a seminary; rather, we are being trained in various matters, such as being equipped in the truth, growing in life, carrying out the Lord s work, leading the meetings, establishing churches in different cities, and shepherding the saints.
[330]  Otherwise, when people look at us they will wonder what kind of God we have, and what kind of persons we are; they will question why do we not have an attitude of fear and respect toward our God.
[331]  We have included some language classes in the full-time training.
[332]  This is for the preparation of the gospelization of Taiwan and the whole earth.
[333]  After we have gospelized the island of Taiwan, some full-timers will be sent abroad, in particular to South America, Africa, Australasia, Japan, and Korea.
[334]  If all the churches in Taiwan are one and all the saints endeavor together in one accord, producing as many full-timers as possible and giving as much as possible, the Lord s grace will enable us to reach our goal of having one thousand full-timers to evangelize Taiwan in five years.
