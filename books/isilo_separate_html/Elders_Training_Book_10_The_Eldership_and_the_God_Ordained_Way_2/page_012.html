In the elders' training in February 1986, my burden was to ask the elders to take care of the one accord in the Lord's recovery. More than four hundred brothers signed a letter written to me, assuring me that they would endeavor to keep the one accord (see Elders' Training, Book 8, The Life-pulse of the Lord's Present Move, pp. 154-155, published by Living Stream Ministry). But in the past three years of rebellion, a few brothers condemned that letter and even said that a part of that letter is heretical. Two of them wrote to tell me that they would remove their signatures from that letter. This shows that either they were not clear about the real meaning of the one accord or they despised it.</P><P>The above-mentioned factors of division hidden in the past are a strong proof that there was a negligence regarding the keeping of the one accord in the Lord's recovery. The present turmoil among us is not a matter of right or wrong, but an issue and a full manifestation of this negligence. This manifestation has progressed to the extent that some of the rebellious ones told people definitely that they will fight until they put me down. This shows strongly that they would not care for the one accord. This is surely a hidden factor of division.</P><P>The present turmoil among us did not develop in only one day. Ice in a river accumulates over a period of time before it becomes several feet thick. In the same way, in our situation there has been a certain amount of accumulation of unpleasant things over a number of years. At the beginning I had no realization concerning any opposition or criticism, because I was busy in Taipei. But when I came back in December 1987 and the brothers came to make certain demands according to their plan, I began to realize that something was terribly wrong. Their plan was actually their conspiracy.</P><P>In principle, turmoil and problems among the Lord's people come from two sources, a human source and a satanic source. After observing and considering the situation among us over the past three years, I believe that this turmoil is initiated by Satan, the evil one, the enemy (Matt. 13:19, 28). It is something from the realm of darkness to destroy the ministry and to shut the door to the new way. Satan hates the ministry, and he also hates the new way. The ministry with the new way is the great blockade to the enemy in his evil device, so Satan and the evil spirits moved quite strongly to do something. As a result, some of the brothers were captured and used by the evil spirits to do things which are altogether illogical, unreasonable, and inhuman. They told people that I am old, I am no longer able to judge things clearly. This is a lie. All such things show strongly that this turmoil is of the devil.</P><P>However, in spite of the turmoil, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, most of the churches around the globe are still going on positively. The reports of their present situation, given by their elders who were present in the elders' meetings, are quite encouraging. These reports are printed separately as a book entitled The Present Situation of the Churches in the Recovery throughout the World.
