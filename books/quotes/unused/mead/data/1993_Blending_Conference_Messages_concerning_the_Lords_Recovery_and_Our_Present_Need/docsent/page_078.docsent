   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CRUCIAL NEED AMONG US TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to be stirred up by the Lord so that we can cooperate with Him to go higher.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have attained to a certain extent, but we have not attained to the extent which we should, so we must humble ourselves to learn something and be improved every day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Learning to Speak</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In these days we are taking the God-ordained way to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The big item in the church life is the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Especially, we need to learn how to take care of the Lord's need in our speaking of His word in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those in traditional Christianity do not consider that all the saints are qualified to speak the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, they have set up a clerical class of people to be the unique speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every Sunday morning in their main service, they have a practice of one person speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Christian could be there for his whole life listening to this speaking for many years and eventually not be able to speak a word for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a poor situation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of practice annuls the spiritual function of the saints and quenches their heart to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, this kind of practice is absolutely unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the New Testament, especially in 1 Corinthians 14, we are told that when we all come together as the church, everyone should prepare to have something to share with the others v. 26 . There is a picture of this in the ancient times with the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When they came together to worship the Lord, they all brought some surplus of the good land to present to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The holy word in the Old Testament charged them not to appear before God empty-handed, without anything to present to God Deut 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But today most Christians come to their main service with nothing, expecting that someone will be there to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is altogether not based upon the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>About fifty-five years ago, Brother Watchman Nee saw the light from 1 Corinthians 14 that before we come to the meeting, we should have something prepared to present to the Lord and to the attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, everybody should have some word to speak to others, to minister the Lord to others, that Christ may be glorified and His Body may be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Nee also realized that if we stopped the one-man-speaking practice, we would need something to replace it or we would not have anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time we were not able to enter into the practice of the church meetings in mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, beginning in 1987 we began in Taipei to enter into the practice of having church meetings in mutuality with all the attendants speaking for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since that time we have seen a slow improvement among us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This improvement has become an encouragement to us, especially to me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some may feel that the new way is all right but not that good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But as long as this new way would not reduce us but give us some increase at a good percentage, we should be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the end of 1988 there were approximately one thousand five hundred sixty saints in Southern California.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today there are approximately three thousand one hundred eighty saints here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is double the number of what we were five years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows that during the period of time in which we have been endeavoring to take the God-ordained way, we have still had the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since we are practicing the God-ordained way, the new way, we must learn to speak because speaking in the meeting is a vital thing for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all need to be perfected to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we speak in a larger meeting, we must speak loudly, audibly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, in order to speak we all need to learn something.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have over one hundred various kinds of dictionaries that I use to help me in studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have one dictionary on the history of the church which is very helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am saying this to impress us that we need a learning spirit if we want to be those who speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since we love the Lord and love His recovery, we must take the way to have the proper and adequate meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first item we must pursue for this is prophesying 1 Cor 14:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Prophesying is not only speaking but also speaking rightly, speaking accurately, speaking audibly, and speaking with something rich.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why we have to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not have any learning, we cannot have the riches to impart to others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our speaking should also be adjusted in its rhythm.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we speak too slowly we can exhaust others' patience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we speak too fast, others will not be able to understand us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I hope we would exercise ourselves to learn to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I was thirty-two years old, I stood in front of a mirror to practice my speaking and my gestures.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I also practiced speaking to members of my family.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We love the Lord and many of us are young, so we have a long way to go in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we learn to speak accurately, adequately, properly, and richly to meet the Lord's need, we will be greatly used by the Lord and bring in much blessing to the churches.</S>
