Prayer: Lord, we thank You for Your sovereignty, and we thank You for Your sovereign grace that we may have this training
The small group is the practice of perfecting the saints revealed in Ephesians 4:12; hence, it is a great thing
After the sixteen weeks of training are completed, when you go, another group of new trainees will come to continue the work
According to spiritual sequence, life should be first and the new way second, but according to my burden, the new way should be first
Some have said that the full-time training in Taipei was a 'Hagar' and that all the ones baptized through door-knocking were 'Ishmaels'
Concerning the new way, we will spend some time to look into the new way, and we will also talk about the exercise of the new way
There are many different kinds of life, such as that of the mosquitos, termites, ants, wolves, dogs, and tigers
Have you ever heard that this eternal life is eternal not only in time but also in quality substance element factor and even in its source
Peter's life and work made the divine life so real and present in his situation; hence, it was the word of his testimony
In order to know the significance of the tree of life, we must consider the background of chapters one and two of the book of Genesis
Outwardly, in appearance, man bears God's image and has God's likeness , and inwardly, God's breath has entered into man
By looking at the usage of the word neshamah in these two verses, we can see that when the breath was with God it was a breath
Genesis 1 and 2 show us that man is outwardly made in Gods image according to Gods likeness and that inwardly he is filled with Gods breath
Before man could eat of the tree of life, the Bible tells us that Satan the Devil, through the serpent, distracted man
In Genesis 2 man was placed before the tree of life, and in the Gospel of John we are told to eat Jesus, who is the tree of life
In Revelation 2:7, after the churches had become degraded, the Lord came in to call the overcomers to eat the tree of life
After being received by us, this life will live out all kinds of divine, spiritual, and heavenly things in an unlimited way
Colossians 2:19, 1 Corinthians 3:6-7 and 9, and 1 Peter 2:2 are the best verses in the New Testament related to the growth in life
If we eat life, we will receive life and will become life, but if we eat death, we will not only die but will become death
To believe is to put the branch which has been cut off into Christ as the cultivated tree full of rich life-juice
When the other branches from the wild tree are grafted into this cultivated tree, it increases from ten branches to one hundred branches
God can get into man only because man has something that has come out of God, the breath of God, which became man's spirit
If they do this, they will exercise their spirit, and when they exercise their spirit, God will have a way to enter into them
When the Lord raised up new light among us, the new way, and brought us into it, a certain number of arguments were aroused
When we preach the gospel in this deeper way, we do not touch the 'flesh and bone' of man; we touch the spirit of man
In the New Testament, there are four main verses-two in the Gospels and two in the Epistles-which reveal the matter of living Christ
In the New Testament, John 6:57 and 14:19 are the most basic verses in unveiling to us how we can live because of Christ and with Christ
The third verse, perhaps the best in the Epistles concerning our living because of Christ and with Christ, is Galatians 2:20
We do not live by Christ, taking Christ as our instrument; rather, we live because of Christ, taking Christ as a factor of our living
In using a cane as an instrument to walk, there is no need to eat the cane; but to live because of food, we must eat the food
If our Christian life is an exchanged life, then our poor life is finished after being exchanged with the life of Christ
When the Bible says that we have been crucified, this means that we have been cut off from Adam, the uncultivated tree
We are not living in ourselves, we are living in Christ, with Christ, and because of Christ, taking Christ as the factor for our living
Before we were saved, our soul was our person, and our spirit was merely an organ for us to contact and receive God
When we were saved, receiving Christ as the life-giving Spirit into our spirit, our spirit became our new person, a new man
Our soul has been rejected as the person, but our soul is still useful as an organ for our new man, the regenerated spirit
To love by our soul as our person is wrong, but to love by our spirit as our person with our soul as our organ is right
He did not love by the soul as His person; rather, He loved by His spirit as His person with His soul as His organ
When our soul rises up to be our person, we should tell our soul: 'Dear soul, you were my person in the past, but not today
Today, you are my organ in resurrection, and my person is my regenerated spirit with the Lord Jesus as its life
After we received Christ, He did not only regenerate our spirit, but He also uplifted our mind, emotion, and will through His resurrection
Romans 6:5 says, 'For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection'
Question: My concept has been that the life of the soul and the faculties of the soul are two different things
The life of the soul needs to be denied, but the faculties of the soul, including the mind, emotion, and will, need to be preserved
The glove has five fingers, but these five fingers only have the image of the fingers, not the reality of the fingers
When the hand enters into the glove, then the fingers of the hand become the content of the fingers of the glove
When Christ comes into us with His mind, emotion, and will, His faculties become the very content of our human mind, emotion, and will
Man was made as an empty vessel in order to receive God as his portion, that is, as his life, life supply, and everything
Whether one has received God or is an atheist, not willing to receive Him, he must admit that man is the masterpiece of God's creation
An insect's life is not as high as a dog's life, and a dog's life is not as strong as the lives of higher animals
If we are not clear about the principle of grafting, we will not be able to properly apprehend the matter of life
The human life has the divine life within it as its content, and the divine life has the human life as its expression
The interest rate is always on his mind, and he is always looking at the newspaper to find out what the current interest rate is
Our mind should be concentrated on Christ, but this concentration of our mind depends upon our love for Christ
If we do not love Christ, we cannot live Him, and loving Him is the best way to concentrate our entire being on Him
Christ is our life, but Christ as our life is practical to us when we set our mind on the spirit, and our mind is life
To abide in Christ, taking Christ as the Spirit, is to set our mind on the mingled spirit, our regenerated spirit
In Matthew 16 when Peter rebuked the Lord, saying, 'God be merciful to You, Lord,' Jesus turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind Me, Satan'!
We condemn ourselves that we are wrong in our attitude and wrong in the way we speak, in the inaccurate words we use
With this person of life, there is a law, the law of the Spirit of life, that frees us from the law of sin and death
The law of the Spirit of life , the law of good in the mind , and the law of sin and death are natural laws, not outward regulating laws
An airplane can fly against the power of gravity only because the law of aerodynamics overcomes the law of gravity
When a believer returns to the standing of an unbeliever under the law, trying to do good to please God, he experiences Romans 7
Throughout the years Bible students have argued whether Romans 7 is the experience of an unbeliever or of a Christian
In the morning they may have a morning revival, and after this revival they make up their mind to be perfect for the whole day
That night they may try to make restitution, confessing their failures, and the next morning they will try again
Before Adam and Eve took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were innocent; there was no sin
If we declare that we are wretched and hopeless and cannot do anything to rescue ourselves, then we are declaring that we need a Savior
Question: If in our fallen nature we are Satan, how can we live a grafted life with the Lord flowing through us to express Himself?
Joshua and Caleb said, 'Only do not rebel against Jehovah; and do not fear the people of the land, for they will be our bread'
When we go to visit people we must learn to speak Christ to speak by the Spirit that is to minister Christ the Spirit of life into them
While we are going out to speak to people we need to be praying: 'Lord, regardless of how good my word is, it is vanity
The Spirit today is a compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30, which was compounded with four spices and olive oil
Without such types in the Old Testament it would be difficult to understand the different aspects of the one Spirit in the New Testament
According to biblical theology, many new terms such as God's New Testament economy have been introduced in the recent years
In verses 9 through 11, the terms 'the Spirit of God,' 'the Spirit of Christ,' and 'Christ' are used interchangeably
Our spirit has been made life, our mind, which is the main part of the soul, becomes life, and even our dying body will also be life
If you open your mouth and say, 'O Lord Jesus,' believing in your heart that God raised Him from among the dead, He will get inside of you'
The cases of Lazarus in John 11 and the dying child in John 4 indicate that fallen human beings are not only sinful but also dead
We have to believe that we are not going merely to preach but to impart the living Christ who is life into people
The regenerating Spirit who is life came into our spirit, becoming one with our regenerated spirit and making our spirit life
Their spirit was touched by us when we preached the gospel to them; otherwise, they would not have let us baptize them in their bathtub
As we are preaching the gospel, we know with full assurance that Christ is in our spirit and that our spirit is life
Since we have this mysterious God within us, we should not think that we are so weak, unable to overcome sin such as our bad temper
Regardless of our present situation, we always have to believe that we are able to overcome all kinds of situations
When we go to preach the gospel to others in a dynamic way, we are experiencing Christ, the Triune God, and life
Romans 8 speaks about the processed Triune God as the Spirit of life dispensing Himself into the transformed tripartite man
To eat several meals a day is right, but most people eat according to their flesh, that is, according to themselves
We must learn to experience Christ to such an extent that we would not even allow our body to do good things apart from the Spirit
Question: We have seen that we should follow the trained way in preaching the gospel, and we have also seen that we should be flexible
When we hear a Christian teacher talking about the 'tongue,' we like to make every part of our face a 'tongue'
The Chinese have been very conservative for many centuries, but they have gradually changed their concept since coming to Taiwan
If we live in a neighborhood with a few men who are fond of fishing, it may even be necessary to go fishing with them
After we go fishing with them three times, they will thoroughly open to us, and we will have an opening in their community
Question: Is there literature available that categorizes people for gospel preaching and can help us to reach different kinds of people?
If we only preach the gospel to them, they may be saved, but if we do not come to them, they can never be fully brought to the Lord
Thank the Lord that today there are many new ones among us because of the door-knocking, and some new churches have been raised up
In incarnation the Son is the Father's embodiment, and the Spirit is the divine essence of the Son's incarnation
We have the Father, embodied in the Son, consummated as the Spirit, and embodied in the word, reaching us to be our life
The Spirit in the New Testament denotes not only the Spirit of God and the Holy Spirit but also the consummated Spirit
The law of the Spirit of life is not a law in letters, like the Ten Commandments, regulating us concerning good and evil
The law of gravity is not a commandment in letters but a natural force, a natural law, which operates according to a principle
Three days after His crucifixion, He entered into resurrection; thus, another element, resurrection, was also added to Him
As the 'raw God,' He was life only to Himself, but as the processed God, the 'cooked God,' He can be life to us
Romans 8:6, another crucial verse, says, 'The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace'
The way to apply this salvation is not to have our being according to the flesh but to live according to the spirit
If we live according to the flesh, we are about to die; but if we live according to the mingled spirit, we shall live
We Christians, however, have both the negative provision of our flesh and the positive provision of the mingled spirit
What is the difference between His being resurrection and the element of resurrection being added into the Triune God in resurrection?
A circle is often used to illustrate eternity or eternal things because it has no beginning point or ending point
When the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection occurred in time makes no difference in the divine realm, which is outside of time
Answer: First, it should not be a matter of setting our mind on the spirit; it should be a matter of our mind being on the spirit
We must have a clear view that we are fallen people who have been saved; therefore, we have two kinds of provisions
The first is the negative provision of the old man, and the other is the positive provision of the new man, the mingled spirit
We may not be so clear that we are living according to the spirit, but we know for certain when we are living according to the flesh
As long as we know that we are living according to the flesh, we know that we are not living according to the spirit
As you read these items of the divine theology again and again, one day you will be enlightened to see clearly how to experience Christ
Before we came into the Lord's recovery, we might not have had any knowledge concerning the switch of the mingled spirit
Verse 11 presents the view that the Spirit of life as the processed Triune God indwells you to give life to your body
Whether you are about to die or live depends upon whether you live according to the flesh or according to the spirit
We must learn not to live according to the old man, the flesh, but to live according to the spirit, the new man
The link between our spirit at one end and the heavens at the other end can be compared to Jacob's dream at Bethel
Some who love the Lord and love the Word may not know the proper teaching concerning the dividing of soul and spirit
When Paul wrote the book of Hebrews, many Hebrew believers were lingering on the border between Judaism and God's New Testament economy
In Hebrews 4 Paul showed the believers how to have their soul divided from their spirit through the reading and understanding of the Word
By taking the word, they were able to see that they should come out of Judaism and follow their spirit and not their soul
In human society today, many things are confused, but before God nothing is confused; everything is clear and divided
We learn to discern the difference between our soul and spirit, and we learn to discern our intents and thoughts
On the other hand, if we do not love the Lord and are far away from Him, we will not be able to discern the source of our words
Verse 14 says Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast the confession
He ascended to the heavens to present Himself to God in the freshness of His resurrection to satisfy the Father
He descended to the disciples in order to enter into them to be their life and their everything for their satisfaction
The more we speak in this way, the more we enjoy the heavens, the throne of grace, and the very coinhering God
His concern was not for his bonds but for how the enjoyment of Christ among the Philippians could be increased
Even in tasks such as arranging plants in a house or hanging pictures on the wall, there is a certain way, a secret, to doing them
As Christians we should enjoy Christ as our life our living our pattern our expression our goal our seeking our strength and our secret
The way for us to enjoy and experience Christ as all of these items is through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
If we want to enjoy Christ and experience Christ, there is no other way except by the all-inclusive Spirit as our bountiful supply
The Apostle Paul also enjoyed Christ even in the face of martyrdom through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
If you pray for a job and the Lord gives you a job, you may be happy and say that your getting a job is your salvation
On the other hand, suppose you lose your job and, being unable to find a job, have to look for two or three months
To forgive anyone's offense to the extent that you forget requires the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
There are many millions of Christians in America, but we may not often be able to recognize them since not many are living Christ
After receiving this excellent knowledge by revelation, he still sought a further knowledge, a knowledge not by revelation but by experience
We may have the excellency of the knowledge of certain foods by looking at a menu, but we may never have tasted them
Verse 10 says, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
The reality of the power of Christ's resurrection is the Spirit , and the bountiful supply of the Spirit is the power of resurrection
As we have seen, this power is the person of Christ, and Christ today is the Spirit of Jesus Christ who is in our spirit
Not only are our marriage life and family life the mold of the cross, but even the church life becomes the mold of the cross to us
If Paul failed to magnify Christ, that would be a shame to him; but if he magnified Christ, this would be his salvation
Between husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, there are a lot of murmurings and reasonings
Doing things without murmurings and doing things without reasonings are two elements of salvation which we have to work out
In such a generation we as children of God, having God's life and nature, 'shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life'
To be found in Christ, having the righteousness which is of God based upon faith, is to have God Himself embodied in Christ as righteousness
The righteousness of God based upon faith in chapter three is the Christ we must live and magnify in chapter one
Being found in Christ, he would have no goodness of himself, but the righteousness of God, who is Christ as the embodiment of God
Chapter one deals with salvation in its lifelong or longterm aspect and chapter two deals with salvation in its daily or shortterm aspect
To enjoy Christ may seem to be easy, but without the real enjoyment of Christ, we all would be dissenting, not thinking the same thing
Because our fallen nature is full of dissension, it is difficult to see real harmony not only in our family life but also in the church life
Paul first touched the negative problem of dissension between two of his fellow workers, exhorting them to think the same thing
It is reasonableness, considerateness, and consideration in dealing with others, without strictness of legal right
The Chinese translation of Philippians uses a word for forbearance which means to fit in with another's situation
When another brother or sister comes in who lacks forbearance, trouble may be stirred up, destroying the peaceful situation
Although every verse of Philippians 4 mentions a new item concerning the experience of Christ, all of these items are related to one another
We are vessels made to contain God for His expression, so we have the outward form of these attributes but not their reality
When we live Christ, who is the embodiment of God with all the attributes of God, He fills up all of our empty virtues
We should not only be spiritual and heavenly but also be true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of
To be filled means to be rich with more than enough to eat and to hunger means to be poor to lack to suffer privation with not enough to eat
The book of Philippians ends with a life not dissenting with others, full of forbearance, without anxiety, and full of human virtues
Such a person is full of human virtues with the divine attributes as their contents to express Christ in a human way
Philippians 1 speaks of salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ , living Christ , and magnifying Christ
Forbearance is reasonableness, considerateness, and consideration in dealing with others, without strictness of legal right
All the items spoken of in Philippians 1 through 3 are the elements of the proper human living in chapter four
To live Christ in chapter one is to live a life that is true, honorable, right, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of, full of virtues and praise
As luminaries reflecting Christ in chapter two, our expression is a life that is pure, right, honorable, and true
When we live Christ, we have the reality of all the human virtues, including truthfulness, honor, righteousness, and purity
A proper person is full of virtues, and Christ as the embodiment of God is the content, the reality, of his virtues
In chapter four, there is the life that is true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, well-spoken of, and full of virtue and praise
Their names are in the book of life, and they labored with Paul and Clement , but in their practical life there was a big problem
In the same way, we may speak of spiritual things, but our person may not be true, honorable, righteous, pure, and lovely
In the same way, if we do not make our bed after rising in the morning, it is not likely that we can study the Bible very well
If some would go to China to teach them of Christ as the divine love filling our love, the Chinese scholars could be subdued
Christ as our motivating power may be compared to an electric motor empowering the development of our human virtues
In Philippians 1 the motivator is the Spirit of Jesus Christ who is the bountiful, all-inclusive, all-capable, and all-sufficient supply
Christ passed through incarnation, death, resurrection, ascension, and enthronement by the all-inclusive Spirit
In chapter two the motivator is the inner-operating God , the processed Triune God embodied in Christ who became a life-giving Spirit
The Spirit of Jesus Christ, the inner-operating God, and the power of His resurrection refer to the same person
The very Christ whom we live and magnify in Philippians 1 should be our virtues in our daily life in Philippians 4
Early in the morning, regardless of how busy we are, we must have at least some time to stay in the presence of the Lord
In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God'
Philippians 4:6 is apparently a very simple verse since it exhorts us not to worry and to let God know our requests
On the one hand, as you receive this divine electricity, the old man dies, but on the other hand, the new man lives
Our anxiety can be turned into forbearance by bringing every need, every request, to God and by conversing with Him
When you are full of forbearance, it will be difficult for you to lose your temper or to condemn or criticize others
If you are a person full of forbearance, whether the tea is hot, cold, or lukewarm, you will not express anything
The church is always wonderful according to its nature, but sometimes according to its condition, it may not be so wonderful
If, however, we move and act only according to our own likes and dislikes, we do not have a life of forbearance
When we have learned the lessons in the divine life, we can easily be with another person in their situation without any complaints
Many times, for example, the wife cannot sit in the car while her husband is driving without complaining about his driving
With God in His divinity, it is a matter of His glory, but with us in our humanity, it is a matter of honor or dignity
When Christ ascended to the heavens, He was crowned with both glory and honor because He is a person who is both divine and human
The first six items are categorized as 'whatever is'; the last two, virtue and praise, are categorized as 'if any'
The way to live a life which is full of virtues expressing God and bringing glory and praise to God is in Christ, the One who empowers us
When we love and honor our parents, our love and honor must be different from the human honor taught by the Chinese ethical scholars
Regardless of how high the Chinese ethical teaching of honor may be, it still does not have anything divine in it
They may love others by donating their wealth to hospitals or schools, but there is no flavor of God in their giving
A brother who does not have much money may show his love by giving a needy saint most of his savings without anyone's knowledge
Let us' indicates that there was a conversation among the divine Trinity-the Father, Son, and Spirit-concerning the creation of man
God being Spirit refers to His nature, and God being love, light, holiness, and righteousness refers to His image
In the Old Testament, the Ten Commandments are a portrait of what God is, a portrait of the One who gave the law
Human beings, whether Christians or non-Christians, have the character of love, light, holiness, and righteousness
Though at times we win the battle, often we are not strong enough in our fallen nature to stand against the negative elements
Not only so, but we also are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation'
If the trials that we undergo seem to last a long time, this may indicate that we are not enjoying our moment by moment salvation
You can take away many things from a baby without disturbing him, but you cannot take away the presence of his mother
It is through the death of God's Son that we are reconciled to God, but it is in His life that we are saved daily
We are now boasting, exulting, and glorying, not in the death of Christ or even in His life but in the person of the Triune God
For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection'
Our salvation in our daily life is a walk in newness of life, and to walk in newness of life is to live a life in resurrection
When the Lord Jesus resurrected from the tomb, He left behind the linen cloths and the handkerchief that bound Him
When He resurrected, He left the old creation in His tomb, and He became the firstfruit, the germination, of God's new creation
There is the historical side of the story, which consists of the facts, and there is also the experiential side, the side of our daily life
If we have the adequate experience of the Lord every day, we will remain the same when the environment changes
In previous messages we have considered Romans 6 and 8 and the entire book of Philippians in regard to the experience and growth in life
The 'present day' refers to the time of Paul's writing his Epistle to the Corinthians when Paul was carrying out the New Testament ministry
Apparently the Jewish rabbis and the Jewish seeking ones love God, but their love of God is according to their traditions
In 2 Corinthians 3:15-16 Paul says, 'A veil lies on their heart; but whenever it turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away'
In the Old Testament, the Lord as the Spirit was not there because the Triune God had not yet passed through any processes
In the Old Testament, before the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, the Triune God remained the 'raw' God
In resurrection the Lord as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, not only with divinity but also with humanity
The first Adam was only a created man, but the last Adam is God incarnate, the very God with His humanity who became a life-giving Spirit
Sonizing is a transformation, a transfer, in which the Lord as a person with divinity and humanity became the Spirit
The greatest history among all the histories is the history of God becoming a man and being transferred and transformed to be the Spirit
The New Testament is often taught as history according to the Old Testament ministry in letter without any real light
The New Testament in one person's hand may be one kind of book, but in another person's hand it may be a completely different book
The book of Acts in the hands of some in Christianity has been made to be something of the Old Testament in letter
When the book of Acts is taught according to the New Testament ministry, Christ is ministered into you with light, life, and grace
The goal of my ministry is to help you to be transferred out of the teachings of the letter into the teachings of the Spirit
Though we read the New Testament, most of the time our being may be in the Old Testament age and under the Old Testament ministry
When we turn our heart to the Lord, the veil is taken away, we see the Lord clearly, and we are attracted to Him
We as the mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord are being transformed into the image of the Lord
The way the divine element is constantly added into us is by our beholding and reflecting the Lord with an unveiled face
Following morning watch, throughout the day we still need to behold and reflect the Lord who is the life-giving Spirit
The ministers of the new covenant were captives in a triumphant procession for the celebration of Christ's victory
From the day that Paul, as Saul of Tarsus, was defeated and captured by Christ, he was a captive under Christ's power and authority
Today in America, everyone treasures their liberty, freedom, and human rights, and no one wants to be considered a captive
As captives, the ministers of the new covenant are also the incense-bearers to scatter the fragrance of Christ as the conquering general
We see the all-inclusive, mysterious Christ, who is the mystery of God and who produces the mystery of Christ, the church
Paul, however, unveils to us the mystery of the all-inclusive Christ as the Head for the producing of the Body
The church as the Body of Christ is presented only by Paul, not by Peter, John, or any of the other writers of the New Testament
When we read Paul's Epistles, we are reading him, yet what we see is not Paul himself but Christ as his constituent
Verse 7 says, 'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
The content of this treasure is divinity mingled with humanity, constituted with His wonderful, all-inclusive death and resurrection
Being afflicted in every way indicates the all-inclusive death of Christ, but not being straitened is resurrection
Being persecuted and cast down again indicate death, but not being forsaken and not being destroyed refer to resurrection
Verses 1012 say Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body
For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh
Earthen vessels containing a treasure is the last metaphor used to describe the ministers of the new covenant and their ministry
Verse 16 says, 'Wherefore we do not lose heart, but if indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day'
We are also letters of Christ written by the Spirit, not to display ourselves, but to display ourselves with Christ
How much of this treasure we have in us is indicated by how much we express Christ in His all-inclusive death and resurrection
Question: Being afflicted, perplexed, persecuted, and cast down and the decaying of our outward man are all aspects of the death in Adam
Answer: The death that takes place in Adam is ugly, but the same death, when it takes place in Christ, is lovely
Philippians 3:10 says, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
Every day we are afflicted, perplexed, cast down, and persecuted, and our outward man is decaying, being consumed
In the past several weeks, we have seen the experience and growth in life in the books of Romans, Philippians, and 2 Corinthians
Some of the crucial factors and elements for our experience and growth in life are mentioned in Philippians 2:12-14
While the Lord Jesus lived on this earth, He never murmured, because He lived a crucified life, a life which was always under the cross
Brother Nee once said that no one can commit suicide by crucifixion because crucifixion requires another person to be involved
In married life, if one is not careful concerning murmurings and reasonings, the issue may be separation and divorce
The Apostle Paul aspired to know three crucial factors: Christ, the power of His resurrection, and conformity to the death of Christ
In the same way, Christ with His death and resurrection should not be a philosophy to us, but something living and experiential
In Philippians 3 Paul sought to know Christ as a living Person, to participate in His sufferings, and to be conformed to His death
On the cross, not only was Christ crucified there, but also all the existing things in the universe were crucified with Him
Christ is an all-inclusive Person, so His resurrection, based upon His all-inclusive death, is also all-inclusive
The problem is that often our speaking is weak and the hearing is also weak; therefore, the believing and seeing become very weak
As we are walking down a certain street, we are able to see the things on that street because we are in the position to see them
As we continue to attend the meetings and hear the speaking, gradually we begin to see something month after month and year after year
Many teachers and students of the Bible throughout church history have tried to determine when Peter was saved
At one moment he was casting a net for fish, and the next moment, having been called by the Lord Jesus, he began to follow the Lord
After perhaps three years of following the Lord, Peter and the other disciples were led by the Lord to Caesarea Philippi
On the day of Christ's resurrection, the angel specifically mentioned that Peter should be told about the Lord's resurrection
It seems that Peter might have been regenerated when he made the declaration in Matthew 16:16 that Jesus is the Son of the living God
On the other hand, we often think that we have seen something, when in reality we have seen and experienced very little
As the Lord was going to Jerusalem to be crucified, the disciples also argued among themselves as to which one of them would be the greatest
It seems that after three and a half years the disciples saw very little and that the time the Lord spent with them was wasted
The more time we spend with the Lord, the more we learn, and the more a treasure is accumulated within our being
Such a routine includes morning watch every morning, walking by the Spirit each day, and attending the meetings regularly
Will there be a time in our ministry to others when we sense that the Lord has a clear way through us without any flavor of ourselves?
What we have covered in this series of messages entitled The Experience and Growth in Life is the extract of the entire New Testament
Some people have obtained doctoral degrees in the study of the Bible, but they may have seen only the substance
They can tell you what is taught in the four Gospels, in the Acts, in the Epistles of Paul, James, Peter, John, and Jude, and in Revelation
They have seen the substance of the New Testament, but very few Bible readers have seen the essence within the New Testament

The same child placed in a family of another nationality will resemble a person of that nationality when he grows up
Our dealings with sins sin the world and the conscience are superficial dealings but our dealing with the disposition is the deepest dealing
To deal with sins and sin is relatively easy, but to deal with our disposition and character is very difficult
Our character is more troublesome than our disposition because our character is composed of our disposition plus our habits
To deal only with our habits is not sufficient because our habits are only the outward expression of our character
In the Gospels, from the time the Lord first called Peter, the Lord took every opportunity to deal with Peter's character and disposition
Even in eternity we will continue to live with the divine element added to, grafted to, and mingled with our being
In eternity we will see and recognize all the brothers and sisters, but they will be much newer and much more living
A transformed person will not remain in his old disposition, and a renewed person will not remain in his old character or expression
Question: Is dealing with our disposition and character different from being changed by the divine dispensing?

Although the word disposition is not mentioned here, it can be seen in the elements of opinion, the self, the soul-life, and Satan
In marriage life the sin of ambition does not arise every day, but the problem of opinion may arise many times each day
In the Lord's work, in the church life, and in the spiritual life, the greatest damaging factor is our opinion
Since the Lord's recovery came to this country over twenty-five years ago, we have had only two major 'storms'
Opinion is the expression of our disposition, and our disposition is the greatest problem for our growth in the divine life
After the turmoil passed, one of the first messages he gave was on the breaking of the outer man and the release of the spirit
When three gospel team members come together, if one would say something to maintain the one accord, he may offend the other two
If we argue and correct others, we will set up a model of arguing and correcting, and the others will also argue
Question: When some come together to fellowship, they are passive because they do not want to express their opinion
If we each go our own way and take care of our own portion without fellowship, it will be hard for us to enjoy the Lord's presence
When we come together with others, we must deny ourselves, have no opinion, and go along with whatever the others propose
When the members of a gospel team come together and no one has an opinion, this is the best time for the Lord to do something
The accuracy of our feelings depends on the breaking of our outer man through the cross and on how much we die to ourselves
Answer: To practice the new way to meet and serve, we must first go out to knock on doors to get people saved and baptized

When you live according to your disposition and are corrected by others, your character is expressed in the way you change your behavior
One of the boys may have the ball, dribbling it very slowly, and a friend may rebuke him for being so slow, asking him to pass the ball
When the first boy passes the ball, he may do it in an excessively fast and rough manner, reacting to the rebuke of the other boy
In the same way, when we deny the self and lose the soul-life , the disposition is dealt with, because it is implied in these things
From morning to evening, throughout the entire day, we must remember that we are people who have already been crucified

The thing which most damages our usefulness in the Christian life and church life is our living according to our disposition

Throughout church history there have been many very capable brothers such as Peter Paul Martin Luther John Nelson Darby and Watchman Nee
Someone may have the ambition to be the president of a country, but not have the capacity to hold such an office
On the other hand, a person may be very capable, but if he has ambition, his ambition will destroy his capacity, his usefulness
If a country is going to be a strong country, it must produce a number of capable persons, who have a large capacity
Throughout history, the persons who have damaged entire countries the most have been people who were very capable but who were too ambitious
In the church in Shanghai, another brother who was also very capable was Brother Yu, who was an eye specialist
In the church life, some are very capable and ambitious, and others are not very capable, but they also are ambitious
Once ambition is killed in the church life, the usefulness of everyone, including those of limited capacity, will come out
If all the saints, especially those who are being trained to serve the Lord full-time, kill their disposition, everything will be very good
How useful you will be to the Lord or how much trouble you will make to the church depends upon how much your disposition is killed
On the other hand, according to our disposition, we may be persons who rarely say something to express ourselves
According to my observation over many years, the real enemy of our growth in the divine life is our disposition

The Christians who do not have any peculiarity, any peculiar traits, are the ones who grow the most and the fastest
If we would diagnose these cases of rebellion, we could see that the source of the rebellion was the disposition of the persons involved
Many other dear saints, however, have not rebelled, but they were more useful in former years than they are today

The real problem between husbands and wives is the particular and peculiar part of their makeup, their disposition
If Peter had been still living in his disposition, he would not have made such a strong commendation of the one who rebuked him
It is impossible for us to break through the problem of our disposition, but it is possible for the Lord to do it
If we deal with the 'burl,' we will grow quickly and have a free way in our spiritual life without any hindrances to our growth in life

In 1 Corinthians 7, the person who was Saul of Tarsus with the strong disposition had been dealt with, but the regenerated Paul remained

Through the sifting process, Saul became Paul, a person who had been uplifted and purified with a high standard of humanity

In other words, the queen of England left her place in England to visit the civilian place of Hong Kong, but she did not become a civilian
The one intrinsic matter on the negative side related to the church is the intrinsic factor of the winds of teaching
If we do not know the intrinsic essence, intrinsic growth, intrinsic building up, and intrinsic fellowship of the church, we can be sifted
You must ask whether or not the messages given by certain opposing ones have strengthened the saints' faith and their growth in life
The winds of teaching cause your faith to be weakened and raise doubts about the church life and the Lord's recovery
Although many saints remain positive, these doubts and suspicions within them have become a factor which weakens and even shakes their faith
Among a group of five saints who formed the crucial center of the church, there was never any kind of dissension, opinion, or ambition
Again, this is the way we practiced the church life; everyone stayed within his own limit, and everyone knew where he was

According to Matthew 13 in some cases the seed can hardly grow because many things in our heart leave no room for it to grow
The Lord tells us that the thorns are the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches that choke the word
Because of the occupying things in our heart, the seed of life within us does not have the room; it does not have the possibility to grow
God saves, rescues, separates us from the world, and gathers us together so that He can speak, but He cannot speak by Himself
Because not many of the Lord's children will speak, some professionals are trained to speak for the congregation
Surely God does not like this, so we are trying our best to put this practice aside and give God the opportunity to speak
The principle of letting God grow is not only in speaking in the meetings but also in all things in our daily life
The phrase 'for the rest' indicates that, though Paul has already written nearly four chapters, he still has more to say

At the end of Philippians 4:8, Paul concludes with two items that sum up the points mentioned in the earlier part of the verse
If you are a person with all of these eight items, you are a person with good character, a person with excellent characteristics
Character is constituted with thirty percent nature by birth and seventy percent habit formed by the daily life
The slowness you received by birth would be joined to a habit of slowness to form a character with this terrible characteristic

If you practice to be accurate, when you read the Bible, you will read it accurately, because this is your habit
If by practice you have been built up as a strict and accurate person, you will pay attention to each word of the Bible
When we say that we must endeavor to do things, this does not mean that we do things with our own effort like Olympic athletes
We do have an attitude and we also hold such a spirit that we are looking unto Him, trusting Him to do things for us
When we are such persons, our colleagues or co-workers who are with us daily and weekly will notice that we are people who trust in the Lord
Because many Christians have not seen the principle of incarnation, there have been many debates concerning the nature of the Christian life
The word of Jehovah came objectively upon the speakers, and they declared that it was not their word but the Lord's

Certain persons used to gamble before they were saved, but after being saved, they were no longer able to gamble
We did not realize that it was not merely we who acted, but the processed and dispensing God, who is Christ consummated as the Spirit
The very God lives together with man, the sinful and dirtied man who has been chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and saved
Because of our Partner, we are here in the church and have dropped many things to concentrate ourselves on the Christian life
The unbelievers do not have such a One with them in their experience; therefore, they do not understand this kind of language
As you are in your daily activities, you should realize that another invisible One is with you and indwelling you
Sometimes, we do not like the fact that He is dwelling within us because we are not able to do or say things so freely
Without remembering that the Lord is within us, we may be free to like or dislike anyone according to our own choice
Quite often, the husband is frustrated from doing what he likes by his wife, and the wife is also frustrated by the husband
Before marriage, he had no such restrictions or frustrations, but after marriage, he has a lot of restrictions
Because our entire being was contaminated, we need the blood of Jesus Christ to continually and constantly cleanse us from all sin

If we are seeking after the growth in the divine life and seeking to live the Christian life, we should always remember who our Savior is
The knowledge of Christ that many Christians have is too limited, shallow, traditional, and even superstitious
Many hold an inadequate concept of Christ in the divine Trinity and do not realize how Christ's person is related to God's economy

We will bear the responsibility to dispense Him to others, not only to sinners, but also to weaker, younger Christians
