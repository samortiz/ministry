   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some say that the man-child refers to the whole church, but this cannot be true either, because:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 The whole church cannot be resurrected, for this would mean that the whole church has died.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2 The whole church is not raptured at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some go first, and some go later; but here all of the man-child is raptured at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 The promise of shepherding all nations with an iron rod is not given to the whole church but to the overcomers 2:26-27 , and not all in the church are overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>4 The matter of reigning is not for the whole church since only those who suffer together with the Lord may reign together with Him 2 Tim 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Who then is the man-child?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He refers to the overcoming Christians who have died.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1 He must include some of those in the church in Smyrna, those who were faithful unto death Rev 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This matches 12:11, which says, "even unto death."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2 He includes some of those in the church in Thyatira, those who will shepherd all nations with an iron rod 2:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This matches 12:5, which says, "To shepherd all the nations with an iron rod."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3 He includes some of those in the church in Philadelphia, those who will be saved from and not subjected to the tribulation 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This matches 12:5, which says that the man-child is "caught up to God."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>4 He also includes some of those in the church in Laodicea, those who will sit on the throne 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This matches 12:5, which says that the man-child will "shepherd all the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the man-child is neither the whole church nor a part of those in various local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are the overcomers in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are the Christians who were martyred and resurrected, because: 1 Revelation 12:11 expressly says that they loved not their soul-life even unto death, and 2 "brought forth" here symbolizes resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In covering Revelation 7:16-17 we have already mentioned eight points that match what is recorded here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The man-child is a major part of the great multitude that no man can number.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Chapter seven speaks in a general way, revealing an outline of the rapture, whereas chapter twelve speaks in detail about a portion of the raptured ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matthew 25:1 through 13 is a parable concerning the ten virgins, hence; the word "slept" cannot be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, we cannot say that it means unwatchfulness, because the five wise virgins also slept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, sleep indicates death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The five wise virgins are the man-child in Revelation 12:5, and the five foolish virgins are a part which includes the remnant of the woman's seed in Revelation 12:17 there are survivors among this part .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Revelation 12:5 says that this group of Christians has died, resurrected, and been raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>F. Revelation 12:6</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place there prepared by God so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fleeing of the woman is the flight that is described in Matthew 24:6-20 and Luke 21:20-24.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Revelation 12:1 the woman is in heaven; in 12:6 she is in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Immediately after the man-child is born, she loses her position in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She is now just the earthly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The wilderness means a desolate and uninhabited place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God nourishes her at this time in the same way that He once nourished the children of Israel in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Galatians 4:21-31 there are two contrasts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first is between the Jerusalem in heaven and the Jerusalem on earth; the one signifies the Christians, and the other, the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One is represented by Isaac, and the other, by Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The main thought, however, is to prove that we Christians are free in the same way that Isaac was free.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>WAR IN HEAVEN</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>REVELATION 12:7-9 A. Revelation 12:7</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And the dragon warred and his angels."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The war determines who is to live in the heavens the man-child or the dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The man-child now wants to obtain the position of the dragon; hence, he must go to war.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the whole Bible there is only one archangel Michael.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The meaning of this name is "the one who is very much like God" some say that Michael is the Lord Jesus .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During the time of Job, the dragon could come before the presence of God Job 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He could also do this during the Lord's time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But after the man-child is caught up, he can no longer do this.</S>
