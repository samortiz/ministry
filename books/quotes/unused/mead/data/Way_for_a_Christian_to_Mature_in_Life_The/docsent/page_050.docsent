   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HEART OF A MAN REPRESENTING HIS PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here we would like to elaborate on a particular matter our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The spirit of man is the deepest and most central part of his whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man s soul is his outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The soul includes the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man s heart also includes many things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man s heart has thoughts, desires, and intentions Heb 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, our heart includes our mind, emotion, and will the three parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, our mind, emotion, and will are all a matter of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hebrews 10:22 also reveals that our conscience is in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The heart includes the conscience, and the conscience is part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The spirit also has three parts intuition, fellowship, and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In summary, the heart is the mind, emotion, and will plus the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The conscience is in our spirit, our deepest part, and surrounding our conscience is our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, our heart has four parts first, the conscience; second, the mind; third, the emotion; and fourth, the will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among these four parts conscience, mind, emotion, and will one part is in the spirit and three parts are in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the heart is connected to the spirit as well as to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, the heart is where our spirit and our soul converge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The heart is the converging place of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the heart represents a person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we believe that a person is bad, we often say that his heart is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In addition, when the heart is absent, the person is absent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes, a person is present, but his heart is absent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In such a case, the person might as well be absent since only the heart can represent a person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE HEART BEING THE GATEWAY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who study the Bible all agree that God s Spirit and God s life being in our spirit means that they are in the intuition and fellowship of our spirit, our most central part.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the spirit of man not only has the intuition and the fellowship; it also has the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, God s Spirit and life, which are in our spirit, also touch our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When God s Spirit and life spread from our spirit, they go through our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, our heart is the key, the gateway.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether God s Spirit and life within us can spread to our mind, emotion, and will depends upon whether our heart allows God to pass through it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a person is saved, God enters into him and becomes one with him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before a person is saved, he lives in his mind, emotion, will, and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is where he is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once he is saved, God enters into him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Which part of him is God in?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, there is something between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This something is the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, everything depends upon whether our heart is turned to the Lord or away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When our heart is turned away from the Lord, then we are turned away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When our heart is turned to the Lord, we are turned to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Second Corinthians 3:16 says, But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why is it that whenever the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is removed?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The reason is that man s turned away heart is the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a person has his back toward us, he cannot see us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That is the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the heart is turned to the Lord, man is face to face with the Lord, and naturally, the veil is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even though many of us are saved and have the Lord in our spirit, our heart often separates us from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In a sense, the Lord is on the inside, we are on the outside, and the heart is between us, so that we and the Lord cannot be face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, everything depends upon where our heart is facing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When our heart is toward the Lord, there are no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We and the Lord are face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But when our heart is turned away from the Lord, then we are turned away from the Lord, and spontaneously, there is no communication with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So, the heart is an important gateway.</S>
