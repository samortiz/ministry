There are approximately twenty young brothers and sisters who are all engineering and agricultural graduates of Northwest University. They all have the heart and desire to serve the Lord. May the Lord gain them.</p><p>In retrospect, I did not learn many things well last year before the Lord. Nor was I able to read the Bible as often as I had planned. My mind is still too active. However, my feelings toward the Body and toward authority seem to have gradually become weightier. I have personally experienced some of the things I saw in the Word. May the Lord allow me to touch something of resurrection again in my experience and to leave all vain matters behind. I hope you would also remember my poor, weak, blind, and pitiful condition and instruct me much.</p><p>Lee Yin-hsin<br />January 2, 1950</p><p>The brothers in Lanchow, Pinching, and Tienshui were all blessed by the Lord in the gospel after the new year. The Lord willing, we will go to Meixian (more than three hundred miles west of Changan) to preach the gospel the day after tomorrow.</p><p>Lee Yin-xin<br />February 10, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 23 Garden Road, Lanchow, Kansu province</p><h2 class="head2">The Desperate Need for "Edification" (Lanchow)</h2><p>The gospel conference over Chinese New Year lasted for seven days with ten meetings. Eighty-three people registered to be baptized. Apart from those who needed more time or did not have the time, we actually baptized thirty-seven (one was an aborigine). There is another aborigine who is ready but has not yet been baptized. On the fourteenth through the sixteenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, we arranged for three more days of gospel preaching and increased our visits to those friends who had not yet been baptized. As a result, eighteen more registered to be baptized. We have preached the gospel four times since January 1 and saved a total of ninety-two people: fifty-nine brothers and thirty-three sisters. We now feel that God has especially blessed us in the matter of the gospel. Thank Him. However, now we need "edification." Although we have increased our visitation, we still feel that we are not giving them enough guidance. Furthermore, the young brothers and sisters have started school, so "edification" is our desperate need.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Lee Jing-san<br />Ku Zhong-yin<br />Tu Xin-xue</p><p>Mailing Address: 3 Garden Road, Shuang Cheng Men Wai, Lanchow</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_079.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_081.html">Next</a> </body></html>
