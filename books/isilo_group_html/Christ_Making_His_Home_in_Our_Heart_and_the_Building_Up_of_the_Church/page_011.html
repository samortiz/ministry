<h1 class="title">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME<br />
AND THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>When some Christians experience an adverse situation or encounter difficulty, other people cannot tell that they are in any kind of turmoil. This does not mean that these Christians do not have any feeling but that they do not express their feeling. I received much help from a brother who knew the Lord. He once said that he did not react in a situation, because the Lord had not reacted within him. His inward situation could not be shaken by outward factors.</p>
<p>We have also seen some Christians who love the Lord, are living, and are often joyful but who are unable to handle any difficulty. When they encounter difficulty, they panic and burst into tears. There was a sister who, after hearing the inaccurate news that her child might have been involved in a car accident, immediately became hysterical. Those who were with her tried to comfort her, saying that she should not panic, because the news may not be accurate, and her child may not have been in that car. They also said that she needed to find out what happened. However, she would not calm down but continued to cry. While she was crying, her child returned. When she saw her child, she could not calm herself down. She held her child tightly and jumped continually for joy.</p>
<p>Some may say that this was a normal human reaction. However, even though a person who allows the Lord to make home in his heart is full of feeling, he is calm in any circumstance he encounters. Even when he is so sad that he is in tears, he is still calm. No matter what kind of pain or joy he experiences, he is calm and secure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO ALLOW THE LORD<br />
TO MAKE HOME IN THEM BEING CALM AND SECURE</h2>
<p>When the Lord is making His home in our heart, joy and sorrow cannot govern our reactions. A person in whom the Lord is making His home will be calm when giving a message and calm when imprisoned. He is calm whether he is joyful or sorrowful. On the day of Pentecost, Peter spoke in front of a large crowd, yet he was secure (Acts 2:14-41). When Peter was brought before the magistrate, he did not panic when he spoke, and when he was locked up in prison, he was also secure (4:1-20). Peter was calm and secure because the Lord, who is calm and secure, had made His home in Peter. Not only did Peter have the Lord within him and not only did he have the Lord&rsquo;s appearing, but even more the Lord was making His home in Peter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO ALLOW THE LORD<br />
TO MAKE HOME IN THEM<br />
GIVING THE LORD COMPLETE LORDSHIP</h2>
<p>In order for a person to make home in a house, he must be given the legal right of possession to the house. Then he can completely settle down in the house. If you ask me where the loveliest place in the whole world is, I would say that the loveliest place is my home. Last year I visited several places, but it was only when I returned home that I felt truly at rest, because not only is my body in my home, but my heart is also in my home. Every part of me is in my home. The Lord wants to be life in us to the extent that all that He is can be secure in us. He wants to be life in us to the extent that we become a place where He can dwell securely because He can put everything, including His intention, His way, His work, and His everything, in us.</p>
<p>The Lord gradually becomes our life until He can make us His dwelling place by making His home in our heart. This is what the apostle Paul prayed for in Ephesians 3. He bowed his knees to the Father for this cause, praying that God would cause Christ to make His home in the hearts of the saints through faith (vv. 14, 17). Paul was clear that Christ was in the saints and that they had the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. However, Paul also knew that Christ desired to make His home in the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST NEEDING TO MAKE<br />
HIS HOME IN THE SAINTS<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Since the church is the dwelling place of God, the building up of the church will be frustrated if Christ cannot make home in the saints. The church can be manifested and built up only when Christ has made His home in a group of saints. Such saints are not merely saved to have the Lord in them. Neither do these saints merely have the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. They also allow Christ to be their life until Christ occupies every corner of their heart, and they become His dwelling place. When there is such a group of saints, the church is manifested practically and can be built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MANIFESTATIONS OF<br />
CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN US</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Restful in Circumstances</h2>
<p>Several situations manifest that the Lord is making His home in us. The first situation is that we are at rest within. This rest is not limited to certain matters, nor is it manifested only when everything is peaceful. On the contrary, we are at rest within no matter what the time or the circumstance is. We can be at rest because Christ is making His home in us. A lack of joy proves that the Lord needs to make His home in us. The continual absence of peace proves that the Lord needs to make His home in us. We should ask ourselves whether we have peace within and are at rest. If we are at rest and cannot be disturbed, having a calmness that cannot be shaken, the Lord is making His home in us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ Making His Home in Our Heart and the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
