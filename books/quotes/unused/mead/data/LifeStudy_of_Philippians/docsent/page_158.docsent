   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE TO OBTAIN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY ATTAINING TO THE OUT-RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: Phil 3:10-14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 3:10-14 Paul emphasizes the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 11 says, If by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul s endeavor was to attain to this outstanding resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 12 he goes on to say, Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here Paul admits that he had not yet attained the out-resurrection, but he continued to pursue that he may lay hold of it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this out-resurrection, Christ had laid hold of him, and now Paul s desire was to lay hold of the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The purpose of Christ in laying hold of him was that he might obtain the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, in verses 11 and 12 the out-resurrection is Paul s goal, the object of his pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verses 13 and 14 Paul continues, Brothers, I do not yet reckon myself to have laid hold, but one thing forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here we see that Paul did not reckon himself to have laid hold of the out-resurrection already.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, he pursued toward the goal, the goal of the out-resurrection, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE GOAL AND THE PRIZE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a difference between the goal and the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul pursued toward the goal for the prize of God s high calling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every calling has a purpose with a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What are the purpose and goal of God s high calling?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The expression high calling used here does not mean that the calling is high; it means that this calling is from above, that is, from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Literally translated, the Greek means the above calling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Hebrews 3:1 Paul uses the term heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The out-resurrection is both the purpose and the goal of God s heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, if we consider 3:10-14 carefully, we shall realize that the out-resurrection is Paul s subject.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The term out-resurrection is found in the Bible only in 3:11.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to my knowledge, most translations ignore the Greek prefix ek, which means out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here Paul adds this prefix to the usual Greek word for resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What was his reason for doing this?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to his vision and experience, Paul realized that God s intention in the universe is altogether related to something which is new, something in resurrection, but resurrection in a very particular sense, not resurrection in an ordinary sense.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>OUT OF THE OLD CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AND INTO THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The common meaning of resurrection is that something dies and comes to life again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lazarus was resurrected in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He had died, had been buried, and had even begun to smell bad.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then the Lord Jesus came and cried out, Lazarus, come forth! and Lazarus came out of the tomb John 11:43-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Was the resurrection of Lazarus a case of the out-resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No. Even though Lazarus was raised from the dead and came to life again, nothing of the new creation was wrought into him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, he continued to be a person in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At most, Lazarus experienced restoration; he was restored from death to the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But he was neither regenerated at that time nor did he receive a new constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Have you ever heard a message telling you that the resurrection of Lazarus was still in the realm of the old creation and that Lazarus was not resurrected into the new creation?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The fact that Lazarus was not brought into the new creation through resurrection is proved in that one day he died again and his once-resurrected body was laid once more in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The out-resurrection in 3:11 is very different from the resurrection of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Did Paul expect to return to the tomb once he obtained the out-resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The resurrection Paul was pursuing in Philippians 3 was something absolutely apart from the old creation and in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What Paul terms the out-resurrection refers to a resurrection out of the old creation and into the new creation.</S>
