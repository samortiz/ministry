He was invited to the wedding feast because he was a real Christian. But at the wedding feast this man was approached by the king, who said to him, "Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?" (v. 12). Because he did not have a wedding garment, that man was cast out into the outer darkness (v. 13). This shows that merely to have Christ as our objective righteousness is not sufficient for us to be qualified to enter into the enjoyment of the kingdom of the heavens, to enter into the wedding feast with the Lamb. What we need is the detailed embroidery work of the Holy Spirit by living Christ out as our subjective righteousness (Phil. 3:9).</P><P>Each day when we cooperate with the Lord, saying Amen to the Spirit's moving inside of us, we experience the Spirit's embroidering of Christ into us stitch after stitch. This garment qualifies us to be the overcomers who feast with the Lord at the wedding feast of the Lamb. This aggregate of overcomers is the bride of the Lamb, the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>Eventually, this bride will be the army with Christ to defeat and destroy Antichrist and his army at Armageddon (Rev. 17:14; 19:14, 19-21; 16:14, 16). Christ today is looking for the overcomers not only to be His lovers but also to be His fighters in His army. Today for us to be the testimony of Jesus we need to become fighters because Jesus is a victorious fighter. He is the One today who is fighting for God's interest and purpose on this earth. As His testimony we stand with Him and fight with Him for God's purpose. Today we are a corporate fighter, fighting for God's expression on this earth. If we are going to be fighters, we must be vital. Fighters cannot be dead, old, or lukewarm. They must be living, active, absolute, and desperate to fight for the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>On the last day of the great tribulation, Antichrist and his armies will be gathered at Armageddon. Then the bridegroom, Christ, who has become the victorious general, will come with the overcoming saints as His army to defeat and destroy Antichrist and his army. This closes all the wars in this age. Christ will be the ultimate victorious general. Antichrist and the false prophet will be thrown into the lake of fire, and Satan will be bound and thrown into the abyss. The rebellious armies of Antichrist will be utterly destroyed, and God's kingdom will come to the earth. Then the aggregate of the overcomers as the bride will enjoy Christ as the bridegroom for a thousand years and reign with Christ as His co-kings in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_065.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_067.html">Next</a> </body></html>
