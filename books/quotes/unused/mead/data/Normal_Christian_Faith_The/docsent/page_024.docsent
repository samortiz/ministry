   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GREATER THAN ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Jews were confused.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They were totally bewildered.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who was this man?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ancestor of the Jews is Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They boasted of being the descendants of Abraham in the same way the Chinese boast of being the offspring of Hwang-ti.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The name Abraham was highly venerated among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now they brought out Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please read John 8:53: "Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The prophets died too.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who are You making Yourself?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How did Jesus answer them?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Was He greater or smaller than Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 56 Jesus said, "Your father Abraham exulted that he would see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even Abraham had to look forward to Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, verse 57: "The Jews then said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now please pay your attention to Jesus' answer in verse 58: "Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Tell me who this man is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I told you that before Hwang-ti was, I, Watchman Nee am there, you would immediately write me off as a lunatic.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some of you would say that I am a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The words Jesus spoke made Him either a madman, a liar, or God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There can be no fourth alternative.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>HE IS IN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to read on.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 10:37-38 Jesus said, "If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; but if I do them, even if you do not believe Me, believe the works so that you may come to know and continue to know..."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Know what?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The clause following is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a big statement: "...that the Father is in Me and I am in the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who then is this man?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said that He was in God and God was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Passages like the above are numerous in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I shall mention one more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Read carefully John 14:6-7: "Jesus said to him, I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him." It says clearly that if you know Jesus of Nazareth, you have known the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why is this so?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is because He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>NO NEED TO ASK TO SEE THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One of the disciples was confused.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John 14:8 says, "Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Philip was asking to be shown the Father who had been mentioned again and again by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 9 says, "Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here Jesus made it very plain that to see Him is to see God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He made no apology about it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no need to see the Father anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you see Him, you see God!</S>
