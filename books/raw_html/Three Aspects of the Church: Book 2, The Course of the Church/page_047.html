<h1 class="title">THE HISTORY OF THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE IN CHINA</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">EARLY HISTORY&mdash;BEFORE 1900</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Nestorianism</h2>
<p>Because we were born in China, raised in China, and live in China, we must include the history of Christianity in China in a discussion of our origins. We will begin with the first preaching of Christianity in China.</p>
<p>Based on historical records, the first Christians to come to China were the Nestorians. They came during the Tang Dynasty, between A.D. 600 and A.D. 700. The emperor of the Tang Dynasty ordered his prime minister, Fang Hsuan-ling, to go outside the capital city to welcome these missionaries from Persia. The Nestorian missionaries relied on scholarship to preach the gospel, and their religion spread rapidly among the high government officials, that is, among the intellectuals. With such a strong backing, Nestorianism quickly spread throughout the country. However, because the Nestorians did not lead people to experience Christ as life, Nestorianism died out when the dynasty changed.</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty there was a remnant of the Nestorians in Yenching, which is today&rsquo;s Peking. At one time, a Mongolian became the highest Nestorian bishop in Persia. Thus, even during the Ming Dynasty, Nestorianism had not completely disappeared; there was still a small number of Nestorians in northern China.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Catholicism</h2>
<p>The preaching of Catholicism in China began with the arrival of Matteo Ricci during the Ming Dynasty. Matteo Ricci, a very scholarly man, was a member of the Roman Catholic Society of Jesus. Because he knew much about astronomy and the making of calendars, the Chinese imperial court was very courteous to him. Matteo Ricci edited and improved the Chinese lunar calendar, which is also called the imperial calendar. One of the officials in the Ming Dynasty was named Hsu Kuang-chi, and he became a Roman Catholic. He owned a great deal of land in Shanghai&rsquo;s Hsu Chia Hui district, most of which he later donated to the Roman Catholic Church. At that time, many people converted to Catholicism, but most of them were eunuchs or high officials in the capital city; not many were common people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Protestantism</h2>
<p>Robert Morrison came to China in 1807. He can be considered the first Protestant missionary to come to China. Since China at that time was a closed country and was very strict about not opening to the outside, Morrison sometimes came to do business and sometimes came as a diplomat to the capital city. Later, after China had lost some wars and signed unequal treaties with a number of countries, the door was opened for missionaries to travel inland and freely preach the gospel. The Ching Dynasty was responsible for protecting the missionaries.</p>
<p>Numerous factors, including improvements in transportation, inflation, economic surpluses in Western countries, and the expansion of foreign influence, later made it even more convenient for Western missionaries to come to China. At that time it was easier for a Westerner to enter and leave China than it was for a Chinese; the Westerners did not need entry permits or visas. Westerners came and went freely without the need of any documents. Prior to my salvation, because I did not recognize God&rsquo;s working, I was upset when I saw foreigners on the street. Today I see the spiritual view that this was God&rsquo;s arrangement for the preaching of the gospel in an old, traditional country. If it were not for this way, how could the gospel of Christ have been preached in China?</p>
<p>When the Western missionaries first came to China, they met with difficulty because the Chinese considered all foreigners as enemies. The Treaty of Tientsin between China and England ordained that Penglai, formerly Tengchow Fu, in the Shantung Province would be opened as a port; later, because the water was too shallow to be a good harbor, the port was moved to the commercial harbor at Chefoo. The first Western missionaries to northern China came to Penglai, but it was difficult for them to rent a house. Although the Chinese government allowed foreigners into the country, the populace would not allow them to rent houses, and if foreigners wanted to buy land, no one would sell it to them.</p>
<p>The Chinese people decided that whoever sold land to a foreigner would not be allowed into the ancestral temples or shrines. Thus, no one dared to sell land to foreigners, and this was a big problem to them. Later, the foreigners asked the imperial court of the Ching Dynasty for land, according to the provisions of their treaties. The treaties clearly stated that foreigners could preach the gospel in China and that the imperial court had to protect them. Thus, the imperial court ordered the local officials to gather the landowners together to discuss and solve this problem. As a result, the Presbyterian Church obtained an old Buddhist temple in Penglai, which they remodeled into a chapel for Western missionaries. When I was learning how to serve the Lord, I once preached the gospel in that chapel.</p>
<p>The history of the Lord&rsquo;s move in China includes the Chinese translations of the Bible. During the Nestorian period, Chinese translations of some parts of the Bible already existed. When Matteo Ricci came to China, the Roman Catholics began translating the Bible into Chinese. The present Roman Catholic Chinese translation is a later revision. Robert Morrison was the first Protestant to translate the Bible into Chinese. Much of his translation work was done in Macao, which is close to Canton; Morrison spent some of his time in Canton and some in Macao. Three hundred years ago Macao was a Portuguese colony. Robert Morrison employed various reasons to remain in Macao, but his real task there was the translation of the Bible into Chinese.</p>
<p>The Chinese Union Version that we use today has been revised many times. In 1890 a committee of seven men was formed for the translation of the Bible. The chairman of the committee was Calvin Wilson Mateer, who founded Chilu University in Shantung Province. The seven men on the committee were usually in different places, each translating at his own pace. Every summer they would meet in Chefoo to work together. Because each verse had been translated in many different ways, they would put the different renderings side by side and consider which would be best for the final version. An elderly brother among us, Brother Chu, assisted Mr. Mateer by copying the translation of the Bible. The committee spent a total of twenty-nine years on this translation of the Bible, finishing in 1919. The Chinese Union Version is the best Chinese translation of the Bible.</p>
<p>When Calvin Mateer first came to China, he came to the town in which I was born. One story says that he learned Chinese in an idol temple. This illustrates the fact that when the missionaries first came to China, it was difficult for them to contact the Chinese people. It was not only difficult for them to find places to stay but also to find food to eat. When they went out to buy food, people were not necessarily willing to sell to them. Thus, in the beginning their situation was very difficult. The conservative, closed attitude among the Chinese was especially strong in the northern part of China; it is truly beyond description. But God is really God; He is over all things and controls all situations, causing all things to work together for His gospel. Regardless of how closed and conservative the Chinese were, God still opened the door for the gospel.</p>
