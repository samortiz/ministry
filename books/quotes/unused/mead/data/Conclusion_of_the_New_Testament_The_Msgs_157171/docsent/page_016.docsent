   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>7 To Inherit the Kingdom of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually, if we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and partake in the kingdom, we shall inherit the kingdom of God 1 Cor, 6:9a, 10b; Gal 5:21b; Eph 5:5b .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Inheriting the kingdom of God is different from entering into the kingdom of God through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Having entered into the kingdom by being regenerated, we now need to grow and develop in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then, as a result of this growth and development, we shall inherit the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we should not think that simply because we have entered into the kingdom of God we shall inherit the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot inherit the kingdom unless we grow to maturity in the proper development in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Corinthians 6, Galatians 5, and Ephesians 5 all speak of inheriting the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1 Corinthians 6:9a Paul asks, "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To inherit the kingdom of God in the next age is a reward to the saints who seek righteousness Matt 5:10, 20; 6:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Believers who are not righteous will not inherit the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Lord's word in Matthew, we must be absolutely righteous if we are to inherit the coming kingdom as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord even says that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees Matt 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because God's kingdom is established upon righteousness, we must be righteous in order to inherit it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 Corinthians 6:9b and 10 Paul speaks of different kinds of persons who will not inherit the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once again, Paul does not speak of entering the kingdom of God but of inheriting the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To enter the kingdom of God we simply need a new birth John 3:3, 5 , but to inherit the kingdom of God we need to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens now.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No sinful person or unrighteous person can have any part in the coming kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word "inherit" in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 10 implies enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To inherit a certain thing is to enjoy that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, to inherit the coming kingdom means to enjoy the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The coming kingdom will be a joyful inheritance to the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Matthew, the manifestation of the kingdom will be a reward to the overcoming saints as their enjoyment with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To inherit the kingdom is not simply to enter the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This should be an incentive for us to live an overcoming life, a life that is sinless and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By living a righteous life we shall be qualified to inherit the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The overcomers, the victorious ones, will inherit the kingdom of God when the Lord Jesus comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today the kingdom is not an enjoyment but an exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, when the Lord Jesus comes back, the kingdom will be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time we shall enjoy the kingdom, and we shall be kings ruling with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the kingdom will be our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Galatians 5:21 Paul, referring to the works of the flesh, says, "Those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not related to a believer's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those believers who practice the works of the flesh listed in Galatians 5:19-21 will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Ephesians 5:5 Paul again speaks of those who have "no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The kingdom of Christ is the millennium Rev 20:4, 6; Matt 16:28 and also the kingdom of God Matt 13:41, 43 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God and are, in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not all believers will participate in the millennium; only the overcomers will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The unclean, defeated ones will have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to John 3, all those who are regenerated are in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Romans 14:17 indicates that in the church life we are in the kingdom of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, the millennium will be the kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only in the millennium will the kingdom of Christ also become the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the term "the kingdom of Christ and of God" refers not to the kingdom today in the church life but to the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today all believers are in the kingdom of God, but not all of them will have an inheritance in the coming millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Both the defeated ones and the overcoming ones may be in the church as the kingdom of God, but only the overcoming ones will inherit the kingdom during the millennium.</S>
