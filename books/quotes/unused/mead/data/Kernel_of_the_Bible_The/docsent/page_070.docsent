   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT WITNESSING WITH OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third verse concerning the two spirits is Romans 8:16.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we see that the divine Spirit witnesses with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many times these two spirits talk to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our spirit may say, God is my Father, and the divine Spirit will say, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The divine Spirit may say, You are a child of God, and our spirit will say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all need to become thoroughly familiar with these three verses on the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Remember, in John 3:6 our spirit is born of the Spirit; in John 4:24, our spirit worships the Spirit; and in Romans 8:16, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These three verses are virtually all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 3:6 we are reborn, in John 4:24 we digest God and enjoy Him, and in Romans 8:16 we walk with God, live by God, and are one with God in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the Christian life, the Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We live by the divine Spirit in our spirit by enjoying the divine Spirit through our spirit and by walking in our spirit in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE LAST ADAM BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians 15:45 says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>. The last Adam is Christ in the flesh, the Lamb of God who took away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ was the Word, God Himself John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This Word became flesh, becoming the Lamb of God to take away our sins John 1:14, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After taking away our sins through His death, this last Adam became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus has taken two great steps.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the first step He became flesh, and in the second step He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Originally He was merely God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then He took the first step, incarnation, to become the flesh for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After completing the work of redemption, in resurrection He took the second step to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, the first step was for redemption, and the second was for the giving of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most Christians know only the first step.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are totally unaware of the second.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How pitiful!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some today even oppose any mention of the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we tell them that the Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit, they say, This is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus is only the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the Son, He cannot be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why do you say that He is the life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the Bible clearly reveals that our Lord Jesus has taken two steps: the first step to become the flesh to take away our sins and the second step to become the life-giving Spirit to impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We once were poor, fallen people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We did not have life, but we had a great many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to save us, the Lord Jesus had to pass through these two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the first step He shed His blood for us to take away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then, in the second step, He became the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hallelujah, our sins are gone and life is here!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our Redeemer today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE LORD BEING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, Now the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No doubt, the Lord here is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE TWO SPIRITS BECOMING ONE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First Corinthians 6:17 is a marvelous verse: He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here we see that these two spirits have joined to become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How profound!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Have you ever realized that you can be one spirit with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we saw this fact, we would be beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We would say, Hallelujah, I am one spirit with the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I don t care about my temper or about Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I don t care about the demons, the scorpions, the snakes, or all the little bugs.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may need to tell those we meet, Don t touch me!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I m too great!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I m one spirit with the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you see the fact that you are one spirit with the Lord, the demons will be terrified.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is no need to have a long face and a wrinkled brow.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You need to see that you are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you saw this, you could never have a long face again.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Rather, your face would be shining.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do you truly believe this verse?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you did, could you still be cold and silent?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No, you would be beside yourself, shouting praises to the Lord and even jumping out of your seat.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What could be higher or greater than being one spirit with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How wonderful it is to be one spirit with Him!</S>
