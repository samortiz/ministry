   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE BEING THE MINGLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CREATED LIFE WITH THE UNCREATED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First John 1 speaks of the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all know that the central goal of the Bible is life, and the central goal of the universe is also life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The record of creation in Genesis 1 and 2 shows that life is the center of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many scientists consider the record in Genesis to be meaningless because it contains no record of the great matters in the universe related to astronomy and geography; instead, it records matters that are of no interest to astronomers, geographers, and scientists.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The center of this record is life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In brief, on the first and second days, there was no life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the third day, God caused the dry land to appear that plants might grow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the third day, there was plant life, which is the lowest life, a life without consciousness, without feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The plant life is the first kind of life spoken of in creation, and this life is the lowest life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the fifth and sixth days, the record goes from the lowest animal life to the higher mammal life, and among the mammals, the highest is the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, at the end of the record of creation, the human life created by God is the highest life among created life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once this life was created, God s image and authority are present.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both image and authority come with the highest created life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, once human life was created, God s image was with this human life, and God s authority was also committed to this human life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All these matters are recorded in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the sixth day, when man was created, it can be said that life reached its highest point.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But, in fact, this is still not the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, in chapter 2, God put the man He created in front of another life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God put man in front of the tree of life v. 9 ; that is, He put man in front of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the revelation of the Bible, the divine life is the highest life in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As far as created life is concerned, human life is the highest life; however, apart from created life, there is still an uncreated life, as indicated by the tree of life, the eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To put created life in front of uncreated life implies that the created life should receive the uncreated life, and the two should mingle together.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The joining together of the created life with the uncreated life is the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Life Coming from Light</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Genesis 1 and 2 show that life comes from light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The record of God s creation tells the story of creation in seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the first day, God said, Let there be light, and there was light 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the second day, God separated the waters above from the waters below.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the third day, the dry land appeared, and there was the lowest plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the fourth day, the light was intensified, and the sun, the moon, and the stars were manifested; once light becomes stronger, life also becomes stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The light on the first day is for producing plant life on the third day; the light on the fourth day is for producing animal life on the fifth and sixth days.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the plant life was produced by the light of the first day, and the animal life was produced by the light of the fourth day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Life Being in the Incarnated Christ</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we come to the tree of life in Genesis 2, we may not realize the kind of life that is referred to by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Psalm 36:9 says, With You is the fountain of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows that the source of life is God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At this point, we may have a little realization that the source of life for the tree of life is God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, this is not clear enough.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we continue our reading concerning the line of life and pay attention to life, we will eventually come to John 1:4, which says, In Him was life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here Him refers to the Word in verse 1, which says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Word was God, and in Him was life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we should be clearer that the life in the incarnated Christ is what is spoken of in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, because this is still not enough, we need to read further.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John 11:25 says, I am...the life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then 14:6 says, I am the way and the reality and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to be clear that the life spoken of in Genesis 2 is the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The incarnated God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, John 10:10 says, I have come that they may have life ; then 1 John 5:12 says, He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Also, Colossians 3:4 says, Christ our life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Finally, Revelation 22:2 speaks of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may say that the tree of life in the beginning of the Bible reappears at the end of the Bible after passing through the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Life Being the Central Goal</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>in the Entire Universe</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the book of Revelation, life is God s ultimate goal and the ultimate enjoyment of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Genesis 2, God put man in front of the tree of life for man to receive life; in Revelation 22, the tree of life has entered into man to be man s enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the beginning of the Bible, the created life was put in front of the tree of life in order that the created life might receive the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At the end of the Bible, the tree of life has become the enjoyment of the created life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The created and the uncreated life are fully mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, life is the central goal of the entire Bible, and in the whole universe, life is the central goal of God.</S>
