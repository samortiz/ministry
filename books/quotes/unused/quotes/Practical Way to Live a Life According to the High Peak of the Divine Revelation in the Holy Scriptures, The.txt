We do not just want to have a so-called seeing of the high peak, without taking care of touching it and entering into it
The general subject is: 'The Practical Way to Live a Life according to the High Peak of the Divine Revelation in the Holy Scriptures'
The title of this first message is: 'To Have a Clear View concerning the Accomplishments of the Processed and Consummated Triune God '
All the accomplishments of the processed and consummated Triune God are for the carrying out of His New Testament economy
These are the five categories, or five steps, of God's move: incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension

Isaiah 9:6 says that unto us a child is born and a son is given, yet His name shall be called the Mighty God, the Eternal Father
Micah 5:2 prophesies that a ruler would come forth from Bethlehem whose goings forth are from of old, from the days of eternity
In total, all these promises and prophecies indicated that one day God would come to be a man, to bring Himself into man
God's becoming a man means that God mingles divinity with humanity, making God and man, divinity and humanity, one entity
When you go shopping to buy food or in anything you do in your practical affairs, you should consider yourself a God-man
In His all-inclusive death Christ destroyed the devil, who has the might of death and who is related to the flesh of sin
In His death He also released the divine life from the one grain into many grains, signified by the flowing of water at the death of Christ
The life-giving Spirit is the reality of resurrection, which is Christ Himself and the processed and consummated Triune God
At the time when Christ in His humanity was born to be the firstborn Son of God, He became the life-giving Spirit
Such a transcending Christ is to be transmitted into the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all
Sometimes the management is small, but only God can carry this out to create the proper environment for people to be saved

He did promise mankind that a threefold seed would come: the seed of the woman , the seed of Abraham , and the seed of David
Micah 5:2 says that out of Bethlehem would come forth a ruler, whose goings forth are of old, from the days of eternity
In the whole universe there was God, there were the angels, there were men, but there had never been a God-man
Today our being the many sons of God is not based upon creation, but based upon God's selection, God's choosing
Within the divine life, there was the element of humanity, and within the human life, there was the element of divinity
Caesar Augustus was the first formal Caesar of the Roman Empire, who took possession of the land where this God-man lived
They know this just in black and white, but sorry to say, they do not know the intrinsic fact of this incarnation
The practical way to live a life according to the high peak of the divine revelation is that you must be a God-man
God's chosen people became fallen and lost, but He redeemed them back through the wonderful death of that wonderful Person, Christ
Christ made Himself, the first God-man, a prototype for the mass reproduction of many brothers the many God-men

Both 2 Corinthians 5:15 and Galatians 2:19 show that the believers in Christ should die to themselves and live to God
We can know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death
According to my experience and observations, nearly all of us Christians today understand the Bible according to three things
The Chinese, the Greeks, the Jews, the Arabs, the Indians from India, and the Japanese all have their particular philosophies
England, Germany, and France are close geographically, but the difference is great among their particular philosophies
In the unique resurrection Christ was born and we were regenerated, so we were His 'twins' in the same delivery
If you ask someone what has been accomplished by God in Christ's resurrection, he may simply say that God raised up Christ from the dead
In the same Bible there are three marvelous verses which show us the intrinsic significance of Christ's resurrection
God has been God from eternity to eternity, without beginning or ending, but God as a man is only about two thousand years old
In heaven Jesus sitting, Christ the Lord is there enthroned; As the man by God exalted, With God's glory He is crowned
God in Him on earth was humbled, God with man was domiciled; Man in Him in heav'n exalted, Man with God is reconciled
He as God with man is mingled, God in man is testified; He as man with God is blended, Man in God is glorified
From the Glorified in heaven The inclusive Spirit came; All of Jesus' work and Person Doth this Spirit here proclaim
A man is now in heaven As the Lord of all enthroned; This is Jesus Christ our Savior, With God's glory ever crowned!
After His ascension He is still the God-man, and through His death and resurrection, many God-men were reproduced
Lord, this is what we need, not only now but also for our whole life in dealing with You as the Word and the Spirit
Before the resurrection of Christ, there were not the many sons of God who were men regenerated to be God's sons
The firstborn Son, the many sons of God, and the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God issue in one thing

Abiding in Christ and having Him abide in us for the growth with His life in fruit-bearing is also a part of living Christ
Also, to live Christ includes growing into Christ in everything that we may mature in the measure of the stature of Christ
If a Roman soldier had asked Paul what he was doing, Paul would have been able to say, 'I am living Christ for His magnification
At the end of the book of Philippians he said, 'All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household'
No doubt, he was saved from eternal perdition by Christ, but he still needed to be saved from the shame of not living Christ
Paul's earnest expectation and hope was that he would live Christ for His magnification to participate in Christ's salvation in life
If others had seen Paul overwhelmed with sorrow with anxiety with sadness and with despair that would have been a shame and a defeat to him
Now we must see that we need to be conformed to the image of God's Son that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers
On the other hand if all of his brothers were the same as he is everyone would say that they are his twins because they all look the same
In the new man there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free man

The nine items listed above speak of the nature, the element, and essence of what the Body of Christ should be
When we all grow together in everything into Christ this is a corporate growing so it affords a corporate building up of the Body of Christ
