<h1 class="title">OUR USEFULNESS IN THE LORD&rsquo;S HAND</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE LITERATURE WORK</h2>
<p>The saints who labor in the literature work need a proper understanding. It may seem that the work done in the editorial room is insignificant, but it is greater than the work of speaking from the podium. We distributed over one hundred forty thousand copies of the pamphlet concerning how to enjoy God. This shows that the literature work is not a small matter. Therefore, we should not despise the work in our hand. The editorial room may seem small, but the work is not small.</p>
<p>In Washington, D. C., there was a Chinese sister who met with us, and she asked where she could find messages that were similar to the ones that she had heard. This sister attended meetings in different places but had never heard messages like the ones in our meetings. Our messages touched her inner being. For this reason she asked where she could find more messages. I referred her to the Gospel Book Room in Taipei and told her that it published many books and had recently printed a pamphlet on how to enjoy God. I also wrote the Book Room and requested that some copies of <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> magazine and books on the enjoyment of God be sent to her. In a short time, she received the publications. Since she did not want to receive the books for free, she made a small payment to the Book Room.</p>
<p>In a letter to me she wrote, &ldquo;Among the so-called spiritual books in this age, one can rarely find words that shine forth so brightly. I pray that the Lord will use you and that your books will be translated into many languages to enlighten and satisfy the hungry ones everywhere. After you left, my husband was saved, and he now meets with some brothers once a week to pray. I thank the Lord that we have His presence, oneness, and sweet fellowship. The brothers and sisters are praying for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This testimony should burden us to pray for the literature work. The brothers and sisters who are laboring in the literature work should be encouraged by the great and urgent need among Christians and by their positive response to our literature.</p>
<p>This is the reason that we should translate some of the important messages into English. People in Japan also understand English. We met a Japanese brother who is a university graduate and speaks very good English. We spoke with him in English and had no problem understanding him. When we were in Japan, I sometimes spoke a message in Chinese, and a brother would translate it into English, because we do not have brothers who speak Japanese fluently enough to translate my messages. The majority of people in Japan with a college education understand English.</p>
<p>The situation is the same in other countries. People who have higher education understand English. We do not need to use advanced English grammar when we translate our messages. Simple English is good enough. Even though the English is simple, it is full of spiritual content. This is similar to using the level of English spoken in elementary school to explain an important scientific principle. The ministry will spread farther if we publish our books in English. I believe that this is the Lord&rsquo;s leading. If our literature does not go out and if the saints rarely go out for the propagation, we will be limited in what we can supply to other believers. For example, during my trip overseas, I did not have much opportunity to contact people and I was not able to speak many messages. Moreover, only a limited number of people, maybe not more than two thousand, were able to attend the meetings that we held in the different places. If the literature goes out, however, it will reach more people. Through the written word people will become clear concerning the messages that the Lord is releasing among us.</p>
<p>Because Brother T. Austin-Sparks often speaks of us in his ministry, many places in America and Europe are aware of us. However, they do not know what kind of &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; we have. They are not clear concerning our ministry, because our literature does not reach them. Thus far only two books are available to believers in the West. One book&mdash;<em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em>&mdash;is composed of messages given by Brother Nee in London twenty years ago. The other&mdash;<em>The Normal Christian Life</em>&mdash;stirred up a strong response when it was released, and it has rendered much help to many believers.</p>
<p>There are also a few articles written by a sister in the West and published in Brother Sparks&rsquo; magazine, <em>A Witness and a Testimony</em>. Last summer, when Brother Sparks held his annual conference, many believers read the articles. One of our brothers who attended the conference said that the articles in the magazine did not adequately represent what was available through our ministry. The believers abroad do not know about the work that we are doing in the Far East. They do not know our ministry or our focus. However, once our literature goes out, they will be clear concerning our focus, and I am convinced that this is what they need.</p>
<p>Believers in the West do not have the messages that our literature provides. The books in Christianity do not contain what we have. Hence, the believers are spiritually impoverished. Not many good Christian books have been printed in recent years; therefore, in America classical Christian books from the second and third centuries are being reprinted. There is a market for these books in seminaries and Christian libraries, and believers who seek the Lord are collecting these books. In recent years a large number of out-of-print classics have been reprinted. Books concerning church history and books written by the church fathers are also being reprinted in large sizes and in sets.</p>
<p>The reprinting of spiritual classics indicates that not many books with content have been printed in recent years. The subject matter of nearly all of the new books is sugarcoated; the books do not have any content. This is the condition of Christianity in the West. Except for the magazine <em>A Witness and a Testimony,</em> put out by Brother Sparks, the publications available to believers do not contain any substance. Most of them contain only promotional material, advertisements, and photographs.</p>
<p>If the Lord would have mercy on us and raise up some brothers to translate our literature into English, there will be a good response after our literature is distributed. The Lord did not give us these messages only for us; they are for His entire Body. We should enjoy these messages in the Far East, and the churches in the West should also receive the supply. Therefore, the messages that we labor on are the foundation. As soon as there are saints available to do the translation work, we should translate our books into English. This will be a great benefit to the believers in the West. The translation work is somewhat easier than the work on the original messages. The saints who are preparing the messages to be printed in Chinese are laboring to put out the spiritual supply in a solid way. This labor is worthwhile. For the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, we must continue in this work.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Perfecting of the Saints and the Building Up of the House of God &nbsp; pg 42</div><br></body></html>
