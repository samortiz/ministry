<h1 class="title">Taking Christ as Our Secret and as Our Power</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 4:11-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The subject of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ in every kind of circumstance&mdash; 1:19-21a; 2:5; 3:9-10; 4:11-13.</li>
<li>In Philippians 4 Christ is the secret and the power for us to enjoy; we know the secret, and we have the power&mdash;vv. 12-13.</li>
<li>Paul had learned the secret of sufficiency, of satisfaction, of contentment; this secret is actually Christ Himself&mdash;vv. 11-12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In any environment and in any matter, Paul, who experienced Christ richly and abundantly, learned the secret to be content and to rejoice always&mdash;v. 4.</li>
	<li>According to the book of Philippians as a whole, the secret Paul learned was simply Christ; Paul took Christ as the secret to experience Christ, being content and rejoicing in any situation and in any matter because of Christ.</li>
	<li>Paul had not only learned a secret; he had been initiated and had learned certain basic principles&mdash;v. 12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul had been initiated both into the proper Christian life and into the proper church life.</li>
		<li>After Paul was converted to Christ, he was initiated into Christ and into the Body of Christ&mdash;Acts 9:3-19, 25-28; 22:6-21; 13:1-4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He was initiated into the basic principles of Christ and the church.</li>
			<li>He learned the secret of how to take Christ as life (Col. 3:4), how to live Christ (Phil. 1:21a), how to magnify Christ (v. 20), how to gain Christ (3:8, 12), and how to have the church life (1:8, 19; 2:1-4, 19-20; 4:1-3).</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we are saved and come into the church, the Body of Christ, we need to be initiated by learning certain basic principles&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We are initiated in Christ, with Christ, and by Christ; because Christ is our secret, we know how to face any kind of situation.</li>
		<li>Because the church has a mysterious aspect, we need to be initiated by learning certain basic principles&mdash;Eph. 3:3, 9; 5:32.</li>
		<li>The secret of the Body is to take Christ as our life, to live Christ, to pursue Christ, to gain Christ, to magnify Christ, and to express Christ; these are the basic principles of the church, the Body of Christ&mdash; Rom. 12:4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li><em>In everything</em> refers to a particular time when we experience a certain thing of the Lord; <em>in all things</em> refers to a broad range of experiences over time&mdash;Phil. 4:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul could say that both on a particular occasion and on all occasions, both at a certain time and throughout the course of his life, he had learned the secret.</li>
		<li>Paul experienced Christ moment by moment:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He experienced Christ in particular things at particular times.</li>
			<li>He experienced Christ in all things and at all times.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In verse 13 we have a basic principle related to Paul&rsquo;s secret of sufficiency in Christ: &ldquo;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me&rdquo;:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The secret in Philippians 4 is to do all things in Christ&mdash;John 15:4a, 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Whatever we do should be done in Christ, not in ourselves; this is the secret Paul learned and the secret we need to learn today.</li>
		<li>It is sufficient for us to be in Christ, for He is all-inclusive.</li>
		<li>The way to experience Christ is to do everything in Him.</li>
		<li>If we do all things in Christ, we shall experience Christ, enjoy Christ, and accumulate Christ; this is the way to become rich in Christ and to have many rich experiences of Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:8.</li>
		<li>The issue of practicing the secret of being in Christ is that for us to live is Christ; because we do all things in Christ, we live Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s word in 4:13 is an all-inclusive and concluding word on his experience of Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul was a person in Christ, and he desired to be found by others in Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 12:2a; Phil. 3:9.</li>
		<li>In 4:13 he declared that, being in Christ, he could do all things in Him, the very Christ who empowered him; this was his secret.</li>
		<li>As a person in Christ, Paul experienced Christ and applied Him in all circumstances&mdash;vv. 11-12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Paul applied the Christ in whom he could be found&mdash;3:9.</li>
			<li>This Christ is real, living, near, available, and prevailing&mdash;4:5b.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To be empowered is to be made dynamic inwardly&mdash; v. 13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ dwells in us, and He empowers us, makes us dynamic, from within, not from without&mdash;Col. 1:27.</li>
		<li>By such an inward empowering Paul could do all things in Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s word about Christ as the empowering One specifically applies to Christ&rsquo;s empowering us to live Him as our human virtues and thereby to magnify Him in His unlimited greatness&mdash;Phil. 4:8-13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The application of verse 13 is limited by the context of verses 8 through 13.</li>
		<li>By the empowering of Christ we can live a contented life and be true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of&mdash;vv. 11-12, 8.</li>
		<li>To live a life of these virtues is much more difficult than doing a Christian work.</li>
		<li>We are persons in Christ, who empowers us to live out every kind of virtue; this is to live Christ and to magnify Him in His virtues&mdash;1:20-21a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we would experience Christ as the empowering One, we need to let Him live in us (Gal. 2:20), be formed in us (4:19), make His home in us (Eph. 3:17a), and be magnified in us (Phil. 1:20):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we fail to do these things, Christ will not have the way to empower us.</li>
		<li>When Christ lives in us, is formed in us, makes His home in us, and is magnified in us, the way is prepared for Him to empower us; then, empowered by the indwelling Christ, we shall be able to do all the things spoken of in 4:8-12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
