   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING IN THE PROPER CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the second aspect of the Lord s recovery today the practice of the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The genuine experience of Christ always issues in and demands the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more you experience Christ, the more something within requires that you live in the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Satan is subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Throughout the centuries, he has concealed the real experience of Christ, making Christ altogether objective, an object of human belief and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But once we experience Christ in a genuine and living way, He will require us to get into the church life because the dispensation of Christ into us is for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God dispenses Himself into us as everything for the purpose of gaining His corporate expression, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The experience of Christ is somewhat hidden and mysterious, but the practice of the church life is quite complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How confused is the situation today regarding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Look around you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Where is the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can see the Catholic Church with all its idols, images, and pagan things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The so-called Catholic charismatic movement even tolerates the worship of Mary, exposing the impurity of that movement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consider all the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They only have division and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every denomination is a deviation from God s center lane.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some denominations are larger and others are smaller, some are farther away and some are closer, but none of them is in the center lane.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What about the free groups?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are too free.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the members of the body are so free, the body is dismembered and ceases to be a body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we survey the situation of today s Christians, we see that there is no real church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, there is a need of the recovery of the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>TWO REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROPER CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to have the proper church life, we must have two main things: Christ, the life-giving Spirit, as the content, and the standing on the ground of unity in locality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Anaheim, we are not standing on any doctrine; we are standing on the unity of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wherever we are in San Francisco, Cleveland, New York, or any other city we must be one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we stand for doctrines, we shall be divided immediately, for one will have his concept, another his opinion, and still another his view.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when we take Christ as our life, as our person, and as our everything, this Christ within us will require the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In fact, the Christ in us will become the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ both requires and becomes the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eighteen years ago, some young learners under my training in Taiwan were influenced by a certain ministry of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result, they began to declare that they had seen the vision concerning Christ and that they wanted nothing to do with the church, saying that they cared only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We had the full assurance that this was not something of the Lord, and after a period of time their number gradually decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not experience Christ, we shall have nothing, and if we experience Christ but do not want to have the church life, we shall also become nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Having Christ without the church is like having the head without the body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there is no body, then there is no head.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must have both.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What would you do if there were no church life in the United States?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If there were no church life, I would feel that it would be useless to go on living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I cannot live without the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have seen that in order to have the church life, we must have the real experience of Christ and the proper standing on the ground of unity in localities.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because we have seen this vision, we do not have any divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s intention is to have a corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the book of Revelation, each of the local churches was in its own locality, and there was never more than one church in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, the church in Ephesus was in Ephesus and the church in Smyrna was in Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church in Smyrna equaled the city of Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Revelation 1:11 makes this very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE PREPARATION OF THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Revelation 19:6-9 we are told that the Lamb s Wife has made herself ready and that the marriage supper of the Lamb has come.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day, the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb, will be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if there were no church life on earth today, how could the Bride be prepared?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Could the Bride be prepared in the Catholic Church or in the denominations?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Could she be prepared in the free groups or in the charismatic movement?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I believe strongly, not because I am in it but because I have seen the vision, that the Lord intends to spread His recovery to build up the proper church life throughout the world that His Bride might be made ready.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Wife of the Lamb in chapter nineteen of Revelation is smaller than the Wife in chapter twenty-one, for the Wife in chapter nineteen is the Bride during the millennium composed of only the overcoming believers, and the Wife in chapter twenty-one will be the Wife in the new heaven and the new earth after the millennium in eternity, consisting of all of God s redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that at the end of this age, the church will be ready, but not in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, a small number, the remnant, the overcomers, will be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is a shame to be in the Lord s recovery and yet not be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everyone in the Lord s recovery must be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To be an overcomer means to overcome degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must leave religion and get into the Lord s recovery of the full experience of Christ and of the proper practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do this, whenever we come together, we shall be the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This will be a shame to the enemy and a preparation for Christ s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I believe that the preparation of the Bride for the Lord s coming back is in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is why I have the complete confidence that nothing will be able to suppress the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The recovery is like a ball filled with heavenly pneuma: the more you hold it down, the higher it rises.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I hope that you will bring these two items into your prayer, saying, Lord, show us the consummate experience of Christ and the real, practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Lord, we shall live in this and die for it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May we all see the vision that the Lord s recovery today concerns the experience of Christ and the practical church life.</S>
