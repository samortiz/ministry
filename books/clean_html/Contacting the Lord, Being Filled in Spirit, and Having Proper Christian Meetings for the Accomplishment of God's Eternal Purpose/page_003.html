<h2 class="head2">The Accomplishment of God&rsquo;s Eternal Purpose</h2>
<p>How does God accomplish that which He has purposed? How does God gain a group of people to express and represent Him? God accomplishes His purpose through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. In incarnation God Himself became a man. In so doing He joined and mingled Himself with man. Jesus was a God-man, a man joined and mingled with God. This man lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years and then died on the cross. His death was all-inclusive; when He died, everything died with Him (cf. 2 Cor. 5:14). Following His death, He rose from the dead, and in His resurrection He imparted His life into man (John 12:24; 1 Pet. 1:3). In incarnation He brought God into man, and in resurrection He brought man into God (John 14:6, 20). This was the way God accomplished His eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Application of the Accomplishment<br />
of God&rsquo;s Eternal Purpose</h2>
<p>Now we need to see how this accomplishment is applied to us. The application of the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is carried out absolutely in and by the Spirit. On the day of Pentecost, following the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the Holy Spirit was poured out from the heavens to the earth. This Spirit is all-inclusive. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection are all in this Spirit, who is the realization of Christ. God the Father is embodied in the Son, and God the Son is realized as the Spirit (14:10, 16-20). In this Spirit is everything that we need.</p>
<p>The Spirit takes three steps in applying the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose to us: He regenerates us, transforms us, and causes us to realize that we are members of the Body. When we first heard the gospel and received the Lord, the all-inclusive Spirit entered into us and regenerated us (3:6). In regeneration we received God Himself as life into us. This was the beginning of our spiritual life. Regeneration is the first step that the Spirit takes in applying the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose to us. After regenerating us, the Spirit continues to work in us to transform us from our old, human nature into a new, divine nature. This is the second step that the Spirit takes in applying the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose to us. The third step that the Spirit takes is to work in us to cause us to realize that we are members of the Body of Christ. The Spirit works in us, demanding that we enter into the Body life, the church life. While the Spirit is transforming us, we will have the realization that we must fellowship with others and have a meeting life. A meeting life is a life of meeting with other Christians. This is the life of the Body. We can never be individual Christians. Instead, we must join ourselves to other believers. This is a demand of the Spirit within us.</p>
 <p>If you meet with the Lord in the morning by yourself, surely the Lord within you will lead you to meet with the saints in the evening. Whenever you go to the Lord, the Lord will send you to the saints. This is because the Lord&rsquo;s desire is to have a built-up Body as His corporate expression. At the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, His work of transformation in us will be completed, and He will transform even our body into His glorious likeness (Phil. 3:21). At that time we with all the saints will be a divine, corporate expression, manifesting and expressing God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit. May we all go to the Lord and consider where we are in relation to these three matters&mdash;God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, and the application of the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
