   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Rejecting Everyone Who Goes Beyond</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Teaching of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2 John 7-11 the apostle John charged the saints that if some did not bring them the teaching of Christ but preached that Jesus Christ did not come in the flesh, they should neither receive such ones into their house nor even greet them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 3 John 9-10 Diotrephes, who loved to be first, would not receive the Lord s workers, including John, but babbled against them with evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, he forbade those intending to receive them and cast them out of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that John was merely carrying out the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the leading one is not an individual person but the apostles teaching; it is the faith that leads the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the very beginning of the Lord s recovery in mainland China, Brother Nee was clearly in the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, having worked with him for eighteen years, I can testify on his behalf that I cannot remember one instance in which he took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One time a co-worker asked him, Brother Nee, I have a burden to go to Nanchang in Kiangsi Province.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How do you feel?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time Brother Nee was at home in his rocking chair.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After being asked repeatedly, he continued not to say anything but kept rocking in his chair.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, Brother Nee replied, How do you feel?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When dinnertime came, he went to eat and did not continue the conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Later I asked Brother Nee why he remained silent when someone asked him a question.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He told me, This brother had already made the decision to go to Nanchang.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I were to tell him that he should go, he would go, but if I were to tell him that he should not go, he would still go.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He came to ask me simply because he wanted to receive an endorsement so that he could say that Brother Nee wanted him to go.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why should I do that?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even if I were to ask him not to go, in the end he would still go, because he had already made the arrangement to go.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He came to me merely to receive an endorsement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows that Brother Nee was not the so-called leading one; otherwise, if he felt that this brother should not go, he would have told him not to go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was not the directing one, nor did he desire to be the directing one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Nee also realized that even if he expressed how he felt, people might not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After I went abroad, many people have attempted to add the title of pope to me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consequently, I would like to ask whether I have been the directing one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since 1949 I truly took the lead in the church and the work in Taiwan; nevertheless, from 1961 to 1984, a period of twenty-three years, I have never directed the church in Taipei to do anything nor have I interfered with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I remember correctly, when I was first in the United States, Brother Chang Yu-nan wrote me every week, providing me with detailed fellowship concerning the church, and the letter was co-signed by Brother Chang Wu-chen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, Brother Yu-nan became physically quite weak, so Brother Wu-chen began writing me every two to six months.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After some initial leading, I ceased to inquire about the matters related to the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moreover, as a result of our publication work, at least six hundred churches were raised up in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>None of them are under my control.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is strong proof that I am not the directing one and that I have no intention to be such.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, I am burdened that all the churches would walk according to the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there is any discrepancy between the churches and the apostles teaching, I must speak up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This proves that, according to the fellowship in the New Testament, it should be the apostles teaching in the New Testament, not any person, that takes the lead among us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since my return to Taiwan in 1984 in order to change the system and bring in the new way, it may seem that I have done so much and that I am directing everything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nevertheless, if someone inquires of the elders in the church in Taipei, he will find out that I have been in constant fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everything related to the church in Taipei has passed through the meeting, discussion, and decision of the elders before it was carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do not simply do whatever I tell them; this would not be right.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Neither is it right for two or three to make a decision and do something simply because they all agree that things should be done in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, everything needs to be carried out according to the principle of the elders administration of the church; that is, the elders discuss matters together, seek the Lord s leading together, and make every decision in the elders meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the decision is made, then they need to discuss who will carry out the matter; this person will be appointed in the elders meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the beginning of 1949 until 1988, not one local church on the island of Taiwan or anywhere else on the entire globe has received orders from me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many times brothers have written to me and told me of the problems they are encountering and have asked me for advice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I often have answered by saying that they should bring this matter before the Lord in prayer and ask for His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a church does not walk according to the apostles teaching, this is truly a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I returned to Taiwan in 1965 to handle the matter related to the four dissenting co-workers, I followed this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must realize that the way we are taking is not the way of human organization but the way of following the apostles teaching in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything is under the leadership of the apostles teaching, that is, God s New Testament economy, the faith of God in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether in the work or in the church, we should rely upon the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The apostles teaching is the constitution of the church and the work.</S>
