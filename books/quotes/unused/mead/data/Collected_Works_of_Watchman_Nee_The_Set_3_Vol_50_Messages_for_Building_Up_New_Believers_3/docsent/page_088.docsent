   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. The Sixth Church Philadelphia</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Next comes the sixth church; it has the name Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Phila means "love" and delphia means "the brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Phila- delphia means "brotherly love."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Returning to Brotherly Love</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Among the seven churches, this is the only one which does not receive any rebuke from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Roman Catholic Church was rebuked, and so were the Protestant churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only Philadelphia is not rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One only finds praise in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What are the characteristics of Philadelphia?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Revelation 3:8 says, "I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the characteristic of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The characteristic of Thyatira is the teaching of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The characteristic of Sardis is a union between the church and the world and a constant need for separation; it is a continuous struggle between life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the characteristic of Philadelphia is brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here is a return to brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no worldliness here because all are brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no need to struggle to separate oneself from death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a return to the original state of brotherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we find brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as Sardis comes out of Thyatira, Philadelphia comes out of Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Protestants came out of the Roman Catholic Church, and Philadelphia came out of the Protestants.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was clearly a new move of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This new move attracted people from the dead Sardis and put them on the ground of brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, they stood on the Body ground.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They did not recognize any other relationship except the relationship of brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They did not recognize any other fellowship except the fellowship of love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Keeping the Lord's Word</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Philadelphia had two characteristics: They kept the Lord's word, and they did not deny the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here was a group of people who were led by God to keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God opened up the Word to them, and others were able to understand His Word through them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They had no creed, doctrine, or tradition, only the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the time of Philadelphia, we find a group of people returning fully to the Word of the Lord, who did not recognize any other authority, doctrine, or creed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A man can understand and even preach a doctrine, but this does not mean that he understands the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He can memorize creeds and proclaim his faith in them, but this does not mean that he understands the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord would have given us creeds long ago if the church needed them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today men analyze the Bible and condense its teachings into creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Creeds are limited, but the Bible is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Creeds are simple, while the Bible is complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A foolish man can understand creeds if he studies them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But a foolish man cannot understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only a certain type of people can understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only under certain conditions can a man understand God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Creeds open a wide door and anyone can go in. But the door to God's Word is not that wide, and only those with life can enter it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The door of the creeds is so wide that a smart mind is all one needs to enter it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But God's Word is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Unless a man has life and is single before the Lord, he will not see or understand His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people think that God's Word is too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They want to broaden it so that they can bring more people into it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But those in Philadelphia rejected all creeds and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They turned back to the Word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord said, "You...have kept My word."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In church history, there was never an age when men understood God's Word more than those in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Philadelphia God's Word was given its rightful place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In other ages men accepted creeds and traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But Philadelphia accepted nothing other than God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It returned to His Word and walked in it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In church history there was never a time when the ministry of the Word was as rich as that which we find in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not Denying the Lord's Name</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord said, "You...have not denied My name" v. 8 . This is another characteristic of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the long history of the church throughout the ages, the name of the Lord Jesus has always been last in importance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Men pay attention to names of saints, such as Peter and other apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They pay attention to names they like or to names of doctrines and nations.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many say proudly, "I am a Lutheran," or "I am a Wesleyan."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Oh, the names of men!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many claim proudly, "I am a Coptic" of a place , or "I am an Anglican" meaning British .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These are names of countries.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These names have divided God's children into divisions!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is as if the name of Christ were not enough to separate us from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If someone asks you, "Who are you?" and you answer, "I am a Christian," he will not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He will ask again, "What kind of Christian are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I remember once when I was in another country, a man asked me, "What are you really?"</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I said, "I am a Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He said, "This is meaningless!"</S>
