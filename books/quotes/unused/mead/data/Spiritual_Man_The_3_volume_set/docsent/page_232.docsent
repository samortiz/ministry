   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" Matt 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word "souls" especially refers to the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus knows the trials His people pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just as the Father dealt with the Lord, He knows how the heavenly Father will cause the believers to be lonely, misunderstood, and neglected by man v. 27 . He knows that the heavenly Father will allow many unpleasant things to fall upon the believers so that they may be weaned from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He also knows how the souls of the believers feel in the fire of the furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, He said that we should learn from Him so that our emotion may find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was meek; He did not care how people treated Him but joyfully endured contradictions from sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was lowly; He humbled Himself willingly and had no ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ambitious ones are troubled, angered, and restless when they cannot attain what they desire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord lived in this world meekly and humbly so His emotion never boiled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said that we need to learn from Him, and that we should be as meek and lowly as He.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He said that we need to take His yoke upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the restriction borne by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord also took His yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He took the yoke of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was satisfied with God's will alone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as God knew Him, it did not matter if others were against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was willing to accept the restrictions given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He said we need to take His yoke, accept His restraint, and walk according to His will alone, not seeking after the freedom of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then our emotion will not be bothered and troubled by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the believer is willing to receive the cross of the Lord and fully submit to Him, he will see that the emotion will not be disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is nothing less than a satisfied life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The believer desires nothing else because he has obtained the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is fully satisfied with the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God Himself has filled his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He considers all that God has given him, arranged for him, required of him, and commanded him is good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is satisfied if he can follow God's will and does not seek after his own desire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He had many wild desires before, but he has learned how to die to his own desire and be satisfied with God's will alone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, he does not seek after what he likes, not because he forces himself, but because the will of God has filled him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is satisfied and has no other seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of living can only be expressed fully by the word satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The characteristic of spiritual living is satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not self-satisfaction or self-sufficiency, nor is it to consider oneself to be in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The meaning of satisfaction is that the believer has obtained all that he needs in God that is, in God's will , and he considers God's will as the best.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, he is satisfied and desires no more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Emotional believers have many desires because they do not consider that God has arranged the best.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, they desire to gain more, become higher, bigger, and happier, have more glory, and be more prominent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once the Holy Spirit has worked deeply through the cross, a believer no longer loves anything according to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His desires are filled by God; hence, he desires nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At this stage, the believer's desire is fully renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This does not mean that he never fails after this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His desire has been united with God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At this moment, not only does the believer not resist the Lord negatively, but he delights in what the Lord delights in positively.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He does not compel himself to suppress his own desires; rather, he delights in what God requires of him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He delights in God's delights.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If God wants him to suffer, he asks God to make him suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He feels this kind of suffering is sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If it pleases God for him to be wounded, he joyously uses his hands to inflict wounds on himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He delights in the affliction more than in healing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If God wants him to be lowly, he is happy to cooperate with God and humble himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He only likes what God likes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He does not seek anything apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Unless God exalts him, he does not wish to be exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He does not resist God; he welcomes all of God's doings whether they are bitter or sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The cross produces fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All crucifixions will gain the fruit of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All those who are willing to accept the practical cross that God has given them will find themselves living a spiritual life without mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to practice taking the cross every day according to God's desire for us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every cross has its particular mission to fulfill as part of God's work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May we not allow any cross to come upon us in vain.</S>
