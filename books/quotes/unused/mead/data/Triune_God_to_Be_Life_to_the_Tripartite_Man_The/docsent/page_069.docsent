   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE THIRTEEN DYING TO SELF AND LIVING TO GOD Scripture Reading: Matt 16:24; Rom 7:17-18, 11, 13; 1 Pet 2:24m; Gal 2:19; Rom 16:26; Psa 36:9a; Col 2:9; 2 Cor 3:17-18, 6b; Phil 1:19b, 20b-21a; 4:8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians consider that the Bible tells us that men should be good to one another and that men must learn to fear God, please God, and behave before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although this is a common concept concerning the Bible, it is not completely accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was young, I also held this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But gradually, year by year, as I have read and studied the Bible, I have come to realize that the Bible is a book that unveils God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word for economy is oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Oikonomia refers to the plan, the arrangement, for the accomplishment of a certain purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible, God's economy is His household administration to carry out His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The central point of God's administration is the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The cross of Christ is the centrality and universality of the way of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Christian life is a life which can accomplish God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the earth today, it is difficult to find a man who considers that he should live a life for the carrying out of God's purpose and economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must live a life which comes up to the standard of accomplishing God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is what God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The kind of life which accomplishes God's economy is a life which is always dying to self and living to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christians may speak about doing God's will, but most consider God's will only in relation to minor things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Pharisees were concerned with such things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They condemned John the Baptist because he did not eat bread or drink wine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They also condemned the Lord Jesus as a gluttonous man and a wine drinker because He did eat and drink Luke 7:33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such talks are merely religious and have nothing to do with what kind of person we should be for the accomplishment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to live for the accomplishment of God's purpose, we need to die to self and live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>DYING TO SELF</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Matthew 16:24 the Lord spoke of our need to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To deny ourselves is to die to self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our very being is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The self is expressed and manifested in our natural life and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is a distinction between the words expressed and manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To express ourselves is a matter of behavior, but to manifest ourselves is a matter of what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the full-time training, the way the trainees appear in the meetings is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is their expression.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when the trainees go home, they may live in an altogether different manner.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is their manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every Christian has two faces.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the meeting, we express ourselves in one way, and in our room or at home we are manifested in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must exercise until we are the same in the meeting as we are at home.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The self is expressed and manifested in our natural life and flesh, and our flesh is the embodiment of sin Rom 7:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you do not restrict or behave yourself, you manifest yourself in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To manifest yourself in the flesh is sin, and sin is one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to Romans 7, sin deceives and kills v. 11 . These are the things that Satan did in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Satan deceived Eve 2 Cor 11:3 , and through partaking of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve were deadened Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Apparently, it is sin which deceives and kills.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, it is Satan who deceives and kills.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sin and Satan are one; sin and Satan are synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our being, our self, our natural life, our flesh, sin, and Satan are all one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They are like many eggs in one nest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In a nest a mother bird may have a cluster of eggs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When these eggs are hatched, they will form one family, one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our being, our self, our natural life, our flesh, sin, and Satan are like one family in a nest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To die to self means to die to the entire family.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For this reason the Lord said in Matthew 16, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me" v. 24 . To deny the self is to die to self.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first two lines of a hymn translated by Brother Nee express this same thought: "To the foe my word is always, 'No,' / To the Father it is 'Yes'" Hymns, #880 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To say "No" to Satan is to die to self.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we die to self, our natural life, our flesh, sin, and Satan are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we die to self, Satan is defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why Satan is afraid of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Dying to self is dying to our natural life, our flesh, sin, and Satan through the cross 1 Pet 2:24m .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The cross puts us to death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It ends our self.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The cross is the centrality and universality of our way to live the Christian life in order to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we die to self, we die to everything in this universe but God.</S>
