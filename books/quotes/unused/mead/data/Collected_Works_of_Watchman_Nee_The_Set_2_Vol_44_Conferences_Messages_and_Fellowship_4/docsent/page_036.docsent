   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ANOINTING AND PRAYER OF THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In James 5:14-16 we see the laying on of hands in relation to sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the case of sickness we are instructed by James to call for the elders of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders, rather than the members of the church who have the gift of healing, need to be called because the sick persons in this case need to be brought under the anointing; their case must be dealt with by the representatives of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The sins referred to in verse 15 are particular sins; they are sins against the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How do we know that the sickness here is a special kind of sickness and not ordinary sickness?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we know the remedy that a doctor prescribes, then we can deduce the type of illness that a patient has.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the patient is brought under the anointing, we can safely infer that the patient's sickness was due to a departure from the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Word of God plainly declares that many are weak and sick, and many have even died, because of the failure to discern the Lord's Body 1 Cor 11:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>James 5 presents such a case.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are living in the realm of the Body, then we are always under the anointing of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, as soon as we take an individual line, we depart from the anointing and expose ourselves to sickness and death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sin of the man in James 5 must have been the sin of detaching himself from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If his sin was only a personal sin, he could have been forgiven by trusting in the blood and by confessing to others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There would have been no need to ask the elders to anoint him with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The elders' oil cannot remove sin; only the blood can remove sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 15 says that he will be forgiven if he has sinned; however, the forgiveness is due to the elders' prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, this sin is not an ordinary sin; it is the sin of acting contrary to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a consequence, there is the need to ask the elders of the church to pray for him and to anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord so that he can be brought back under the Head and into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 16 says, "Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse tells us to confess our sins to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to confess to one another because something is wrong in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sphere of confession corresponds with the sphere of transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If I have only sinned against God, I must make my confession to Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sin in these verses is a sin against the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since something has gone wrong in the Body of Christ, both the sick one and the elders have to take responsibility for it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The sick one has offended the Body, and the elders represent the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the sick one has to confess, and the elders also have to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Note that confession is mutual.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sick one confesses, but the elders also confess.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sick one acknowledges that the sickness is a result of taking an individual position, and the elders acknowledge that they have failed in the matter of love and watchfulness; otherwise, the sick one would not have departed from the ground of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the mutual confession, there is prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Pray for one another."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that the elders pray for the sick, and the sick pray for the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The result is that the sin is forgiven, and the sickness is healed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Mutuality is the characteristic of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you see how the Body is highlighted in anointing, confession, and prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Body every member should have love and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Being outside the Body brings in not only physical sickness but also spiritual sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who are outside of the Body should see the importance of turning back to the anointing and turning back to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is through these turns that they will receive the help of the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE REVELATION PAUL RECEIVED</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>AT THE TIME OF HIS CONVERSION</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the case of Paul's conversion we have a further illustration of the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Acts 9 shows us two characteristics of the revelation that Paul received at the time of his conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the Lord appeared to Paul on the way to Damascus, He showed him that persecuting the believers was the same as persecuting Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord asked, "Why are you persecuting Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He did not ask, "Why are you persecuting those who believe in Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul asked, "Who are You, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom you persecute."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord showed Paul that he was persecuting the Head when he was persecuting the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When you damage any member of the Body, you damage the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every sin that offends the Body offends the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every believer of the Lord is one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the oneness of the Head with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul was the first one who saw the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The day that the Lord revealed Himself was the day that Paul saw the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After this high revelation, the Lord charged him to go into the city, and there it would be told to him what he must do v. 6 . This was also a revelation of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After such a high revelation, the Lord did not speak to him directly; rather, He committed him to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the day Paul was saved, the Lord showed him the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Three days later the Lord sent a small disciple by the name of Ananias to lay hands on him, and Ananias said to him, "Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me Jesus, who appeared to you on the road on which you were coming so that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit" v. 17 . Ananias was just an ordinary brother.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We know nothing about his history before or after this event.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When he was sent by the Lord to Saul, he said, "Saul, brother."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This ushered Saul into the Body of Christ, filled him with the Holy Spirit, and brought him under the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>THE JUDGMENT OF TWO OR THREE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Matthew 18:15-16 is not about whether a person is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is not even about whether a person feels that he is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is about the testimony of two or three brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If they say that you are wrong, you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, when other brothers say that you are wrong, and you do not feel that you are wrong, you should take their judgment and believe in them more than in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If two or three brothers stand in the name of the Lord and say something to you, you should listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the church there are four groups of people representing the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They are: 1 the apostles, 2 the elders, 3 those whom the Lord has specially chosen, and 4 two or three believers who deny themselves and who have come under the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>These four groups of people represent the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we are wrong, the Lord will send a believer to us to speak to us about it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we do not listen to the word of one believer, he will tell two or three other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we still do not listen to their word, we should receive help from the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We cannot have any independent actions.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For problems that cannot be solved, we should consult the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They are designated by the Lord to represent the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We cannot overlook the Body, and we cannot overlook the representatives of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>May the Lord grant us the revelation of the Body so that we can submit to Christ the Head as well as to the representatives of the Body.</S>
