   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PETER S MINISTRY AND THE INITIAL STAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF SAUL S MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapter one of Acts stands alone as a chapter concerned with preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then in chapter two we have the beginning of the propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapters two through five are one portion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These four chapters are concerned with Peter s propagating ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter two we have Peter s first message, given on the day of Pentecost, and then in chapter three we see the miracle done for a man lame from birth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Based upon that miracle, Peter gave another message, which is recorded in chapters three and four.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is related to what took place in chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, these four chapters form a section concerned with the propagating ministry of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts 6 begins with the appointment of seven serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Among these seven was Stephen, who was a teacher of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter seven we have a record of Stephen s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Another of the seven serving ones was Philip, who was an evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter eight gives us a record of the preaching work of this evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Stephen was persecuted and eventually put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A young man named Saul took part in that persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The case of Stephen caused the Jewish leaders to be stirred up to persecute the followers of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning this, 8:1 says, There occurred in that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Following this we are told, Saul was devastating the church 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that Saul was one of the main leaders of the persecution against the followers of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But as this leading persecutor was on the way from Jerusalem to Damascus, he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only was he saved he became a prevailing preacher, as indicated by the record in 9:20-30.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Saul s conversion and his becoming a prevailing preacher do not mark the end of Peter s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Immediately after the record of Saul s preaching, Peter comes back into the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The scene, however, is not in Judea but in a place not far from Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we have seen, this place became a stepping stone for Peter to go into the Gentile world and open the gate for the Gentiles to enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Readers of the book of Acts may find it difficult to divide this book into sections.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In our study of Acts, we may regard chapters six through eleven as a section.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this section of Acts we see that Saul s ministry in its initial stage is mingled with Peter s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But although these two ministries are mingled, Peter s ministry is still primary in these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we shall see, Saul s ministry comes in gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peter went to Joppa, which became a stepping stone to the Gentiles in Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was a preparation for the gaining of the Gentiles so that Saul, who was to become an apostle to the Gentiles, may begin his ministry to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In chapters six through eleven Peter, although his ministry is still primary, is beginning to move out of the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Also in these chapters Saul is coming into the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We first hear of Saul at the end of chapter seven where we are told that the witnesses to Stephen s stoning laid down their garments at the feet of a young man called Saul 7:58 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that when Paul came into the scene, he came in as a persecutor.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then in chapter nine this persecutor was converted into a prevailing preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Toward the end of Acts 9, Saul begins to step into his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we shall see, his ministry to the Gentile world began in a definite and prevailing way in chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By that time Peter is out of the scene, and Paul is fully in the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE LORD S SOVEREIGNTY IN HIS PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In these chapters we see the Lord s sovereignty in propagating Himself by spreading into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord spent three and a half years plus an additional period of time to prepare Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then the Lord spent another period of time to prepare Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In our reading of Acts, we need to realize that between the end of chapter nine and the beginning of chapter thirteen there is an interval.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During that interval Saul received a great deal from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, what took place is not recorded in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We only know that for a time Paul was in Arabia Gal 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have no way to find out what he did there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, we believe that during this interval Paul received a great deal more from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, when he came forth to preach in chapter thirteen, his preaching was much more inclusive than that in chapter nine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul s preaching in Acts 9 was simple and brief.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to this chapter, he emphasized Jesus as the Son of God and as the Christ; that is, he emphasized Christ s Person and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But in chapters thirteen through twenty-eight his preaching was much more inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we study Acts, we see that the Lord had His sovereign way to prepare a chosen vessel such as Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord turned this one from a leading persecutor to one who became a great blessing to the believers.</S>
