Not many Christians realize that Christ’s transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom. According to Matthew 17:1-2 with 16:28, His coming was His transfiguration, and His transfiguration was His glorification. When He was transfigured, He was glorified.</p><p>Now we must see what it means to be glorified. When Christ, who is God, became a man, His divinity was incarnated in His humanity. The God hidden within the humanity of Jesus was the very glory. For the Lord Jesus to be transfigured meant that His humanity was saturated and permeated with His divinity. We may say that His humanity was soaked with divinity. This transfiguration, which was His glorification, was equal to His coming in His kingdom.</p><p>As we await the coming of the kingdom, we must learn not to rank Moses, Elijah, or anyone else on the same level as Christ. Instead, we need to learn to experience Christ as our Moses and Elijah. He is the One imparting the law of life into us. In other words, as our present, real, subjective Moses He is regulating us from within. Moreover, He is also our present and subjective Elijah, constantly speaking for God and speaking forth God within us. We must listen to Him.</p><p>The coming of the kingdom in 16:28—17:2 was simply a miniature and a foretaste. When we get out of the sphere of the transfiguration, we face the power of darkness outside the kingdom. While we are enjoying the transfiguration on the mountaintop, others are in the valley suffering from demon possession. To deal with the power of darkness there is the need of the exercise of the authority of the heavenly King (17:18). We can exercise this authority only through prayer and fasting.</p><p>The transfiguration on the mountaintop was not the full transfiguration; Christ still had to pass through crucifixion and enter into resurrection. Hence, He unveiled His crucifixion and resurrection a second time (vv. 22-23). According to the disciples’ mistaken concept, the Christ who had been transfigured on the mountaintop did not need to be crucified. Therefore, they “were greatly grieved” at His word. No matter how excellent the experience of transfiguration might be, we still need to stay under the killing of the cross. By bearing the cross we pass through crucifixion into resurrection.</p><p>In 17:24-27 we have the matter of paying the temple tax to the poll tax gatherers. This is a test to determine whether or not we know how to apply the revelation and vision concerning Christ. On the mountain Peter talked too much, and he was rebuked for it. Now when the poll tax gatherers asked him whether or not the Lord paid the temple tax (v. 24), he still had too much to say and did not hesitate to answer. Peter had spoken presumptuously in both situations. Whatever the Lord Jesus says is always right, and whatever we propose to Him is always wrong. What we say means nothing. It is what He says that counts. The meaning of the vision on the mountaintop is that we should hear the Lord Jesus and not anyone else, including ourselves.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p>
