   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the previous chapter, we saw that we need to be those who overcome the loss of the first love by giving Christ the first place, the preeminence, in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The loss of the first love is seen with the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are four main points in the Lord's epistle to the church in Ephesus love, life, light, and the lampstand Rev 2:4-5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Love, life, and light are actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is love 1 John 4:8, 16 , God is life John 5:26; 14:6a , and God is light 1 John 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, the Divine Trinity is love, life, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father is love, the Son is life, and the Spirit is light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father is the source as love, the Son is the course as life, and the Spirit is the flow as light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Gospel of John says clearly, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men" 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the Lord said in John 8:12 that He was the light of the world and that whoever followed Him would have the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible eventually reveals that the Father is the Son Isa 9:6 , and the Son is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that love is life, and life is light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Love is the source, life is the course, and light is the shining out to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These are three aspects of one person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one, so love, life, and light are one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We enjoy the Son as the divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life, through the Spirit as light, and we touch the Father as love by the Son as life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Triune God is love as the source, life as the course, and light as the flow to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every day and even every moment we are under the shining of the light, which means that we are under the reaching of the Triune God for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we overcome to return to Christ as our first love, we will enjoy Him as life, and will shine forth the divine light as the lampstand to keep the testimony of Jesus Rev 1:9; 12:17 in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have some hints about the overcomers in Paul's writings, but only the apostle John in the book of Revelation speaks directly concerning the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have seen that the book of Revelation covers two main things the overcomers and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The overcomers issue in the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is the consummation of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The overcomers are precious stones, precious material, built together into a house, and this house is the consummation of all of the precious stones, the precious material.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The house is the consummation, the building up, of all the precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the beginning of Revelation, the Lord is calling for this precious material, for the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's calling in Revelation is not for being saved but for becoming an overcomer, a precious stone for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The overcomers are the believers of Christ transformed into precious stones for the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Revelation 2:17 every transformed believer as a white stone will bear a new name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This new name is the transformed name of a transformed person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Revelation 2 and 3, the overcomers are not yet because the Lord is calling for them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through the centuries, in the period of time from Revelation 4 20, the Lord has gained and is gaining a number of overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this age the overcoming believers must pay the price to be built up together into one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There should be oneness among the saints and among all the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Scriptures show that eventually there was no building between Paul and Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They were together for awhile, but after the conference in Jerusalem in Acts 15, there was a great split between Barnabas and Paul vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>35-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Apollos was another problem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul told the Corinthians that he had urged Apollos to come to them many times.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No doubt, the Corinthians were in desperate need, so he wanted Apollos to visit them, but Paul said, "It was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity" 1 Cor 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By this we can see that Apollos was not one with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But Paul and Timothy and Titus were one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Paul told Timothy or Titus to go, they went.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When he asked them to remain, they remained.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But between Paul and Apollos there was not such a pleasant oneness; there was a big shortage of being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, we can see that between Paul and Barnabas, there was the lack of building, and between Paul and Apollos there was also the lack of building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we consider the situation among Christians today, we will see that no one is built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone is independent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The big speakers in Christianity build up something for themselves, but who is built up with others?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To receive Christ as life for our regeneration is the initiation of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To grow in this life is the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then by this growth, we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After being transformed, we have to be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This building is the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this chapter we want to cover the three crucial points concerning the overcomers in the epistles to the church in Smyrna, the church in Pergamos, and the church in Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The epistle to the church in Ephesus covers the overcoming of the loss of the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the previous chapter, we saw the spiritual interpretation of the loss of the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To have the Lord as our first love actually means that we take our Lord as the first.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to give Him the preeminence in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In everything He is the first.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we are not making Him the first in everything, we do not have the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To have the first love is to give the preeminence, the first place, to the Lord Jesus in everything, even in all of the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the brothers buy a tie, they need to give Christ the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the sisters go shopping, they need to give Christ the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the Saturday edition of the newspaper comes out, some sisters like to read it to find all of the sales in the department stores.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To have this practice means that they do not give the Lord the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They do not let the Lord have the first place in their shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we need something, we should go to the store to get that thing and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The sisters need to overcome the temptation of the department stores.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>With the church in Ephesus, the Lord reveals that if we are going to overcome all the situations and be a real overcomer, we have to give the Lord the preeminence in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then we will be ones who enjoy the Lord as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>First, we have love, and then we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then corporately we will be the lampstand shining forth the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thus, we will have the four "l's" love, life, light, and the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the revelation in the first epistle, which is to the church in Ephesus.</S>
