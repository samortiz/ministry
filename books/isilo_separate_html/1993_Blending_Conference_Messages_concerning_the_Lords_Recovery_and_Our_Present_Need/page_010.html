God exalted Him to His right hand (Acts 2:33; 5:31). He has the highest place in the universe because He is seated at the right hand of God. He is Head over all things (Eph. 1:22b), and He has the name above every name (Phil. 2:9). Even the calendar that people use today is the calendar of Christ. History tells us that if you are under the calendar of a certain king, you are under the rule and reign of that king. The year is 1993. The earth has not been in existence for only nineteen hundred ninety-three years, but it has been in the status of the all-inclusive Christ for only nineteen hundred ninety-three years. That means that everyone on this earth unconsciously admits that Jesus Christ is the King of kings, the Lord of lords, and the preeminent Ruler of the entire earth.</P><P>He also has the preeminence in the church, which is His Body, because He is the Head of the Body, the church (Col. 1:18a). Christ has the preeminence in the created universe and in the new creation, the church. If we are going to be vital, living and active, overcomers to carry out the Lord's recovery, we have to give Him the preeminence. We have to give Him the place He deserves. The degradation of the church always comes in when we do not give Christ the first place. We have to give Him the first place in our family life, in our church life, in our business life, in our social life, and in all the meetings of the church. He must have the first place in everything.</P><P>To give Him the first place is to love Him with the first love, the best love (Rev. 2:4). To have the first love for the Lord is to give Him the preeminence in all things, in great things and in small things. When we buy a tie, when we get our hair cut, when we do everything, we have to give Him the preeminence, the first place. Those who give Christ the preeminence are the overcomers to carry out the Lord's recovery to rescue the church from its degradation.</P><P>The all-inclusive Christ is also the One who fills all in all. He fills the entire universe. He is not only all-inclusive but also all-extensive. He fills all things in all things. Ephesians 4:10 shows us how He fills all in all. He had a universal traffic. He descended and He ascended that He might fill all things. This descending and ascending describes the entire process through which He passed. He descended from the heavens to the earth in incarnation. He descended further in His death to the lower parts of the earth in Hades. Then He resurrected to ascend from Hades to the earth. Then He ascended further from the earth to the third heaven. By His universal traffic from His incarnation through His ascension, in His descension and His ascension, He filled the entire universe. The Christ we have living in us is the One who fills the entire universe.</P><P>In Ephesians 3:18 Paul said that we might know what the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth are. How broad is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, and how deep is the depth? These are the universal dimensions of Christ. His dimensions are the dimensions of the universe. This means that Christ is our universe. He is the all-inclusive One and the all-extensive One in God's New Testament economy. All these points just make you want to say, "Lord Jesus, I love You. I want to give You the preeminence."</P><P>Not only does Christ fill all in all, but also He is the centrality and universality of God's economy. God's New Testament economy is like a great wheel with a hub, with spokes, and with a rim. Ezekiel 1:15 speaks of this great wheel. Christ is the hub of this wheel, the spokes of this wheel, and the rim of this wheel. Thus, we can enjoy Him as our wheel to move in Him, with Him, by Him, and through Him in oneness with Him to carry out His move for His eternal economy.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
