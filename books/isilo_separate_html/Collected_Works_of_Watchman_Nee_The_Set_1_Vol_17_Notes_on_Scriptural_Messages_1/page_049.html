Humanly speaking and as far as our relationship in the Lord is concerned, there is still no distinction between them and us. We have no opinions or prejudice against those in the denominations. In our meetings there are visitors from the denominations, both Chinese and Westerners. Moreover, we left not because of Mr. Nee's words but because we were led by God's Word.</P><P>Here, we have much opportunity to hear about the inner leading of the Holy Spirit. But for us, in addition to hearing about it, we have the experience of seeing the Holy Spirit working within us and teaching us directly in our intuition. Sometimes we do not understand such leadings and are weak, but He is within us and teaching us all things. This is the word of 1 John 2:27. I used to think that the Holy Spirit gave us feelings from outside. Since the conference, however, I realize that the Holy Spirit works within us. All we have to do is to go along with the inner leading. If the Holy Spirit has not given us any leading, we should not move rashly. At that time, I only knew that this teaching was right, but today I am allowing the Holy Spirit to work in me day by day. Our leaving the denomination and all the works we did after we left were the works of the Holy Spirit within us. It would be dangerous if we trusted in our own work. Of course, we were not without mistakes during the past few years. If there were any mistakes, we ask for the cleansing and forgiveness of the Lord's blood. Everything that remains is the result of the Lord's work within us. Everything that is initiated by the Holy Spirit will remain until that day.</P><P>The help we have received came from the book The Spiritual Man. The book did not teach us some outward teachings; every point in it can be experienced. Some among us had already experienced something similar to what is described in the book. Whatever little work that we can testify for the Lord today is the result of the Holy Spirit's work within us; nothing comes out of our imagination, arrangement, or method.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Concerning Spiritual Warfare</H2><P>Spiritual warfare is not a knowledge. During the past few years, the devil has been attacking us directly. We experienced the spiritual warfare. It is not a teaching but a tangible warfare. The teaching concerning the devil is real. Sometimes the devil would attack us directly, and sometimes he would attack us indirectly. Sometimes he would attack the church, and sometimes, individuals. At times we were in darkness, but the book The Spiritual Man helped us. The teaching in that book reminded us that what is inside of us is greater than what is in the world. Every time that we fight with the devil and are about to be defeated, we are reminded of the words of the book that we will win as long as we stand. When we do this, we overcome. I remember Mr. Nee once said that when our works are attacked by the enemy, it proves that the enemy is sensing his defeat. The times when we feel most troubled is the very time when the devil is defeated. Indeed, many times, when we do not have any way to go on, a way is opened; many times when we do not have the light, light comes from somewhere. The Lord has indeed helped us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Concerning the Church</H2><P>We experienced no difficulty within the past few years. The church is not established by man or erected through donations. Formerly, churches were raised up through men's donations; they were established by men, mostly foreigners. Now there is hope with the churches in China. For example, after Brother Wu left his denomination in Yi-lin, he did not leave the Lord; instead, he offered his house to the Lord for the use of meeting. The meeting in Su Chia-chui also experiences no difficulty. In addition, in the rural areas the Lord has raised up responsible ones. For example, in Chan-chia-shue-tse, there is now a meeting raised up. They are much advanced spiritually. Although they have only twenty or more people, there is no difficulty among them. One brother by the name of Chan voluntarily came to me and asked to start the breaking of bread meeting in his home. He said that the Lord convicted them that they should meet together. When I heard the conviction in his voice, I realized that the matter was of the Lord. Chan-chia-shue-tse is fifteen miles away from Su Chia-chui. Some brothers who live in another place seven miles from Chan-chia-shue-tse also wanted to have the Lord's table. The Lord's table at Chan-chia-shue-tse was very suitable because it was centrally located. For that reason, I agreed that they should go ahead and have the meeting.</P><P>Do you know what kind of a person Mr. Chan was? He was an illiterate person. He could not read but was quite wealthy. The produce from his fifteen acres of land was enough to support his whole family year round. Yet he stood for the Lord and began to have meetings in his home. Every Lord's Day, he and his wife cleaned up the table and opened up three rooms in his house for the Lord's table meeting. He could not read at first, but during the past two years, he began to read the Bible and sing hymns. On the Lord's Day he even stood up to give messages. He is indeed the messenger of that local church. This really touched us. Although they have not visited other places and although they do not have any organization, the Lord is among them.</P><P>Once we had a seven-day conference in Su Chia-chui. After the meeting he told me that he wanted to have a seven-day Bible study in his locality and the dates were set. I said, "If you wanted us to take care of the meeting, you should have waited until we were clear before you set the date." He told us that they were going to meet on their own and were not inviting us to speak. I asked if he had the burden. He said that he felt he did. I was afraid that he would not be able to bear it, yet I was afraid to stop him, so I said, "Since you have the burden, go ahead and do it." By the time the Bible study came, I went to visit them. I saw him standing up to teach the Bible, and those who heard him were helped by him. I was deeply touched. After two days, I had to go to another place for some other business and did not stay until the end of that conference. However, I do feel that as long as something is of the Lord, He will raise up the right people. As long as one or two people are willing to consecrate to the Lord, He will use them. The Lord's church has no difficulty. We do not have to spend money to hire a preacher.</P><P>The condition among us is indeed like that of the church in Philadelphia in Revelation 3. When I left the denomination, I was afraid of two things:</P><P>(1) I was afraid that no one would come to meet with us. But the Lord showed me one verse, "I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut" (Rev. 3:8). Different denominations have invited us to work in their places. When they saw what we were doing, they searched the Scriptures and felt that what we were doing was right. Their conscience could not oppose us. They admitted that their practices were different from the principles in the Bible. They had nothing to say against us.</P><P>(2) I was afraid to take the way of faith. I was hired by the denomination to be a preacher, but I had difficulty sustaining myself even when I took up other jobs in addition to my preaching. When I left my denomination, I was five hundred dollars in debt. I thought that when I left the denomination, I would be left penniless. But the Lord was working in me. I had to obey and leave the denomination. Although the future was unclear then, in the end there was the light. Now, not only have I repaid the five hundred dollars, but I have experienced no lack at all.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. MR. NEE'S COMMENTS</H2><P>We do not formulate our own ideas or our own ways concerning the question of the church. Our purpose is not to set up a new denomination. Our only purpose is to meet under the name of Christ and not under the name of a place, person, or method. We are not Presbyterian which is under an office of the presbytery. We are not Congregationalist which is under the name of a method. We are not Wesleyans or Lutherans which are under the names of persons. We are not the China Inland Mission which is under the name of a place. We are not Baptists which is under the name of a ritual. We do not want to put the Lord's name under any person's name. We are jealous that the Lord's name not be put under any other name.</P><P>We do not have a denomination, and we do not have a membership list. We do not belong to the "Church of Hardoon Road," and we are not a member of it. We are meeting under the name of Christ, and no one can be separated from Christ.</P><P>Many people think that those who preach in Shanghai can live by God, while those who preach in the rural countryside cannot live by God, and that they will die of starvation if they try. I also live by God. Allow me to say an honest word-this is not to shame you-if I had to live by the believers in Shanghai, I would have died long ago. I do not live by the believers in Shanghai, but I live very much by the believers in the countryside whom God has used. The amount the believers in Shanghai have supported me with is only one-tenth of my monthly expenses. Our Sister Wang and Sister Liu came back from Kiangsu and told us that they offered beyond their ability. This is not only true with Kiangsu. The Lord has raised up over thirty meetings that meet under His name in Pingyang and southern Fukien. According to my knowledge, there are now over sixty people in China who are living by God. Brother Chi had a debt of five hundred dollars. He is not only clear of his debt now, but he is not living in any want. God gives the Spirit without measure to those who will obey Him (John 3:34). The Lord has worked through them to help and save many people. Even their enemies are turned into friends. Members of the local denomination in Yi-lin as well as the preacher tried to hand over their chapel to Mr. Wu. The preacher was willing to resign. This shows us the effect of the work. Brother Wu and Brother Chi occupied important positions in the denomination. Brother Wu was an elder there, and Brother Chi was a preacher. But they obeyed God. God will commit His work to those who obey Him. Even I am encouraged by them and stirred up to become zealous.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> </body></html>
