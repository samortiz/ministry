GOD&#8217;S MASTERPIECE</h2><p>[Ephesians 2:10 says, &#8220;For we are His workmanship.&#8217;&#8217; The Greek word for workmanship, poiema, can also be translated masterpiece or poem. It conveys the thought of a piece of work that expresses its maker or author. The church is a poem! In the whole universe the church stands out as an expression of God&#8217;s wisdom; its design cannot be improved upon. It is like pleasant music or a lovely poem. What a matchless display of divine wisdom! Who can improve on this supreme handiwork of God!<p>When it comes to the way a building is designed, there can always be changes and improvements. An architect often modifies his designs, as he becomes aware of their shortcomings. But what God designs has no room for improvement. Man cannot imitate it. Any adjustment would be for the worse. Consider the way the human body was designed. What a work of art the facial pattern alone is! The placement of our two eyes, our two ears, our nose, and our lips makes a beautiful appearance. Our body with two shoulders, two lovely hands, and so forth, is worthy of admiration. The church is a far greater, more magnificent design than the human body! The church is a poem declaring and demonstrating God&#8217;s wisdom and design.]<p>[God has made many things, but none of them is as dear, precious, valuable, and desirable as the church. The church is God&#8217;s masterpiece. Writers, composers, and artists often attempt to achieve a masterpiece, an outstanding work. God created the heavens and the earth, but neither the heavens nor the earth is God&#8217;s masterpiece. Likewise, God created man, but not even man is God&#8217;s masterpiece. Only one item of God&#8217;s work in this universe is His masterpiece, and this masterpiece is the church. As God&#8217;s masterpiece, the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. What could be a greater work than this? Furthermore, the church as God&#8217;s masterpiece is the corporate and universal new man (2:15). Because we see things from the side of the messed-up &#8220;kitchen&#8217;&#8217; of the church life, we may not realize that the church is such a masterpiece.]<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 5: The Church-The Vision and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
