   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TOUCHING AND NOT PRESSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I love the story about Jesus once walking down a road.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people were gathered around Him, hoping to see the resurrection of a dead person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was so crowded that the people pressed upon each other.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One woman, who suffered from an issue of blood for years, thought that Jesus would surely be able to heal her since He had performed all kinds of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She did not come to the Lord directly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All that she did was touch the fringe of His garment, and the sickness was immediately healed Mark 5:25-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jesus felt something, turned around, and asked, "Who touched Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How did the disciples respond?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They said, "You see the crowd pressing upon You and You say, Who touched Me?" v. 31 . He should have asked, "Who pressed Me?" instead of "Who touched Me?" If I were Jesus, I would have said in a gentlemanly fashion, "Excuse me." But Jesus did not need to say that.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He said that it was a touch, He meant that it was a touch and not a pressing against.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The disciples only knew that many thronged around Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But He knew that someone "touched" Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He knew what He was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There was no need for apology.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He knows no sin because He is without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>PASSED THROUGH THEIR MIDST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let me mention another story about Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One day He came to the synagogue in His hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Someone handed Him the Scripture, and He started to read from a passage about Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The people there, however, despised Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He remarked that a prophet is always despised in His own place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, God would not choose them but would rather go to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After they heard this, they were very indignant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They carried Him outside and tried to throw Him down a cliff.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I like very much what Jesus did then.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He passed through their midst Luke 4:16-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If someone tried to push us over a cliff, we would struggle to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But He was no ordinary person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He simply passed through the persecutors' midst.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They could do nothing except let Him pass by!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Again, you see the same Jesus preaching to a ruler at midnight in a house John 3:2 , while choosing to converse with a woman beside a well at midday 4:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everything He did was very proper.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one can say anything against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You cannot find fault in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>NEVER DOING A WRONG THING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another time some opposers came to tempt Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They asked whether or not it was lawful to pay tax to Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Jewish nation, as you know, no longer existed then, and Caesar of Rome was their king.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If Jesus said "no" to the question, He would have been involved in a political issue, and the opposers would have had an excuse to condemn Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If He said "yes," all the Jews would have counted Him as siding with the Romans and hated Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The result, of course, would have favored the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was a question that could not be answered "yes" or "no."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How did Jesus reply?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He said, "Show Me the coin for the tribute" Matt 22:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was wise.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He even had the opposing ones draw out the money from their own pockets.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then He asked, "Whose is this image and inscription?" v. 20 . They had to admit that it was Caesar's. Jesus gave an excellent reply: "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God" v. 21 . With that He dismissed the whole case.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is where His majesty lies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He never made a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You cannot get a case out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>CALMNESS AND MAJESTY</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I cannot enumerate all His deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everything He did bears such a mark of nobility that there is absolutely no flaw in His behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I will briefly mention His betrayal as a final example.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was very late in the night, and men armed with torches, spears, and swords came to arrest this empty-handed Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He asked them, "Whom do you seek?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They said, "Jesus the Nazarene" John 18:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He replied, "I told you that I am" v. 8 . At that very word, the band of rogues whose minds were set on capturing Him fell back to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If Jesus had not voluntarily given Himself over to them, they would never have been able to seize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Such calmness and majesty can only be seen in Him!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As to the traitor, Jesus knew from the first day of his intention.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet He allowed the same to follow Him and even let him be the keeper of the money.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All the time Jesus knew that money was being stolen by him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Who can demonstrate such forbearance and uprightness?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Here is a man who is absolutely different from all others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In every respect, He has been proven to be the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>PERFORMED IMPOSSIBLE ACTS</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The fourth qualification we mentioned is that one who claims to be God incarnated must be able to perform what an ordinary person cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Has Jesus of Nazareth performed any supernatural acts?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are not His contemporaries; it was almost two thousand years ago that He walked on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Naturally, we cannot be His witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But one thing is sure: the apostles who followed Jesus recorded, preached, and testified the things concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The four Gospels were all completed within thirty years after His departure.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Most of the Jews who were then alive had seen Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the apostles' records were false, they would have been repudiated long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, the Jews only argued that Jesus is not the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They never denied His deeds, for the deeds were all facts.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today, when we read the four Gospels, we have no apprehension about their authenticity.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If there had been a slight error when they were written, there would have been grave problems because many of the contemporaries had actually seen and heard Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There was no chance for any fabrication.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hence, these books cannot be a hoax.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If the Jews could not attack these books, there is even less of a basis for an attack today.</S>
