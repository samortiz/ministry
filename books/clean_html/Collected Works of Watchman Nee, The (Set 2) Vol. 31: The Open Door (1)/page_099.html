Brother Si Meng-yu, Brother Chang Ming-jing, and I have moved from Li-Shui, Chekiang to Ji-An, Kiangsi. There are seven or eight brothers with the sisters in their families, so we can still meet and have the table. Brother Ma Ti-sheng and Brother Chen Yi-liang are in Li-Shui. Brother Ruan Chi-yu and Brother Lee Kwei-sien are in Hangchow. The region of Chou-Jia-Pu was burned to the ground. The brothers and sisters there need our petitions. Please send us a letter telling us about the brothers who are living in Nan-ch'ang and Ch'ang-sha. (Brother Yu Nan-geng is in Nan-ch'ang; see Issue No. 5 of this publication. In Ch'ang-sha, you can go to the Faith Orphanage, 12 Huo Yao Chu Street to find Brother Liu Ai-wu&mdash;Editor.) Please send us three copies of The Open Door.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chiu Chung-man<br />March 17<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">News of the Brothers and Sisters<br />in Soochow</h2><p>Most of the brothers and sisters in Soochow left the city when the war began on August 13. Just a small number remained in the city. On November 9 and 11 of last year, it seemed as if there was a continuous air raid alarm from morning to night. Thank the Lord, the bombs did not come near us. The brothers and sisters who were in the city took a boat and left for another place on the fifteenth of November. In our group there were Brother Jin Fang-lien and his family, Brother Chin Yao-ching and his family, Brother Lu Tze-shing and his family, and Sister Wei Siang-yun, for a total of about thirty people. We were divided into two boats that were going to Wusih together. We met with great danger along the way. Brother Jin's boat was destroyed by a bomb, but thank the Lord, the lives of his whole family were preserved. After this we separated. Brother Jin and the others traveled for fifty days and arrived safely in Shanghai on January 10. We continued ahead and have been living in the countryside around Wusih for three months. Thank the Lord for His grace. Brother Chin Yao-ching and his entire family have now returned to Soochow. Brother Lu Tze-shing and Sister Wei Siang-yun arrived safely in Shanghai on February 18. As I look back on the past months, I have to thank the Lord for His great grace in enabling us to safely pass through all kinds of hardships and dangers on the road, both in our environment and in our living. We only have news from the brothers and sisters who left before November 11. After November 11, with the exception of Mrs. Chui and Mrs. Chai, whose families had safely arrived in Shanghai, we have not heard anything from the rest. We heard that Brother Shen Guan-min and his family are in Lan-Si, Chekiang, and that they met up with bandits. (This is Brother Lu Tze-shing's oral testimony after arriving in Shanghai. We thank God for it, but we also hope to hear news from the rest of the brothers and sisters&mdash;Editor.)</p>
