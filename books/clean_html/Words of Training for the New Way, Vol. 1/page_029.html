<h1 class="title">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BEING FILLED<br />
IN THE SPIRIT WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:18-19; John 3:6; 4:24; Rom. 8:16; 12:11; 2 Tim. 4:22; Matt. 10:32; John 17:21</h1>
<p>In the preceding message, I presented to you the matter of being filled in the spirit with the Triune God. This is not a small matter. This is the key to our experience and enjoyment of Christ. The central point of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is that this processed Triune God has become the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit and come into us to mingle as one with the tripartite man. He is our life, and we are His living. This living is a living of being filled in our spirit with the Triune God. The entire New Testament takes this as the key, as the secret, as far as the revelation of our experience of the Lord is concerned.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING SENT BY THE TRIUNE GOD,<br />
FILLED WITH THE TRIUNE GOD,<br />
AND GOING OUT TO KNOCK ON DOORS<br />
WITH THE TRIUNE GOD FOR GOSPEL PREACHING</h2>
<p>Your going out to visit homes to contact people, bring them to salvation, dispense Christ into them, and baptize them into the Triune God who is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is a great matter that shakes heaven and earth. This is not a superstitious performance, but a real fact. This matter is too marvelous and too wonderful! I am afraid that even those of us who have knocked on doors to preach the gospel for a long time do not have a thorough realization regarding the matter of bringing people to believe in the Lord and baptizing them into the Triune God. If we had a thorough realization, we would feel that we have absolutely no way to carry out this matter by ourselves. We can do it because the Triune God is within us, filling us, and mingling with us as one.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you go to knock on doors to preach the gospel, it is not only you who are going, but the Triune God going together with you. You may say that you bring the Triune God with you to knock on doors to preach the gospel; or you may also say that the Triune God brings you with Him to knock on doors to preach the gospel. If you are clear concerning this vision, your hand will not be trembling when you knock on the doors. When someone opens the door, it is not necessary to say the same thing every time, &ldquo;I am sent by such-and-such church.&rdquo; You may say, &ldquo;The Triune God and I are coming to visit you.&rdquo; You may also say, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus Christ wants me to come with Him to visit you.&rdquo; You may even speak in this way, &ldquo;The ever-living God has brought me here today to visit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Matthew 10:19-20, the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;But when they deliver you up...it shall be given to you in that hour what you shall speak; for you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.&rdquo; I have definitely experienced what the Lord promised here. When the Japanese were invading China, I was taken away by the Japanese twice when I was in the enemy-occupied area. One time I was confined day and night for thirty days, and was interrogated twice a day for two to three hours each time. I definitely had the experience of answering questions before the so-called government officials. I can testify that the Lord was really with me and was within me helping me to speak. One day, they brought me out of the prison and asked me, &ldquo;You had revival meetings. What is the meaning of revival meetings?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Christianity always has &lsquo;stirring-up&rsquo; meetings. The terms we use for all the activities in our church, however, must be scriptural. In the Bible, you cannot find such a term as &lsquo;stirring up,&rsquo; but rather the term &lsquo;revival&rsquo; is used.&rdquo; He then asked me, &ldquo;Where does the Bible say revival?&rdquo; I immediately replied, &ldquo;Habakkuk chapter three.&rdquo; He tossed the Bible to me and said, &ldquo;Show it to me!&rdquo; The Bible has sixty-six books with more than a thousand pages. But that day I randomly opened it right to the page of Habakkuk chapter three. Further, I pointed with my finger right to the word revive! &ldquo;O Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years&rdquo; (v. 2). When that official who was questioning me saw this happen, he became quiet for a period of time and was subdued. He did not know how to question me further. I believe he must have realized that there was something special with me.</p>
<p>We who go out to knock on doors to preach the gospel need to have this vision. We need to see that not only does the Triune God send me, but He also fills me and mingles with me, and that I and He, He and I, are one. When the sisters go out to knock on doors to preach the gospel, more or less they have some fear. You need to realize, however, that it is not you alone who are going, but the Triune God who has mingled Himself with you is going with you. When someone opens his door, you should say boldly, &ldquo;The Triune God has sent me to bring Him along with me to visit you.&rdquo; Even though he may not understand, he can realize that there is something special coming out of you. This is like that woman with the issue of blood who touched the garment of the Lord Jesus; the Lord felt power going out of Him (Mark 5:30). You and I should have such a faith. When we go out to knock on doors to preach the gospel, once our mouths are opened and the word has gone out, power will be passed on to others from us. This is the genuine preaching of the gospel by knocking on doors.</p>
