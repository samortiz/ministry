<p>Jude was surely a brother under God&rsquo;s dispensing. In Jude there is the matter of building up ourselves in the most holy faith (v. 20). What is faith? It is just the impartation of Christ into us. This is our faith. We all have to be built up in this faith. This is to be built up in the divine life dispensing. Then we can pray in the Holy Spirit and keep ourselves in the love of God as we await the mercy of our Lord (v. 20b-21). Here is the Trinity of the Godhead: the Holy Spirit, God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ. In the holy faith we have the Trinity for our enjoyment. This enjoyment of the Trinity is just to partake of the divine dispensing of life. Eventually this is unto eternal life and will set us before His glory without blemish in exultation (v. 24). To be built up in the faith, to pray in the Holy Spirit, to keep ourselves in the love of God, to await the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, is altogether unto eternal life so that we may be set before God&rsquo;s glory. This indicates clearly that to get involved with the Trinity is to enjoy the dispensing of life which results unto eternal life and the divine glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE MINISTRY OF JAMES</h2>
<p>James also has a few good points. He said that every good and perfect gift comes from the Father of lights (1:17). He also said that the Father of lights is the One who begot us by the Word of truth (v. 18) according to His own will that we should be a kind of firstfruit of His creatures. The firstfruit is surely something of life. Among all the creatures we believers are the first ones to receive and enjoy divine life. Because God has begotten us and we have the eternal life, we are the firstfruits of life among all the created items. We have to respect and thank James because he told us something about God&rsquo;s life dispensing. To beget is to dispense life. When our human father begot us, he dispensed his life into us. When the Father of lights begot us, He dispensed His life into our being to make us a kind of firstfruit among His creatures. This is the begetting for life dispensing.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
