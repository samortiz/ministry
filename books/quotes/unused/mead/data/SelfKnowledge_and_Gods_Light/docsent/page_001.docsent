   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND GOD'S LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today, I believe that God wants me to give a message on how to know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A Christian never progresses in spirituality if he does not know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And a Christian can never spiritually progress further than what he knows.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whatever light not knowledge he receives, he expresses life to that degree.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No Christian can progress further than the light which God has given him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a Christian does not know his faults or his real condition, he will not pursue after what is new or go on in the way ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The most important thing in a Christian's life is to judge himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He must consider his own flesh as not trustworthy and himself as absolutely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only in this way will he utterly trust God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And only then can he walk according to the Holy Spirit and not according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without self-judgment, spiritual living is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have already spoken on this matter in another place; therefore, I shall not expand on it here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If one does not know himself, he will not judge himself and he will not have the spiritual blessings that come from self-judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God wants us to know how corrupt and how unable our flesh is to satisfy His demand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we do not know this, we fail to have the living which is purely in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Unconsciously we are filled with a heart of self-approval and self-confidence because of the shortage of self-knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We consider ourselves trustworthy and fail to understand the meaning of the Lord's word, "Apart from Me you can do nothing" John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the Holy Spirit is given to help our weaknesses, ignorance of our own weaknesses blinds us from looking for His help, and so we remain weak.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not know ourselves, we will not only be self-confident and self-approving, but we will also be full of self-content, thinking marvelously of ourselves and being full of a pride that is most displeasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because we do not know ourselves, our daily living will have many shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will have no feeling about unfulfilled duties, unrighteousnesses toward others, instances of lack of love, and instances of being angry, anxious, and unmerciful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the situation gets worse and worse, we feel at ease and content.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because we do not know ourselves, we do not know how great is our lack and how complete and precious is the salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result we miss so many spiritual blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Self-knowledge is the first condition toward betterment, because only those who know themselves desire for the better yes, even God's best.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who do not know themselves will not have a hungry and thirsty heart, and they will not have the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Self-knowledge is absolutely indispensable to a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IS SELF-KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>DERIVED FROM SELF-EXAMINATION?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How do worldly people know their mistakes?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They know by the method of introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They examine their own deeds and think back on their past.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They "turn inward" to examine their motives and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Introspection is commonly described as self-examination and evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If worldly people do not examine themselves, they have no way of knowing themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I often hear many Christians say that they must examine themselves to see if they have committed any mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But let me tell you: self-examination is not the duty of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Self-examination is a big deception; many Christians are damaged by self-examination.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to ask, 1 Does the Bible teach self-examination?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2 Can self-examination enable us to know ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>3 Is self-examination profitable?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From these we will prove that self-examination is really not the duty of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Does the Bible Teach</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Self-examination?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Does the Bible command Christians to examine themselves?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Griffith Thomas said that in the whole Bible there are only two places which mention self- examination, but both refer to something specific.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let us look at these two instances.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"But let a man prove himself, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup" 1 Cor 11:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The proving in this verse is not an examination which Christians have in the pursuit of holiness; rather, it speaks of coming before the Lord to eat the bread and drink the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should examine ourselves to see if we confess that the bread and the cup are the Lord's body and the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eating the bread and drinking the cup is a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we must examine ourselves to see if we remember its spiritual significance; otherwise, it will become a ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Self-examination in this verse concerns whether or not we come to the Lord's table to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It does not ask us to turn inward to search for wrongs so that we can pursue after spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves" 2 Cor 13:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This verse, even more than the first, does not tell us to examine our inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This portion indicates something specific.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At that time in Corinth, there were many who slandered Paul by saying that Paul was not an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore Paul asked them, "Examine yourselves, whether you have faith or not.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you have faith, then that is the proof of my being an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If God had not called me to be the apostle to the Gentiles, then how could you be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God called me to preach the gospel to you, Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Your salvation proves that I am a true apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you have no faith, then I am a false apostle."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The self-examination mentioned here is not a self-examination during our pursuit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Rather, it is a particular case of a particular condition existing in Corinth a self-examination of whether or not there was faith.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the Old Testament in the Chinese Bible, there is at least one more place which mentions examining oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>"Examine your ways" Hag 1:5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>First, please take notice that it does not say that you must consider yourselves; rather, it says that you must examine your ways.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is outward.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Second, the word examine in the original language means "to consider."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It says that you must consider your outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It does not say that you should examine your inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we read the context of the three portions mentioned above, we should realize that they are not talking about introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Rather, they talk about the examination of a particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, we have the confidence to conclude that the Bible does not teach Christians to examine themselves.</S>
