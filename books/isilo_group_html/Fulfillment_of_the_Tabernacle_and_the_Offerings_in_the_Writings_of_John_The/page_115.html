Here in chapter twelve we see a particular extract. This extract is that as the result of the nine cases in which we see Christ as the offerings, there is a house of feasting in Bethany. This house is composed of those who have been regenerated, freed from sin, healed of their blindness, and resurrected from death. Therefore, the result of Christ being the offerings is a household where His disciples may feast with Him as the incarnated God.<p>To be sure, the church life pictured by the house in Bethany was on a very small scale. Probably not more than twenty people were feasting together in the house. But although the scale was small, the reality was profound.<h2 class=head2>A Picture of the Church Life</h2><p>In this house in Bethany we have a miniature of the church life. Here we have a picture of the church life and also of the church meeting. Yes, the scale in John 12 is small, but the picture is perfect, complete. What is the church life according to the portrait in John 12? The church life is a life where some are serving the Lord, some are expressing their love for the Lord, and some are doing nothing except testifying of resurrection life. According to this picture, everyone is feasting with the Lord. This is the church life.<p>We have pointed out that while the Lord and the disciples were feasting in Bethany, the priests were worshipping God in a formal, religious way in the temple. The service in Bethany was on a small scale, but the religious worship in Jerusalem was on a grand scale. If you had been there at the time, where would you have gone to worship God? Would you have gone to the house in Bethany or to the temple in Jerusalem? I believe that, if we are honest, we shall admit that we would have gone to the temple in Jerusalem for the worship of God. In that house in Bethany there were no priests, and there was neither the altar with the offering of sacrifices nor the incense altar. Nevertheless, God was in that home in Bethany.<p>Because they had the Lord Jesus Himself with them, Lazarus, Martha, and Mary certainly would not have left Him to go to worship in the temple. They had been attracted by the Lord Jesus; He was a strong magnet drawing them to Himself. Who was this Jesus to whom they were attracted? He was the very God incarnate, that is, God in the flesh, God in humanity. This incarnated God was enjoying Himself with His disciples there in Bethany, and His disciples were enjoying Him with God and with one another. Together they were having a marvelous enjoyment. This is a picture of the church life.<p>In the miniature of the church life portrayed in John 12, we see three matters: serving, loving, and testifying. This miniature of the church life with these aspects is the issue of the Lord as the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering. Because the Lord is the reality of all these offerings, in John 12 we have Him as the peace offering. Let us, therefore, enjoy Him as the qualified One and as the One who satisfies both God and us.<p>I believe that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, no time was more pleasant to Him than that time of feasting in the house with Lazarus, Martha, and Mary and the others in Bethany. When He saw Lazarus testifying, Mary loving, and Martha serving, He was satisfied. In that He enjoyed a most pleasant time. This, then, is the first sign in John 12-a sign that portrays the church life in miniature.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_114.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_116.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 115</div><br></body></html>
