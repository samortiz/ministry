<p class="bold">WEEK 7 — DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">Rom. 12:1 &nbsp;…Present your bodies a living sacrifice… which is your reasonable service.</p><p class="bold">5 &nbsp;So we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.</p><p class="bold">7 &nbsp;Or service, let us be faithful in that service…</p><p class="bold">11 &nbsp;…Be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">Only a Heavenly Vision of the Body Being Able to Bring Us into the Genuine Service of the Lord</h2><p>God’s intention in the whole universe is to gain a Body for Christ.…When we come to the matter of serving the Lord, we all need to be very clear that we need the Body, and we need a heavenly vision concerning the Body. May the Lord grant us all such a vision that will bring us into a full realization that we need to be in the reality of the Body, even that we cannot serve without the Body, and, in fact, that we cannot live, we cannot exist spiritually in life, outside the Body. Only by such a heavenly vision of the Body can we be brought into the genuine service of the Lord.</p><p>Strictly speaking, in the New Testament the service is not touched clearly and definitely until Romans 12. In this chapter both the words service and serving are used. In Romans 12:1 Paul exhorts us to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is our most reasonable service. In verse 7 he mentions the service, and in verse 11 he speaks of serving the Lord as a slave. It is not until Romans 12 that the matter of service is so definitely revealed to us. From this chapter we can realize that, as Christians, our service to the Lord must be in the Body. The Christian service is not something individual; it is something corporate. The Christian service is something of the Body, in the Body, with the Body, and for the Body.<sup>189</sup></p><h2 class="head1">Service in the Body</h2><p>Every believer is a member of the Body, a part of the Body. An individual is not the Body. A member of the Body cannot function without the Body. The hand is good, quite useful, but if it is cut off from the body, it becomes not only dead, but also ugly, terrible, and even terrifying.…Today many Christians are detached, separated from the reality of the Body. It is as if they are disembodied members.… How could they serve the Lord? How could we serve the Lord without being built up together as members of the Body? It is impossible.…But if we do have a sincere heart to serve the Lord, we need to realize that the service is in the Body.<sup>190</sup></p><p>What does being a member mean? It means that all of our work and living are based on the Body; the Body is the unit of operation. When my hands work, it is not my hands that are working, but my body that is working. When my feet walk, it is not my feet that are walking, but my body that is walking. Every move of the members has the Body as its unit of operation. What one member does is what the whole Body does.…Nothing that the members do is for themselves. Everything that the members do is for the Body. Every move of the members is based on the Body, not on the members. We are happy if God puts us in the first place, and equally happy even if He puts us in the last place. Only the ones who do not see the Body can be proud, and only they can be jealous of others.</p><p>The meaning of serving the Body of Christ is to receive life from the Head for the supply of the Body. It is to transmit the life that is in the Head to the church. When the eyes see, the body sees. The eyes supply the body with their seeing; this is what it means to serve as members. The hands cannot detect the smell of an object; it takes the nose to serve the body with its smelling function. Smell is the specific ministry of the nose. The ears serve the body with their hearing. Hearing is the specific ministry of the ears. The result of the work of every ministry is the growth of the stature of the Body. In other words, it is the Body gaining more of Christ. The ministry of the members is the ministry of Christ to the church; it is to dispense Christ to others.<sup>191</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
