   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How about us in the Lord's recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We tried our best to leave Christianity, but Christianity would not give us up.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We tried the best to leave the practice of Christianity, but the practice of Christianity still follows us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The practice of Christianity is still in our blood, still in our bones, still in the marrow of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do you like to go to a big meeting in a big hall with a good facade where thousands are sitting together with a good, eloquent speaker?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Or do you like to go to a little home with seven or eight meeting there with no good speaker?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What kind of meeting do you prefer the big meeting with the facade, or the small meeting in the little home?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are all the same in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We like to go to big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the big meetings with only one speaker and a passive audience have killed the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our meetings there may not be much livingness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not have a proper "noise" in the Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There should be a proper noise where everyone speaks, everyone prays, everyone praises, and everyone gives thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why do we come to the meetings so silent?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Outside of the hall, we were not that silent, but when we got to the door and walked in the hall, we became silent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We learned this from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Psalms tell us to make a joyful noise unto the Lord 66:1; 81:1; 95:1-2; 98:4, 6; 100:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why would we not walk into the door and say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I'm so happy this morning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I'm enjoying the Lord and the Lord is with me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Don't you know, brother, that Christ is in me?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why would we not clap our hands Psa 47:1 ?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes we should even dance before the Lord Psa 149:3; 2 Sam 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not mean that we should be outwardly excited in a natural way like many of those in Pentecostalism, but we Christians are living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have all been made alive, and we have a living One within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are dealing with a living One, praising a living One, thanking a living One, and walking together with a living One.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why should we be so silent?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you know how much Christianity has been constituted into your Christian being?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our Christian style of worship and of practicing the church life was not built by the Spirit according to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It has been constituted with Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even before one has become a Christian, he has received a certain concept concerning how to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to many people's concept, to be a Christian is to "go to church" on Sundays at 11 o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Also the church must have a big meeting with a good choir and with a good, eloquent speaker to stir up people's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is according to the constitution of today's degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the new way we see in the Word is that all the members of the Body function Eph 4:16; Rom 12:4-5; 1 Cor 12:15-17, 21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the small meetings in the homes, and even in a big meeting when the entire church comes together, everybody should function.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everybody should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This one has a hymn, that one has a revelation, and another one has a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have found out that in the new home meetings of newly baptized believers it is so easy for them to function.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Their children even function in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The little ones read the Bible and may take the lead to sing, and everybody speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today on this earth we cannot see that the Body of Christ is fully and thoroughly expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Wherever Christians meet together, what is seen is something organized and arranged with a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is hardly any livingness or flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone who comes to the meeting gets settled.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are so active in their homes, but in the church meeting, they feel they need to be formal, silent, and passive.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should be motivated by the indwelling Spirit in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Motivator within us is the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we come together with a small number, we should function.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever we come together with a big number, we still should function.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have something to say, something to pray about, something to praise and thank the Lord for.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We even have something to shout about.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can all say, "Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should be happy and joyful in the Lord Phil 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our burden and our vision is that on this earth groups of Christians will meet in a living way with no big speaker and not according to forms or organization.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In many denominations, they merely put the numbers of the hymns to be sung on the board, but some should always come to the meeting with a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The New Testament presents us a picture of the church meeting, that is, whenever the church meets, either with a big or small number, it meets in a living way according to the leading of the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We hope that this could be repeated on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We want to have this started from the newly established home meetings.</S>
