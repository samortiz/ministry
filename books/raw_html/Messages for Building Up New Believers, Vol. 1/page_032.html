 <h2 class="head1">III. COMING OUT FROM THEIR MIDST<br />
TO BE WELCOMED BY THE ALL-SUFFICIENT LORD</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 6:17-18 says, &ldquo;Therefore &lsquo;come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you&rsquo;; &lsquo;and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the New Testament the words Lord Almighty are used for the first time in 2 Corinthians 6. <em>Lord Almighty</em> is <em>Elshadai</em> in Hebrew. <em>El</em> is God, <em>sha</em> is a mother&rsquo;s breast or milk, and <em>shadai</em> means something that is with milk. In Hebrew <em>shadai</em> means &ldquo;all-sufficient.&rdquo; The words <em>Almighty God</em> in the Old Testament are also <em>Elshadai,</em> which should be translated as &ldquo;the All-sufficient God.&rdquo; The mother&rsquo;s milk is all that a child needs. The mother&rsquo;s breasts contain the milk; all the supply is in the breasts. The root of the word <em>shadai</em> is &ldquo;the mother&rsquo;s breast.&rdquo; This means that with God we have everything.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 6:17 tells us that if we come out from their midst and do not touch their unclean things, God will welcome us and be a Father to us. We shall be sons and daughters to Him, says the <em>All-sufficient</em> Lord. We can see that these words have not been spoken lightly. The Lord is saying, &ldquo;Because of Me you have left many things. You have come out from their midst and are separated from them. You have terminated your relationships with them and are no longer touching their unclean things. Your two hands are empty, and there is nothing left in you. Now that you have done all this, I will welcome you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please remember that everyone who feels welcomed by the Lord is separated from the world. Many people do not feel the excellency of the Lord when they come to Him because they have not counted all things as refuse. Those who have not counted all things as refuse surely consider earthly things precious. Such people do not know what it means for God to welcome them; they do not know what it means for God to be their Father and for them to be God&rsquo;s children. They do not know that the One who spoke these words is the all-sufficient Lord. Can you see the special significance of the word <em>shadai?</em> The words <em>Lord Almighty</em> are used here because when a person has cast away everything, he needs God as the <em>Shadai;</em> he needs a Father who is all-sufficient.</p>
<p>Psalm 27:10 tells us that if our father and mother forsake us, Jehovah will take us up. In other words, He becomes our father. Psalm 73:26 says that when our flesh and our heart fail, God is the rock of our heart and our portion forever. Herein lies the sweetness of our experience. There must be loss on one side before there can be gain on the other side. The blind man met the Lord only after he was cast out of the synagogue (John 9:35). If we remain in the synagogue, we will never meet the Lord. But when we are cast out, we see the Lord&rsquo;s blessing upon us immediately.</p>
<p>As new believers we must come out from the world. Only then will we taste the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness. Once we drop something on one side, we will taste the goodness of the Lord on the other side.</p>
