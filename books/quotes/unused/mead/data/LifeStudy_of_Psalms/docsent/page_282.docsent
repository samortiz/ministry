   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. GOD'S CARE AND DELIVERANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF HIS REDEEMED IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 107 is on God's care and deliverance of His redeemed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No doubt, God takes care of us every day, always delivering us, rescuing us, and saving us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When some hear this, they may say that this is comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yes, it is comfort, but it is the divine comfort in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we speak of the comfort in this psalm, we have to say that this is the comfort in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we will say, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, if we speak of divine comfort without seeing that this comfort is in Christ, we will not say, "Hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is the One who induces us to speak hallelujahs and to praise the Lord not for comfort, care, or deliverance but for Christ, in whom we are.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A. The Thanks of God's Redeemed,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Gathered from the East, West, North, and South</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good,/For His lovingkindness is forever./Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so,/Whom He redeemed from the hand of the adversary,/And gathered out of the lands,/From the east and from the west, /From the north and from the south" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word "redeemed" in verse 2 implies Christ, for He is our Redeemer and even our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This gives us the ground to say that the comfort in this psalm is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Christ we enjoy God's care and deliverance, which imply His rescue and saving every day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, the gathering out of the lands, from the east, west, north, and south, mentioned in verse 2 corresponds to Revelation 5:9, which speaks of those purchased for God by Christ's blood "out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this matter we once again use the New Testament to interpret the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. God's Care and Deliverance</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>of the Wanderers</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Psalm 107:4-9 speaks of God's care and deliverance of the wanderers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such ones "wandered in the wilderness, on the desert way;/They found no city of habitation./Hungry and thirsty,/Their soul fainted within them" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was our situation before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We were homeless and famished; we were without a habitation and without food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then God took care of us and delivered us, providing us food and a lodging place.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah, in the church we are at home, and we are fed every day!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our testimony is that "He satisfies the thirsty soul,/And the famished soul He fills with good" v. 9 .</S>
