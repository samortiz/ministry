   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE A MYSTERY CHRIST MAGNIFIED THE MYSTERY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament Christ has a particular title.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christians are familiar with many of the titles of Christ: Lord, Redeemer, Savior, Messiah, Son of God, Son of Man, the seed of woman, the seed of Abraham, the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in Colossians 2:2 we see a very particular title of Christ the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the Greek, the last part of this verse reads, "To the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, even Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is altogether a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nothing in the universe is as mysterious as God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although God exists, no one has ever seen Him John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, God appeared to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How could God have appeared to Abraham without Abraham seeing Him?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This certainly is not logical.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Acts 7:2 says that the God of glory appeared to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, the Bible says that no one has ever seen God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Old Testament God appeared at least once in the form of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Genesis 18 Abraham was sitting one day by the door of his tent, and he saw three men coming to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Genesis 18:2 says, "And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One of these three was Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After greeting them, Abraham had a large meal prepared for them, a meal consisting of cakes, a calf, butter, and milk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, Abraham not only saw God, but served Him a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can we say that Abraham did not see God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, according to Genesis 18, Abraham took a walk with Him and talked to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, when the Bible says that no one has ever seen God, it is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anything with an image must be visible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How then can the invisible God have a visible image?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is God visible or invisible?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And how could He appear in the form of a man before the incarnation of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Two thousand years before the incarnation, God appeared to Abraham in the form of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a mystery, and I cannot explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Colossians 2:2, Christ is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I cannot provide an adequate definition of this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I could, it would no longer be a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is a mystery, and the mystery of God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, God as a mystery is embodied in the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, Christ is the embodiment of God as the universal mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In all of history there is not another person as mysterious as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He surely is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today all nations use Christ's calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The calendar of all mankind is the calendar of the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Like Christ, the church also has a number of titles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church is the gathering of the called ones, the household of God, the Body of Christ, and the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Ephesians 3:4, the church also has a particular title the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we consider Ephesians 3:4 in context, we see that the mystery of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God is a mystery, Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the church is actually a mystery within a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church is a mystery in the third stage.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first stage is God Himself as the mystery, the second is Christ as the mystery of God, and the third is the church as the mystery of Christ.</S>
