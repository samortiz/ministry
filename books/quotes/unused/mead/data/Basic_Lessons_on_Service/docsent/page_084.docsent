   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Most of the time we remain in the realm of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We do good things not by the spirit but by our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But God does not want us to remain in the realm, in the field, of good and evil by using our soul to do good and to reject evil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God wants us to deny our natural being and use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we use only our spirit, we are out of the field, the realm, of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we are in the realm of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we are not using our mind, emotion, will, and fallen body, we are using our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we touch only life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The spirit touches nothing except life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First John reveals that our regenerated spirit, which is born of God, does not practice sin 3:9; John 3:6b , but this does not mean that we do not sin or are without sin 1 John 1:8 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some teach wrongly that a regenerated person does not sin and cannot sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They teach the eradication of sin, saying that sin is altogether eradicated from a regenerated person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, there is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many years ago in Shanghai, there was a preacher who strongly taught the heresy of the eradication of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day he and some of his followers went to a park which required them to purchase tickets in order to be admitted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He bought three or four tickets to be used by a total of five persons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some of them entered the park with the tickets, and then one of them came out with the tickets and gave them to the others for them to enter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That preacher brought his young followers into that park in a sinful way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result of this, one of the young men began to doubt about the teaching of eradication.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He went to the preacher and asked him if this was a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The preacher responded by saying that it was not a sin but a little weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But regardless of what term you use, sin is sin, and we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although you may call it another name, it remains sin nonetheless.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should never accept a teaching which says that we have become so spiritual that it is impossible for us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, even though we are still fallen, our regenerated spirit cannot practice sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Fallen man has a spirit which is reserved for God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To repent involves the conscience, and the conscience is a part of man's spirit Rom 9:1; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For God's own purpose, He preserved a part of man for Himself, that is, man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our spirit is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only our regenerated spirit does not sin, so we have to live in our spirit.</S>
