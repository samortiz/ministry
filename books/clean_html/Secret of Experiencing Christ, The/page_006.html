<P>After reading these two verses, you might ask, "Who sent the Spirit, the Son or the Father?" One verse, 15:26, says that the Son sent the Spirit, and the other, 14:26, that the Father sent the Spirit in the Son's name. Both the Son and the Father are the Sender. The Two send the same Spirit. The Son sent the Spirit with the Father, and the Father sent the Spirit in the Son's name. Eventually, when the Spirit comes, the Three all come, because the Spirit sent by the Son comes with the Father, and the Spirit sent by the Father comes in the name of the Son. Hence, when the Spirit is given, when the Spirit enters into us, we have not only the Spirit, but the Spirit with the Father in the Son's name.</P><P>Many have believed in the Lord Jesus and have received Him as their Savior. They realize that the Lord Jesus is in them, but because they may not be so zealous for the Lord, they feel that they do not have the Spirit. To them the Lord in whom they have believed and whom they have received is only the Savior, but not the Spirit. The Lord is only qualified to die for them on the cross, to redeem them, and to save them, but He cannot inspire them and make them zealous for Him. In their concept, they have Christ, but they do not have the Spirit. According to their thinking, the Spirit is outside of them, and they still need to receive the Spirit apart from Christ.</P><P>Actually, Christ is always with the Father, and the Father is always with the Spirit. The Three are distinct, but They are not separate. The Bible does not convey the thought that the Son is on the earth, the Father is in the heavens, and the Spirit is like a dove in the air. It does not teach us that when we receive Christ into us, the Father remains on the throne in the heavens, and the Spirit is still waiting for us to open up to Him. On the contrary, especially in the Gospel of John we are told clearly that the Father is always with the Son, and the Spirit is always with the Father. When we have the Son, we have the Spirit with the Father. When we have One, we have all Three.</P><P>We need to realize that when we have the Lord Jesus within us, we have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Our God is triune. He is not three separate Persons, but one Triune God. The English word "triune" is composed of two Latin words, "tri," meaning three, and "une," meaning one. Our God is one, yet He is three; He is three, yet still one. When we have One, we have all Three.</P><P>When we have the Son, we have the Father, for the Father is with the Son. We also have the Spirit, for the Spirit comes with the Father. There is no need for us to attempt to receive the Spirit apart from the Father and the Son. We only need to pray, "Lord Jesus, thank You that You are in me. I do realize that the Spirit is with You, and the Father is also with You. When I have You, I have the Father, and I also have the Spirit."</P><P>If we check with our own experiences, we will realize that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we have the Lord Jesus, we have the Spirit, and we also have the Father with the Son. This kind of experience may have caused us to wonder who was in us, the Father, the Son, or the Spirit. While we are praying, we may feel that the Son is within us. Then, in the next moment we may sense that the Father is within us, and then after another moment, that the Spirit is within us.</P><P>When I was young my spiritual vision was not so clear. While praying I often became bothered and stopped to think, "On whom should I call? Should I call on the Lord Jesus, or should I call Abba, Father, or should I call on the Holy Spirit?" According to my feeling, all Three were there with me. Three were there, yet these Three were one. When I called, "O Lord Jesus," the Father was there. When I called, "O Father," the Lord Jesus was there. At times, because I did not have a clear vision, I called on all Three at the same time.</P><P>We should not be bothered, but feel free to pray, "Lord Jesus, I thank You. O Father, I worship You. O Holy Spirit, thank You that You are with me." There is nothing wrong with such a prayer, because the Three of the Trinity are not separate. They are three-one. Therefore, in Matthew 28:19 the Lord told the disciples to go and disciple the nations, baptizing them into the one name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>If we have a clear vision, we will be able to avoid many complications. For example, some Christian groups feel that they should baptize people three times, once in the name of the Father, once in the name of the Son, and once in the name of the Holy Spirit. I would not criticize this practice or say that it is wrong. However, I do feel that it is somewhat complicating and bothering. We do not have three Gods, but one unique God. We do not worship three Gods, but one God who is triune, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Strictly speaking, therefore, there is no need to baptize people three times. One time is good enough. I say this to illustrate how we need a clear vision concerning the Person of Christ.</P><P>Our Christ is all-inclusive. He is the complete God, and our God is triune&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We do not have three Gods; we have only one God, who is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Hallelujah, this unique God is Christ! We need to realize that when we experience Him, we experience the Triune God. We not only experience Jesus Christ, but we experience the complete Triune God.</P>
