   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:11 and 12 Paul reminds us of our situation when we were apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, we were strangers from the covenants of the promise, we had no hope, and we were without God in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We had no goal and no God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But one day we were called by God, and we answered His call by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we did this, the Triune God came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No matter where we may go, even if we try to run from the Lord or to stop believing in Him, He will always be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How wonderful that we have become involved with Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, even when it does not seem so wonderful in our experience, we cannot get away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may try to leave Him, but He will never leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As saved ones, we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is our sphere and our source.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now in Christ Jesus we who once were far off from God and from one another have become near in the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As verse 14 says, the very Christ who is our peace has made us one and has broken down the middle wall of partition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has reconciled us to God in one Body, and He has come to preach to us the gospel of peace vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The result is that we are no longer strangers and sojourners, but fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God v. 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although Christ is our sphere, our source, and our peace and although He has abolished the ordinances, many Christians still hold to certain ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In their practice, they care more for ordinances than for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians neglect Christ and pay attention to the very ordinances He abolished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What a pitiful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BUILT ON CHRIST AS THE FOUNDATION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He should be the unique foundation upon which we are built.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 2:20 Paul speaks of the foundation of the apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This refers to the Christ in whom the apostles believed and whom they ministered to others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The foundation of Moses was the law, and the foundation of the prophets was prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the only foundation of the apostles and prophets is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1 Corinthians 3:11 Paul said, For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The foundation in Ephesians 2 is not related to any kind of ordinances; it is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The foundation of Judaism is composed of the Sabbath, circumcision, and the dietary regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when the apostles came forth to minister, the unique foundation laid by them was the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is built on Christ, not on ordinances or regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today, however, all the denominations have another foundation besides Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, the Baptist denomination has immersion as a foundation along with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seems that underneath Christ as the foundation the denominations have something other than Christ as their basic foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church has been divided by the different ordinances used as foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May the Lord open our eyes to see how dreadful it is to cling to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may claim to see the church, and we may declare that we are meeting as the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if we still insist on particular practices, those practices will become ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Spontaneously, the ground of oneness will be damaged or even lost.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of meeting on the ground of oneness, we shall meet on the ground of our ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a certain ordinance becomes our ground, we cease to be the church and become a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we insist on a particular practice, we lose the unique ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why we should not insist on things such as pray-reading or calling on the name of the Lord, even though we may receive great benefit from them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THINGS WE MUST OPPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are only a few things we must oppose.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These include idolatry, immorality, divisiveness, and the denial of Christ s deity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the church absolutely no ground can be given to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Idolatry is an insult to God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Likewise, the church cannot tolerate immorality, which damages the humanity created by God for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, a factious, sectarian person must be rejected if he does not cease from his divisiveness after being warned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Fourthly, we cannot receive into the church anyone who refuses to recognize the deity of Christ, who denies that Christ is God incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These things are leaven which must be purged out of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But apart from these four things, we are not told in the New Testament to reject believers for any other reason.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to Romans 14:1, as long as a person has the faith, we must receive him, even if he is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nowhere in the New Testament are we instructed to reject someone if he does not believe in immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Neither are we told not to receive those sisters who do not wear head coverings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Believers should not be rejected over things such as the size of cup used at the Lord s table or over the practice of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Apart from the four things we have mentioned, there is no legality in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must receive all the saints and have nothing to do with ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Christ who is our peace, our source, and our sphere must be our unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There must not be any other kind of foundation in addition to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to check with ourselves concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do we have any foundation in addition to Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do not have any ordinances, then Christ will truly be our only foundation.</S>
