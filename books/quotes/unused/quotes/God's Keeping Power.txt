It is a distressing fact that some Christians believe in God's saving power, but they do not believe in His keeping power
Numbers 13:30 says, 'Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well able to prevail'
A person who wholly follows the Lord and reckons Him to be trustworthy is one who does the will of God and does it at once
They looked at the inhabitants of the land and saw that they were 'men of great size' and their cities were 'fortified and very large'
Herein lies the reason why so many Christians fail to experience God's keeping power difficulties fill their vision
We may think that we can deal with other problems but that there is no way that we can deal with one particular problem
The whole question in relation to overcoming is: Are we trusting in ourselves, or are we trusting in the Lord?
If we are trusting in God, there is no ground for fear, and victory is assured no matter how great the men and how high the city may be
The inhabitants of the land were admittedly 'men of great size,' but in Caleb's eyes, they were food for God's people
Our bread is not only the word of God our meat is not only to do His will our bread is also the Anakim the difficulties that are in our way
Many people take the word of God as their bread and the doing of His will as their meat, but they have not eaten the Anakim
Many Anakim had been assimilated by him over the years that he had developed a constitution which showed no trace of age
Some brothers and sisters have met few difficulties, but it is obvious that there are many weaknesses in their lives
The sight of any trouble strikes terror into the heart of those who do not have faith, but those who trust Him say, 'Here comes my food'!
In order to experience His salvation, and in order to have His keeping power, we must believe wholeheartedly in His promises
If after we have overcome, we doubt whether our overcoming experience can be sustained, we are discrediting His keeping power
If we implicitly rely on Him, even when we are unexpectedly assailed by temptations, an amazing thing will happen
Many people fail to experience the blessedness of His keeping power because they have never put themselves into His care
If you truly have, then you will be able to say with Paul, 'I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day'
Brothers and sisters, if we commit ourselves unreservedly into His care, we will marvel at the way we are kept
When a sudden temptation demands patience, without giving it a moment's thought, our patience will rise up to meet the need
Praise God, as the life we received from Adam spontaneously expresses itself, so also does the life we receive from Christ
