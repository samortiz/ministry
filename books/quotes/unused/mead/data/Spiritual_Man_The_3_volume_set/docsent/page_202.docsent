   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPIRITUAL WARFARE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In spiritual warfare, a believer does not always attack the enemy because he forgets the principle of the cooperation of the spirit and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, he waits for "God's burden."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He thinks that he does not have the "sense" to fight and should wait until he has such a sense before attacking the enemy with prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he would merely pray according to his mind for a while, the sense in the spirit will immediately respond.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We already know how wicked the evil spirit is and how he damages both the Lord's children and worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also clearly know that we should oppose him by prayer to speed him to the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since this is our realization, we should not wait for a sense in the spirit to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though we have no feelings, we have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should first use our mind to initiate the prayer, using words which we know curse the evil spirit; then our spirit will move, and the words with which we have cursed him will be backed up by the power of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the morning, for example, the Holy Spirit may grant us a considerable anointing in the spirit to curse the evil spirit, but by noontime we may have lost this anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What should we do then?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must apply our mind to act in the same way that our spirit acted in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What has been obtained in the spirit must be guarded and applied by the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>RAPTURE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the same with the faith of rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the beginning we acquired "the spirit of rapture," but before long we may feel as if our spirit is empty, as if we do not have any sense concerning the imminence of the Lord's coming and the reality of our rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At this time we should remember the principle of the mind cooperating with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should pray with the mind in the absence of a sense in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we simply expect our spirit to be filled again with the sense of rapture, we will not acquire it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to consider and pray according to what we know in our mind, then what we acquired previously will fill our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>PREACHING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This principle must not be forgotten in the spreading of God's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know that the truths we learned in the old days are just stored in our brain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we impart them to people only from our mind, there will not be any spiritual effect.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the beginning we no doubt knew these truths in the spirit, but now it seems as if the spirit has faded and there is only the memory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What should we do to have our spirit once again filled with these truths in order to spread these truths to others from our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can do nothing except exercise our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should reconsider these truths and pray again before God, using these truths as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before long, we will be filled again in our spirit as before.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The truths were originally acquired in the spirit and preserved in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now because of our prayer according to the mind, they reenter our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way we are able to once again proclaim the truths which we have known in our spirit.</S>
