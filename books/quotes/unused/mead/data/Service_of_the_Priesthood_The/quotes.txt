[1]  As the Lord s children, we need a proper spiritual life, and we need the proper spiritual service.
[2]  First we have the aspect of life, then the aspect of service.
[3]  But according to the spiritual reality, the priesthood is the building up of the priests, the coordination, the cooperation of all the priests.
[4]  When we as a Body go to the Lord and remain in His presence, we are the holy priests, the holy, separated ones before God.
[5]  But when we come out of the presence of the Lord after much prayer to minister something of the Lord as life in a powerful way, in a way of heavenly authority, we are royal priests.
[6]  If we are going to serve the Lord in the way of the church service, we must pay our full attention to these three matters.
[7]  We must be separated from the common things unto the Lord and learn how to remain in the presence of the Lord, how to bring the need of the people, the need of the sinful world, to the Lord and pray.
[8]  We need the coordination of the Body, the separation of the holy priests from the world unto the Lord, and the heavenly authority of the royal priests.
[9]  Then we will be qualified, empowered, to minister the Lord to others as the royal priests, the kingly priests, with the heavenly authority.
[10]  If you are one in the coordination of the saints, separated from the world unto the Lord, and one with the heavenly authority, when you pray just a short word, others will sense dominion, power, and reality in your prayer.
