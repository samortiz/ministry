   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>New Jerusalem Coming Down to the New Earth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 2 says, And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians think that this describes a great heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are expecting to go to heaven, but one day this city will come down out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may want to go to heaven, but God wants to come down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The holy city is prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can trace in the Scriptures who the bride and husband are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament God told the people of Israel many times that He was their Husband and that they as His redeemed people were a bride to Him Isa 54:5; 62:5;Jer 2:2; 3:14; 31:32; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>16:8; Hosea 2:16, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the New Testament, John 3:26-30 tells us that the disciples of John the Baptist were jealous and came to John to tell him that people were following after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John said, He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom s voice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ comes as the Bridegroom for the bride, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is only part of the bride in Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The children of Israel in the ancient time are also a part of this bride.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, in Revelation 12 there is a wonderful woman clothed with the sun, with the moon underneath her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This refers to the three main dispensations in the Scriptures the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of law, and the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The stars signify the patriarchs, the moon signifies God s people in the age of the law, and the sun signifies God s people in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the redeemed ones within these three dispensations together comprise this wonderful, universal woman, who is the very bride.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, in chapter twelve she is not yet prepared as the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She is not prepared until chapter twenty-one because after the thousand years all the redeemed ones will be matured, perfected, and built up together as the universal bride.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At this point every part of this wonderful bride will be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Peoples on the New Earth The Tabernacle of God Being with Men</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 21:3 says, And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John saw the holy city as a prepared bride, but a voice told him that it is a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This corresponds with the teaching of the entire Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Old Testament times, the people of God were a bride to God on the one hand, and the dwelling place of God on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Among the children of Israel there was first the tabernacle and then the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the physical tabernacle and temple were not the real dwelling place of God; they were signs of the people of Israel themselves as the very tabernacle, temple, and dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Testament the church is both the bride of Christ Eph 5:25-32; 2 Cor 11:2 and the temple, the dwelling place of God Eph 2:21-22; 1 Cor 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we come to the end of the entire revelation of the Scriptures, we still see these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The redeemed ones are composed together as the bride of Christ and as the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The bride is a counterpart to Christ, and the tabernacle is a dwelling place to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God Tabernacling with Them</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation 21:3 says that God will tabernacle with the peoples on the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that God s presence, God Himself, will always be with them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this chapter the first item of God s blessing is His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is by God s presence that the peoples on the new earth can be His people and that God can be their God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without the presence of God, they could never be the people of God, and God could never be the very God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The promise of God s presence in verse 3 is to the peoples on the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, God s redeemed ones will enjoy His presence in a more subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God will dwell only with the peoples on the new earth, but He will dwell in His redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the greatest blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No blessing is greater, sweeter, or higher than the presence of God Himself within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This blessing will last for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What else can we want?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To have God Himself dwelling in us and to have His presence always with us is more than wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many today are seeking for other blessings, but we must realize that God s eternal blessing to us is Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot say what the eternal presence of God will be like, but to some extent we have the foretaste of the presence of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever we have the sense of the presence of God, everything is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Regardless of whether or not there is a change in our circumstances, as long as we have the presence of God within us, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Wiping Away Every Tear from Their Eyes</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 4 continues, And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore; for the former things have passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the new heaven and new earth there will be full satisfaction and rest; there will be no more cause for tears.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moreover, death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow, crying, or pain.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because sin will have been dealt with, death will be cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sorrow is within the heart, crying is the outward expression, and pain is suffering in the body; all these will be no more, for the former things will have passed away.</S>
