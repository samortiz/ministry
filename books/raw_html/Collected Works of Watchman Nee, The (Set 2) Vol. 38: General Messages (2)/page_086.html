<h2 class="head1">HOW TO DEAL WITH DIFFERENCES<br />BETWEEN HUSBANDS AND WIVES</h2><p>I have seen many families. I have been a guest in at least a hundred to two hundred homes. Of course, the number of families I have contacted exceeds this number. Many people think that a golden era will come after they are married and that they will have a wonderful life and family. But after three days, the husband discovers that his heavenly angel is just an ordinary girl, and the wife discovers that her imaginary hero is just one from among two hundred million Chinese. If a couple lacks the calibrating factor, what will be the result? What will happen after one month, two months, a year, or two years? If they were given the choice again, they would say that they would be the last ones to get married. Many regrets and thoughts of change occur because a couple did not adjust their differences at the beginning of their marriage. Therefore, I will speak a little on the adjustment of differences.</p><h2 class="head1">REALIZING THAT GETTING MARRIED<br />IS TAKING UP A JOB</h2><p>A husband has to set his mind on becoming a husband, and a wife has to set her mind on becoming a wife. Many husbands become husbands in a mindless way; they have no intention of living like a husband. Likewise, many wives become wives in a mindless way; they have no intention of living like a wife. They bump into each other, and one happens to become the husband, while the other happens to become the wife. If you want to be someone's husband or wife, you have to do it intentionally. You have to be a husband or wife consciously and conscientiously. Nothing in this world can be accomplished in a haphazard way. Even if you want to be a nanny or a rickshaw driver, you can succeed only if you do it intentionally and conscientiously. No one can succeed in being a husband or a wife in a mindless or haphazard way. Once, a brother and a sister were about to be married, and they asked me for a word to symbolize marriage. I said that marriage is like taking a job. It is a job to be a husband, and our brother is here to take this job. It is also a job to be a wife, and our sister is here to take this job. If you do not regard being a husband as a job, you cannot be a husband, and if you do not regard being a wife as a job, you cannot be a wife.</p><h2 class="head1">ALLOWING CHRIST TO BE THE LORD IN EVERYTHING</h2><p>The wife should never think that her husband will have the same opinion as she does. You may as well drop this dream now, because tomorrow you will wake up from this dream. Perhaps, you have awoken from it already. Perhaps, while the two of you were shopping the last few days, you awoke from that dream. The wife cannot expect her husband's opinion to be the same as hers, and the husband cannot expect his wife's opinion to be the same as his. You have to remember that your husband is an individual person, and you have to remember that your wife is an individual person. You must be prepared to accept this fact. Then what should you do? Many people consider that the only way is through compromise; they step back a little and close their mouth. Suppose you want to buy something red, and I prefer green. Since there is this difference, I let you choose the red and give up the green. But please consider that only the most foolish woman in the world would allow her husband to step back and shut up. He may be stepping back, but in his heart he is secretly saying, "I let her have her way this time, but..." You should never think that you have gained the upper hand. You have just put a hole in your boat with a nail. Nothing may leak out, but something will surely come in. The solution does not involve retreating or stepping back.</p><p>Thank the Lord that you are Christians, and it is easier to deal with this matter. This is not a matter of stepping back or giving way. You should allow the Lord to say what you should do. You should let the Lord be the "bad man." You do not have to allow your husband to be a "bad man," nor do you have to allow your wife to be the "bad man." Let the Lord be the "bad man." As the husband, you should put your proposal aside, and as the wife, you should put your proposal aside. Both the husband and the wife should put their proposals aside and together consider what the Lord is saying. If the Lord says to choose red, neither will have anything more to say. Christ must be the Head of the household. Brother, you are not the head of your household. Sister, you are not the head of your household either. The Head of the household is Christ. Just as Christ is the Lord who is controlling you in your personal life and living, so Christ should also be the Lord who is controlling your family affairs. If your wife insists that something should be done one way, then you should ask whether or not she is assured that this is the will of the Lord. I am not saying that you should merely step back; I am saying that you should step back to God. Those who fear God will not fabricate God's will. If she does not know God's will in the matter, you may be able to say, "I know what God's will is." However, if you do not know God's will either, you should say nothing and buy neither the red thing or the green thing.</p>
