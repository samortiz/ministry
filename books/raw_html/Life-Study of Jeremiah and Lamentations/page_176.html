<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONTENT OF THE NEW COVENANT&#151;<br>THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>The content of the new covenant is the Triune God, who has been processed and consummated to become everything to God's chosen people. This new covenant was promised to Israel in Jeremiah 31:31-34 (cf. Heb. 8:8-13), and it was absolutely, thoroughly, and completely fulfilled by the Lord Jesus when He established His table (Matt. 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Cor. 11:23-26). In instituting the table, the Lord Jesus made a covenant with the New Testament believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE IMPORTANCE<br>OF THE BOOK OF JEREMIAH</H2><P>The most important part of the book of Jeremiah is the portion on the new covenant. Since Jeremiah spoke regarding the new covenant, this book, in a sense, is more important than the writings of Moses, which do not say anything about the new covenant. Although Moses prophesied very much concerning Christ, the covenant God made with Israel through him had nothing to do with Jesus Christ. Based on the fact that the book of Jeremiah prophesies concerning the new covenant, the book of Jeremiah may be considered an Old Testament book that is also a New Testament book.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE POSITION AND FUNCTION<br>OF THE OLD COVENANT OF THE LAW</H2><P>At this point, we need to say a word regarding the position and function of the old covenant of the law.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Its Position</H2><P>The position of the covenant of the law was that of a concubine. In Galatians 4 Paul tells us that Abraham had two wives, representing two covenants. Sarah, the proper wife, represents the new covenant, and Hagar, the concubine, represents the old covenant of law. Because Hagar, the concubine, symbolizes the old covenant of the law, the position of this covenant is the position of a concubine. As Abraham cast out Hagar, when Christ came He put aside the old covenant and made it of no effect, replacing it with the new covenant.</P><P>Furthermore, in Romans 5:20 Paul tells us that "the law entered in alongside." This means that the law was added later, that it was not God's original intention to have the law. Rather, the law later came in alongside of something that was present before the law came. This indicates that the main line of God's economy was there already.</P>
