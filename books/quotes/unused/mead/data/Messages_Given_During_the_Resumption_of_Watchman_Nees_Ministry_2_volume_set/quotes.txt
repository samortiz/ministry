[1]  By the mercy of God, in 1947 the church in Shanghai in China experienced a great revival.
[2]  When the news spread to other places, the churches in the provinces of Fukien and Kwangtung, together with the church in Hong Kong, invited me to visit them.
[3]  At the same time, co-workers from northern and southern China, together with co-workers from the West, decided to come together in Shanghai the following year for a co-workers' conference and to share the Lord's grace one with another.
[4]  What impressed me the most and rendered me the greatest help are eight things: 1 the knowledge and realization of the Body of Christ, 2 the knowledge and denial of the self, 3 the knowledge of and submission to the authority in the Body of Christ, 4 the knowledge and acceptance by the co-workers of the "line of Jerusalem," 5 the service and coordination of the whole Body of Christ, 6 the need and practice of handing over oneself with all one has, 7 the leading and coordination among the co-workers, and 8 the importance of the Holy Spirit in the service in the Body of Christ.
[5]  This book is a translation from Chinese of a collection of messages taken from brief meeting notes of Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi and his first wife, Lin I-tien.
[6]  The main burdens of these meetings are the believers' living by the life of God and the proper way to serve in the church.
[7]  The main burdens are the way of recovery that the church takes on earth today, the recovery of the Body life, the coordination of the co-workers, ministry and authority, the relationship between the local churches and the work, release from the bondage of money, the way to preach the gospel, and the way to arrive at the universal priestly service.
[8]  Whether you see this matter all at once, or you realize it through a process, the minute you touch this matter, you touch a fact not a feeling, but a fact.
[9]  Once I took a leader of the China Inland Mission to hear Brother T.
[10]  After the message, others would usually ask about the message just given.
[11]  But on my way home with this brother, I did not ask him anything.
[12]  This leader, Mr. Baker, asked, "How then are you able to get along with him?" No doubt those who are outwardly strong in their will do not easily get along with others.
[13]  But this brother did not realize that we are one because of our inner man; it is not because of our outer will.
[14]  We are familiar with the term "Son of God," but we seldom say "the Christ of God."
[15]  Scripture Reading: Matthew 11:1-19 NOT BEING CAUSED TO STUMBLE BY THE LORD
[16]  The passage we just read records how men were caused to stumble by the Lord.
[17]  Here John the Baptist must have been extremely puzzled by Christ.
[18]  Before this time, John the Baptist gave a strong testimony for Jesus, declaring that Christ is the Lamb of God and that He came to take away the sin of the world John 1:29 .
[19]  If it is not placed in the proper place, it will not shine; if the bulb could speak, it would tell you that it was senseless that it should be there.
[20]  THE WAY TO BE GOD'S VESSEL A. Removing Hindrances and
[21]  God desires to gain man so that He can put Himself into man.
[22]  God desires to have such a vessel that can contain Him and express Him here and now.
[23]  This is because I am a living creature; I have a will, an emotion, preferences, inclinations, choices, a mind, and imaginations, not to mention the many sinful and evil things that are within me.
[24]  A voice within will tell you that you have not turned to God enough, that you have not been godly enough, and that you have not obeyed Him enough.
[25]  If you ask me why I am speaking on this subject tonight, I will tell you that it is not the Bible that tells me to speak this way, but the inner feeling that tells me to speak this way.
[26]  TO LIVE HIMSELF OUT OF US SPECIAL CONFERENCE 2
[27]  If we read through the Old and the New Testament, we will see that God has one specific purpose in man.
[28]  After a person is saved, all his spiritual experiences consist of allowing God to gain the proper ground within him.
[29]  Brothers and sisters, if God grants mercy to you, and He touches you or visits you, you will begin to take care of every inner feeling.
[30]  If you would give yourself to God in this way, and if tomorrow morning while you are putting on your clothes, the Lord says to you, "Don't put on this piece of clothing," what will you do?
[31]  This is like those who have a sweet tooth devouring sweet things when they see them and rejecting spicy things that are served to them.
[32]  A person can be fussy with food, but he cannot be a Christian in this way.
[33]  A person can be a "pew-Christian," a "Sunday-going Christian," but such a one will never afford God the way to go on.
[34]  You may say that you are willing and that you hope the Lord will help your weakness.
[35]  God will surely not listen to such a prayer because by praying in this way you have opened a back door already; you have made provision for yourself to disobey already.
[36]  There is no need for those who do not obey their inner feelings to vindicate themselves; there is no need for them to tell God that they are serving Him.
[37]  As long as you remain simple, and as long as you are for God and are pure toward Him, you do not need to analyze too much.
[38]  If you practice this, after a while, your emotions, desires, and thoughts will become one with God, and spontaneously God will fill you up.
[39]  CHAPTER FIVE THE INDWELLING OF CHRIST SPECIAL CONFERENCE 3
[40]  You are not only performing what is after His heart; you are also acting according to His feelings and His thoughts, and you are taking Him as your content and as everything to you.
[41]  If you study the Bible much, yet you do not fellowship with God in your studying, your Bible study cannot be considered spiritual; it can only be considered mental.
[42]  CHAPTER SIX THE GRACE OF GOD SPECIAL CONFERENCE 4
[43]  Many times we hear people say, "Thank God for His grace, that I have not had any accident."
[44]  If you have God within you, if you live by God, and if God becomes your life and your strength, and He comforts you, supports you, and is with you all the time, you are experiencing God's grace.
[45]  The principle of the Christian life and of spiritual experiences is a matter of living by God.
[46]  Spiritual experience is to live by God and to fellowship with God.
[47]  But if you come riding "in" the bus, then whether or not you hold onto it, and whether or not your hands let go, or you sit down or stand up, the bus will carry you here.
[48]  I know what I am speaking, and I know that this is the right way.
[49]  If you ask me, "Brother Lee, what do you do when your children stir up your temper?"
[50]  This does not mean that I do not know what to do.
[51]  Not only was the Samaritan woman thirsty; she was also restless.
[52]  The Lord is not at rest yet because He has not yet gained you.
[53]  If there is one thing you have done that you have never told anyone about, including your parents, your husband, or your wife, you have at least one thing that is not upright.
[54]  When we say that we have received life into us, it means that God has entered into us.
[55]  This means that we ought to know such things already, because a living God is living within us.
[56]  If God tells you to give up certain things and to forsake them, you should say, "Lord, for the sake of loving You, I would forsake them."
[57]  I would like to ask the brothers and sisters who are sitting here if there is anyone who has been obeying God from morning until evening today in every matter.
[58]  If you do not have this desire, even if He were to speak many times, it would still be useless to you.
[59]  If you are not willing to obey, even if you listen to a hundred more messages, it will still not do you any good.
[60]  A few times I found myself arguing with rickshaw drivers.
[61]  There is a difference between what we know and what we feel.
[62]  You may know that a certain medicine is bitter, but it is only after you put the medicine into your mouth that you feel its bitterness.
[63]  There is no teaching that can cause something to happen: No matter how proper, neat, clean, and blameless you are as a person, as long as you are living outside of the Lord, you are not worth anything in God's eyes.
[64]  If God does not gain a person, He will have no work, and He will have no way.
[65]  If doctrines are to give us a way at all, then there is only one way that is useful, which is the way to God.
[66]  If only one-fourth of those among us are used by God in this way, in a few years, the church will increase from one or two hundred people to one or two thousand, and the quality of the people gained will surpass the one or two hundred people that we have today.
[67]  CHAPTER ELEVEN OBEYING THE INNER FEELING FELLOWSHIP MEETING 3
[68]  Brother Shen asked: As far as the inner feeling is concerned, I realize that we should do something only when we have the peace, and we should stop when we lose the peace.
[69]  Many preachers tell others that if a person believes in the Lord he will be blessed.
[70]  They tell others that the Lord is the blessing, and that with Him there is the blessing.
[71]  A Christian is one who is blind, who gives up money and position, and who would rather have his own feeling hurt than offend the Lord's feeling.
[72]  Mrs. Chow asked:Should we obey our parents if they charge us to do something contrary to the Lord? If we disobey them, are we dishonoring them?
[73]  If you have been a good wife for five years, yet God has never increased in you, but has instead decreased in you, you are worth nothing in His eyes.
[74]  During the five years that you have been a wife, daily you should have allowed God time and time again to anoint you with His desire, His heart, and even Himself, so that you would have His element within, and that this element would increase all the time.
[75]  for the Purpose of God Mingling Himself into Us
[76]  The mind of today's Christian is too far away from God's heart.
[77]  We should not obey the inner feeling merely for the sake of being a proper man or to please God, but we should do it to allow God to mingle Himself with us.
[78]  God is exercising His multifarious wisdom to work Himself into us.
[79]  Some have said that God has blessed them and has given them so much money at the end of the year: what immense grace God has bestowed upon them.
[80]  True grace is when a person gains more of God through his relationship with his wife and when he gains more knowledge about God through his job.
[81]  If you would hate a little, God would come in. Your hatred will allow God to gain something in you.
[82]  The year before last, the Communists entered the city of Chefoo, but the brothers and sisters in the local church still continued to meet.
[83]  The denominations used to be quite zealous in preaching the gospel, and they were critical of the local church, saying that we were narrow-minded and that we cared only for our own people and would not fellowship with others, nor would we preach the gospel in the rural villages.
[84]  However, together with the brothers and sisters, we paid attention only to the matter of life and spiritual matters, and we were not affected by their criticisms.
[85]  I only wish to see us turning to the Lord in a pure, direct, and simple way, so that we can touch the Lord in a definite way and can know the way He wants to go on in us.
[86]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN IMAGE AND THE TREE OF LIFE CONFERENCE 2
[87]  Whenever we come into contact with God, we have life.
[88]  Before I come to my subject tonight, I will first ask the brothers and sisters to forget everything that you have heard before and come as if you know nothing about God's word and you are starting all over from the beginning.
[89]  The laws that we are speaking about are not the laws known to the lawyers.
[90]  Fourth, there is the law of the Spirit of life.
[91]  This law comes into us at the time we believe in the Lord.
[92]  May the Lord cause the words that we hear to lead us to the presence of God.
[93]  A Christian should not take good itself as the standard.
[94]  Whether a Christian should or should not do something is based upon whether or not that thing fits his taste.
[95]  This is like whether or not a man drinks a certain kind of soup having nothing to do with whether or not he is glorifying God; it is a matter of his taste.
[96]  We must not only exhort others not to beat their wives; we must also ask based on what does a man not beat his wife.
[97]  A Christian does not smoke, not because smoking will not glorify God, but because smoking is contrary to his taste within.
[98]  CHAPTER TWENTY GOD WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE 1
[99]  Throughout the ages, God has only one work, and that is to work Himself into man.
[100]  If God wants to do something, and you do not know about it, your Christian life is meaningless.
[101]  But if here is a small group of people who would tell the Lord that they are not here to work for Him, but to be worked on by Him, God will have a way here.
[102]  The problem today is that no one is willing to contain God.
[103]  If there is such a group of people, God will have a way here in this place, and man will receive the blessing.
[104]  If by hating your wife you can have more of God in you, you can go ahead and hate your wife as much as you like.
[105]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE CENTER OF GOD'S TRUTH TALKS 3
[106]  Prayer: May the Lord cause the word to come out of us tonight, and may You cause others to receive these words into them.
[107]  They think that making a fortune, having good children, and being free from calamities is God's grace.
[108]  If one day your son has died, or you have gone bankrupt in your business, yet you have an unspeakable power within you to allow you to say "hallelujah," that is God's grace.
[109]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH TALKS 4
[110]  A Christian should not think that as long as something is good, he can do it, and that as long as something is not good, he should not do it.
[111]  What He cares for is to work Himself into us through the things that we encounter.
[112]  After so much experience and so many dealings from the Lord, we can say that there were not many things in his life that he had done right.
[113]  After a brother is saved, he may become clearer concerning all kinds of scriptural knowledge from Genesis to Revelation.
[114]  He may be able to compose better prayers, and his prayers may begin to sound very nice.
[115]  Actually, these are all mud; they are all put onto the side of the wall and are not added on top of the wall.
[116]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE HOW TO FOLLOW THE INNER LEADING CONFERENCE 7
[117]  Prayer: May the Lord give us the light not only while we are listening, but may the light be as the dawning of the day that shines more and more unto the perfect day.
[118]  If you have peace, you can go on, and if you do not have peace, you should stop.
[119]  God's work in us will not necessarily cause us to succeed in what we do.
[120]  But God leads us this way in order that we would submit to Him.
[121]  One day, when the brother learns this lesson, he will praise God when he looks at his wife, not because his wife is good, but because he will have gained God.
[122]  The growth of a Christian depends on his dealing with his conscience.
[123]  In one's pursuit of the Lord, if he does not take care of his conscience, he will never grow.
[124]  If half of the money that went into the purchase of that chair was stolen from others, this person will surely not have peace.
[125]  This means that after a person is saved, he will be enlightened, and his conscience will show him that what he did before was wrong and unrighteous.
[126]  Prayer: May the Lord cause us to speak the things that we ought to speak, and may You cause the listeners to hear what they ought to hear.
[127]  Although these things may be created by God, they do not have the life of God.
[128]  God's glory speaks of God Himself, whereas God's holiness tells us that everything not of God and not according to His nature will be thrown into the lake of fire.
[129]  THREE PERIODS OF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST IN CHINA
[130]  Christianity has been in China for over a hundred years.
[131]  Of course, before that time there were the Nestorians in the Tang Dynasty, which cannot be considered as part of God's work.
[132]  Today's need can no longer be met by revivals.
[133]  If all I have been speaking during the past seven nights were but revival messages, I believe the speaking would not satisfy men.
[134]  When the whole church rises up to preach the gospel, others will only say it is the church that has saved them; they will not say that it is Dr. So-and-so who has saved them.
[135]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN CONCERNING THE WAY OF LIFE OPEN TALKS
[136]  On the one hand, we do not want to be loose; on the other hand, we do not want to be restricted.
[137]  With some people, right after they are saved, they begin to deal with their conscience before God in a thorough way.
[138]  A person can preach the gospel, work, manage a church, and study the Bible, but if he does not obey the Lord, he has not taken a single step forward in God's way.
[139]  CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT GOSPEL, REVIVAL, AND LIFE TALKS 6
[140]  Prayer: May the Lord cause all of us to realize that spiritual matters are not loose or vague.
[141]  May the Lord's word not only be spoken through man, but may every one of the words spoken be filled with light, and may they shine within man.
[142]  This work includes three things: first is the preaching of the gospel, second is to lead the new believers, in particular, the young people, to love the Lord, and the third is to usher the saints into God's life and into the riches of His life.
[143]  Concerning the preaching of the gospel, we have to do it frequently, do it well, do it in a widespread way, and do it in a weighty manner.
[144]  If the whole population in China does not produce any children in fifty years, we will not need foreigners to come in with the cannons and the gunboats to conquer us; we can give up our whole country that way.
[145]  But whatever a person does, if a church continues to have only a few dozen people meeting year after year for decades and there are no spiritual children produced, no matter how good its teachings are, it is not a normal church.
[146]  Once a person asked D. L. Moody if all saved ones were predestinated by God.
[147]  That man then asked what would he do if a person who was not predestinated by God became saved through his preaching.
[148]  After people have believed, we have to lead them, old and young, to love the Lord and to have concrete expressions of love.
[149]  Our money, time, and energy should all be used for the Lord.
[150]  The few years when we were in Chefoo, the number of saved ones increased, and we began to have many home meetings.
[151]  That day, we happened to be reading Isaiah 1 and Jeremiah 8, which say that the ass knows his owner, but that God's people do not know Him, and that the birds in the air know the season, but His people do not know the judgment of the Lord.
[152]  This kind of confession has nothing to do with salvation and has nothing to do with the removal of sin before God.
[153]  When a man believes in the Lord Jesus, his sins are forgiven before God, but these sins may not be forgiven before man.
[154]  The purpose of confession is to be reconciled with men; it is not a demand of God's law, but a step we take to clear our conscience of all blame and to have a good testimony before men.
[155]  The Lord Jesus also tells us that when a man wants to make a sacrifice on the altar, and he remembers that his brother has wronged him, he should first go and be reconciled to his brother.
[156]  If you have fellowship with the Lord, God's life will work in you, and when the light comes, your conscience will be bothered, and it will urge you to deal with your sins.
[157]  Concerning the principle of confession, we have to realize that the conscience deals only with unrighteous things.
[158]  In dealing with our conscience, we need God to give us the wisdom so that we take care of matters in a proper way.
[159]  The principle of dealing with our conscience is that in our dealings God would gain the glory, others would receive the benefit, and we would be edified.
[160]  There are some things which cannot be dealt with, and we can only ask God for His forgiveness.
[161]  Sometimes, it is not God who is telling us to deal with the matters, but Satan who is telling us to do it.
[162]  MAN'S SATISFACTION AND REST THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE 2
[163]  Prayer: May we receive grace from God, and may the brothers and sisters meet You, and may the eyes of their hearts be opened.
[164]  One older brother has been a Christian ever since he was a student in school.
[165]  But for all the years that he had been a Christian, he never knew that God could speak within man.
[166]  If your meeting, praying, and study of the Bible do not satisfy you, it means that God is speaking to you and beckoning you to seek after Him and to have more fellowship with Him.
[167]  It is right that we pray for the brothers and sisters, and sometimes God does give us the burden to pray for others; the more we pray that kind of prayer, the more burden we will have.
[168]  God has no intention for us to know the methods, but He intends for us to have the knowledge of the spiritual things.
[169]  IN THE BODY OF CHRIST Submission Bringing In Benefits
[170]  The first thing we have to see concerning coordination is God's arrangement in the church see 1 Cor 12 .
[171]  If you hit me with your hands, you are offending my head.
[172]  LEARNING TO LISTEN TO OTHERS Listening to Others Being
[173]  In the meeting hall in Chefoo, there is a fixed place for everything, including the rags, the toilet paper, the pencils, and the nails.
[174]  If you want to be a proper brother or sister, you have to declare that we who serve the Lord are people who would listen.
[175]  If you can neither take orders nor give orders, then you can only be one that takes candies; you can only do what you like to do.
[176]  Some brothers have asked me, "What is the requirement for me to come to the church in Shanghai?"
[177]  If you are not told to say something, do not say it.
[178]  It is not a question of whether or not a thing should be said, but a question of learning to listen to others.
[179]  I can testify that before every gospel meeting, I have to speak to the brothers and sisters at least twice, to let every one enter the burden of the gospel before we actually preach to the outsiders.
[180]  A CHURCH LIFE IN WHICH EVERYONE SERVES Passing On the Burden
[181]  When a co-worker goes out to work and to build up a church, he should pass on all his work to the brothers and sisters.
[182]  If you do this, when you leave, you will not need to go through any transfer procedure, for all the things will have been passed on to him already.
[183]  We should not have the concept of coming on Sunday to a so-called service.
[184]  When the brothers and sisters come together on the Lord's Day, they do not come for a "service"; rather, they come with their hearts prepared to hear the Lord's word.
[185]  It is not a matter of listening to a sermon, but a matter of striving together in oneness for the gospel.
[186]  If you think that this is not the right place for you, you can go to some other place, some Christian organization.
[187]  CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE THE WAY TO PERFECT A PERSON TALKS 9
[188]  Although many words about the heart are from the Old Testament, we find the Lord quoting them in the New Testament: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" Matt 22:37 .
[189]  For that reason, they are considered lawless ones v. 23 . If you ask how it could be that a person whose heart is not right can cast out demons, I will tell you that it is indeed possible.
[190]  A person who has learned the lessons is one who is always fearful of God and who always fears Him in everything.
[191]  Whether or not a man fears God depends mainly on whether or not he does things by himself or by the life of God.
[192]  To love God is a matter of the heart.
[193]  If the heart is right before God, it is all right even if the things are done a little bit off.
[194]  Many things in the church life, such as the persons, the things, the events, the relationships one with another, the love toward the church and the brothers and sisters all these can turn man's heart away from the Lord.
[195]  If we are to preach the gospel and save sinners, we have to do it in such a way that some men are perfected in our work before God.
[196]  One responsible brother once assigned some sisters to make some tablecloths.
[197]  After the sisters tried for a few times, the brother was still not satisfied.
[198]  We should afford all the brothers and sisters full opportunity to serve the Lord, to offer up their possessions, and to give up everything they have for the Lord.
[199]  During the revival in Chefoo, of the eight hundred or more brothers and sisters, almost ninety percent of them consecrated everything.
[200]  The Holy Spirit was working, and everyone was enlightened to repent in tears and to vow that they would never hold back the gospel again.
[201]  Many of the saints consecrated their families, their jobs, and everything they had to the Lord.
[202]  When we met together, there was a time when we had only tears before the Lord.
[203]  CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE LIVING BY THE LORD TALKS 11
[204]  Prayer: Lord, what we need is not some passing excitement, stirring up, or exhortation, but the remaining work of the Holy Spirit within us.
[205]  We do not want to be ahead of You, nor do we want to be behind You.
[206]  What we need today is not merely that we do not live for ourselves, but that we do not live ourselves.
[207]  If we do not realize this, we will still trust in our own strength, and we will work according to our own preference.
[208]  But God must work on us to the extent that we realize that it is not enough to do the right thing.
[209]  Outwardly, there does not seem to be very much difference between the two things, but only those who do not know God would think that the difference is an insignificant one.
[210]  If others ask whether this meeting is better or that meeting is better, you should tell them that everything depends on whether or not a person can meet God in a meeting, and whether or not a meeting can satisfy a person's inner need.
[211]  Brother Mak, if others oppose you or criticize you, you do not need to require them to come to you and explain to you what they are doing.
[212]  You have to take the initiative, and you should never be passive.
[213]  There are thousands of ways to answer a question, but I know only one thing, and that is to turn back to life.
[214]  Helping others to know life is like a doctor feeling the pulse of a patient; as soon as a person comes to you, you should be able to give a diagnosis and to discern the spiritual condition of that person.
[215]  If you do this, you will see that you do not have to do anything; the Lord has done everything for you already.
[216]  In our serving together with the brothers and sisters, we have to spend time with them to learn together and to practice together with them.
[217]  Moreover, we have to learn to pass on everything to the saints in a systematic way.
[218]  We should be a person who is living before the Lord, and we should produce men instead of merely producing works.
[219]  The church is like a hospital; not only should the sick ones receive treatment there, but the hospital itself should perfect the doctors and nurses.
[220]  CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX HOW TO BUILD UP THE SERVICES TALKS 12
[221]  Today, man must give God adequate cooperation before He can have a way in the church.
[222]  Concerning assignments for the work in the church, we should allow the brothers and sisters to begin by first learning to serve in one or two specific areas of service, such as gospel preaching.
[223]  CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN ON BEING A PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN TALKS 13
[224]  THE PRACTICAL LIVING OF A CHRISTIAN A. Concerning the Reading of the Bible
[225]  But I have to ask you, how much of the Bible have you read?
[226]  Are we serious about the preaching of the gospel?
[227]  In Swatow you have three hundred people meeting here.
[228]  If everyone would bring one person to the Lord per year, in ten years there will be one hundred fifty thousand people saved.
[229]  Do we have a definite understanding about the condition of the brothers and sisters?
[230]  One brother has been in the church for two months, but this Brother Cheng, who has been in the church for three years, still does not know that one's first name; he only knows that his surname is Chen.
[231]  But if we do not even know the names of one another, how can we have fellowship?
[232]  I do not mean that you have to know everything about the brothers and sisters, but at least you have to know their names.
[233]  If you want me to give you messages, I can give them to you every day for three months, and I will still not exhaust the messages.
[234]  CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE THE WAY OF OUR SERVICE TODAY
[235]  If you consider the church life of the first century, the absolute consecration seen in Acts 2 and 4, the keeping of the apostles' teaching, and the perfecting of the saints unto the fullness of the Body of Christ in Ephesians 4, and compare such conditions with the condition of the church today, there is undoubtedly a vast difference between the two pictures.
[236]  However, what God wants today is to gain a group of people who will stand on God's side under these two contradictory conditions, who will maintain God's testimony, and who will uphold such a testimony of overcomers together with God.
[237]  God's work today is the recovery of the testimony of the Body.
[238]  This Body testimony is not a doctrine, but a reality.
[239]  The Body is not a doctrine, but a spiritual fact.
[240]  If a spiritual matter is recovered, and it is real, it will surely be felt by others.
[241]  Many times, we sacrifice God's word on account of our personal experiences.
[242]  Because our individual experiences are partial and fragmentary, we do not have a complete, overall view of God's word.
[243]  If you see the Body of Christ, you will see the matter of fellowship.
[244]  The life that we received from the Lord makes us pliable and enables us to coordinate together.
[245]  On the other hand, however, we have to see that after the Lord met Saul, He did not speak to him again directly.
[246]  If you are not coordinated with others, you do not have to tell others; within you, you know it yourself.
[247]  But if you say that in addition to being a hand, you want to see also, you will not succeed even if you try it as long as you live.
[248]  The teachings in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew are not there to cause us to feel uncomfortable.
[249]  If you walk with others for a mile, it may make you feel uncomfortable.
[250]  If you do not have the spiritual discernment and you appoint three elders, and after three years you find out that four other people are more advanced than these three, what should you do?
[251]  THE WAY OF THE WORK TODAY Going On with the Lord
[252]  What we considered as life yesterday may be death today.
[253]  We must go on, and we must not stop at the past experiences.
[254]  What God is doing today is to raise up the testimony of the local church in the midst of desolation, to answer God's call in an age of desolation with the local church, and to recover the church out of its desolation through the testimony of the local church.
[255]  CHAPTER FORTY-ONE THE WAY OF THE CHURCH CO-WORKERS' MEETING 3
[256]  At the time of Paul, the church was already falling into desolation.
[257]  Paul said in the book of Philippians that "all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus" Phil 2:21 .
[258]  THE WAY FOR OUR WORK TODAY Realizing the Limitation of an Individual,
[259]  God has His specific demands; He wants man to learn coordination.
[260]  God not only requires that man be delivered from sin, the world, and the flesh; He also asks that man be delivered from his individualism.
[261]  Since the Reformation, man came to think that he can be a Christian individually, that he can be sanctified individually, justified individually, and work and serve God individually.
[262]  A minister cannot speak in a loose way, nor can he demand that others submit to him all the time without himself being first dealt with by the Lord.
[263]  God will never entrust His authority to such kinds of people.
[264]  If a man has a natural liking to put his hands on others' business, God will not be able to use such a person.
[265]  If God wanted to control anything, He could remove the tree of knowledge of good and evil, or He could put a fence around the tower of Babel.
[266]  It means that one is willing to submit to the authority that God has put upon a person.
[267]  The gospel spread from Jerusalem to Samaria, and then to the ends of the earth.
[268]  At the same time, it would be equally wrong if all the believers were to remain in Jerusalem, for the intention of the Lord was that the gospel would be preached to the ends of the earth.
[269]  The problem today is that we do not have a Jerusalem, and we do not have an Antioch.
[270]  If we do not do this, the work will belong to the local church again, and the Lord will have no way to go on among us.
[271]  CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE KINGDOM THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE 1
[272]  In the New Testament, the first thing that the Lord wants is the kingdom of God, or the kingdom of the heavens.
[273]  As far as its having to do with God is concerned, it is the kingdom of God, and as far as its having to do with the heavens is concerned, it is the kingdom of the heavens.
[274]  In the past, we thought that the kingdom is a matter of reward.
[275]  If this is the case, who can enter the kingdom?
[276]  The Lord answered, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible" Matt 19:25, 26 .
[277]  After the arbitration, they may be reconciled with each other for a while, and may agree with one another that they will henceforth not exercise their flesh, but will instead pray and confess their sins one to the other, and that by the grace of God they will no longer lose their temper.
[278]  THE DEFICIENCY OF THE REFORMATION A. The Recovery of Faith
[279]  In addition to him, there were others like Evan Hopkins of England and Theodore Monod of France.
[280]  Consecration is not simply a kind of exchange, in which we offer to God all we have and all we are, and we take back from Him what He has and what He is.
[281]  THE RECOVERY OF THE REALITY OF THE KINGDOM The Welsh Revival
[282]  Let us go on to one more subject, the kingdom.
[283]  The kingdom is a common subject, but to merely discuss the term "kingdom" is useless.
[284]  About 1930, Brother T. Austin-Sparks went on further to see the Body.
[285]  If enough brothers and sisters would take the ground of God's absolute salvation and consecrate themselves fully to the Lord right after they are saved, and they would hand themselves over fully, the church will find the power and the authority to testify for the Lord and will bring others to the proper stand from the first day on.
[286]  In order to arrive at this recovery, God requires that there be the manifestation of authority among us.
[287]  If in the church today three or five people, or thirty or fifty people, know the will of God, and I do not have the right judgment concerning certain matters or persons, is it not better that I take their judgment than to make a judgment myself?
[288]  If we do not have any spiritual reality, Catholicism will indeed come in. But if spiritual reality is with us, we will realize that no matter how good our personal judgments may be, they can never be compared to the judgments of those with spiritual discernment in the Body.
[289]  Today we have to learn to submit to God's authority.
[290]  We have to see that the whole problem rests with us today.
[291]  We have to realize how great our responsibility is.
[292]  Because of our unfaithfulness, we dare not preach the complete gospel to the sinners.
[293]  You must be a transformed person before you can preach a transforming gospel.
[294]  If we are not a certain type of person, we can never preach that certain type of gospel.
[295]  If God gains His way through us, those who are saved after us will not be like the saved ones we see today; a better breed will emerge.
[296]  There are certain things concerning consecration that are difficult to speak about.
[297]  According to the Bible, there is no such thing as an unconsecrated saved one.
[298]  When the eyes see, it is actually not the eyes that are seeing, but the head that sees.
[299]  When the limbs move, they are not the ones that are moving, but it is the head that is moving.
[300]  We must see the Body life before we can consider the question of the church in Antioch.
[301]  For this reason, before we discuss the question of Antioch, we must first have some make-up lessons.
[302]  However, if there is not the reality of the Holy Spirit, instead only approval by vote, planning, and resolutions in our work, what we have will be more than central organizations; it will be Roman Catholicism.
[303]  The Catholics say that there is only one church, that their priests are the only kind of people who can understand the Bible, and that their church is the only true church.
[304]  The starting point of the work in Antioch was the sending forth of two or three men.
[305]  However, if workers are sent out by the work, the question of organization may come in. When we are having our gathering this time, brothers from different localities have come on their own accord.
[306]  He will lead us to the point where we will not be able to go on or even to live if we do not take the way of the Body.
[307]  Today we cannot make the truth concerning the local churches a method.
[308]  If we make it a method, it will become very dead indeed.
[309]  There is a big difference between a proper salvation and an improper salvation.
[310]  One woman can give birth to a twelve-ounce baby, whereas another can give birth to a twelve-pound baby.
[311]  The church should bear the responsibility in its ministry to help the new ones to have a good beginning.
[312]  There is a great difference between the way taken by those who have a proper beginning and those who do not.
[313]  We must be a certain kind of person before we can produce that kind of person.
[314]  If what a person has are the things of God, what others will sense in him will only be the things of God.
[315]  THE NEED TODAY A. Committing Oneself to the Body
[316]  I see clearly that with our present condition, we need a second salvation.
[317]  I do not wish that it be taken by others and used as a standard terminology.
[318]  Today, if a man wants to hand himself over willingly, he has to do it; and if he does not want to hand himself over, he nevertheless has to do it.
[319]  Let us also consider a little the principles of offering.
[320]  AND THE RECOVERY OF AUTHORITY CO-WORKERS' MEETING 7
[321]  Brother Nee: In the past, there were many things that we could not say or do.
[322]  This time, when over twenty brothers handed themselves over to us, I told them that now I am not afraid even to take off my hat to ask for money from others.
[323]  There are two reasons why the supply among the brothers and sisters in the local churches is little.
[324]  The first is that there are works of the flesh, and the second is that the saints have not learned the lesson of submitting to the authority in the church.
[325]  Because there is the flesh, the responsible brothers are hesitant to let these fleshly ones function, for fear that they will do more damage than good.
[326]  When all the dumb ones open their mouths, when all the brothers and sisters speak, and when all the one-talented ones are functioning, we have the church.
[327]  There is only one mouth in the human body.
[328]  We have to let the rich ones and those in high positions see that the church does not beg for their services.
[329]  But we have to let them see that the reason we allow them to serve is for perfecting them and edifying them.
[330]  We have to help those saints who occupy high positions to step down from their heights and to open up their wallets, so that God can edify all.
[331]  Our work today is one in which we perfect others to do the work themselves.
[332]  If one day the whole church rises up to do everything by itself, to have the whole church preaching the gospel and the whole church edifying each other, that will be the day when the world will see the church doing a new thing on earth.
[333]  AND THE WHOLE BODY SERVING CO-WORKERS' MEETING 8
[334]  Brother Chang Yu-chi asked: What is the relationship between submitting to the authority in the Body and personal submission before God?
[335]  The Catholic church thinks that all God's leadings come through the church and that a man cannot come to God directly, but must come to Him through the church.
[336]  In the same principle, it is not by outward teachings, but by the anointing that we come to know what is of God and what is not of Him.
[337]  If we are not careful, and if we generalize these leadings to mean all kinds of leadings and conclude that all kinds of leadings come directly and independently from God, we will have a problem.
[338]  The book of Acts is a book on the leading concerning the way in the service.
[339]  In God's work, we have to learn to accept the corporate leadings.
[340]  I am not saying that there are no more individual leadings of the Lord, nor am I saying that corporate leadings today can never be wrong.
[341]  But we can ask ourselves: Do we have leadings in our individual works, and have we ever made any mistakes in those leadings?
[342]  If you know that a young one has done something that you know is wrong, and if through the lack of learning the proper lesson, you dare not speak to him, you are allowing him to perpetuate his mistakes.
[343]  If you say that you are going to be a preacher and your father insists that you apply for a job in the Customs Department, you cannot argue with him or lose your temper by breaking dishes and cups around the house.
[344]  The principle of service in the church is that all the one-talented ones have to rise up.
[345]  Brother Witness Lee asked: 1 What are the difference and relationship between the coordination in the Body, the coordination among the co-workers, and the coordination among the brothers and sisters?
[346]  2 Is coordination merely a matter of following the ministers, or is there something else?
[347]  Brother Nee answered: For all the time that the church has been on this earth, God never asks man to direct the church.
[348]  God never asks a few more advanced ones to direct a church.
[349]  We have to see that if the one-talented ones do not rise up to serve, there is no way for the church to go on.
[350]  Many people think that the matter of service is the work of a few people, but true service is that in which the whole Body is involved.
[351]  God desires that the church today be the kingdom of priests.
[352]  My co-worker brothers, no matter how prevailing your ministry is, how many gifts you have, and how useful and strong you are, as long as you replace others' service, you are a Nicolaitan!
[353]  Even if you are a so-called spiritual giant or a revival evangelist, if you do not bring in the service of the whole Body, whatever you do, you are a failure.
[354]  CHAPTER FORTY-NINE THE TREASURE IN THE EARTHEN VESSEL
[355]  AND THE PRINCIPLE OF JERUSALEM CO-WORKERS' MEETING 9
[356]  Today men are not natural enough before God; they want to be "improved" earthen vessels.
[357]  But it does not matter how much an earthen vessel is improved, for improvement only produces one result: to draw others' attention to itself.
[358]  Natural naivety and spiritual simplicity are two different things.
[359]  The more a person knows the Lord, the simpler he is.
[360]  A fleshly person does not have much within him, and what he has outwardly is more than what he has inwardly.
[361]  Today we need to consider afresh the principle of Jerusalem.
[362]  If we are clear about the principle just mentioned, there is no problem with the practice.
[363]  If the co-workers will first drop their personal works and will come together in Jerusalem, the Lord will have a way.
[364]  The principle of the work is not to replace others, but to work along with three or five others.
[365]  If we want to see the work in Shanghai built up, we have to put all the brothers and sisters here into function.
[366]  If the truth is not something absolute for you, you do not know God, and you do not know God's word.
[367]  What does it mean to say that the truth is absolute?
[368]  If we can take the truth as the unique standard, and if we have the courage to say that since the Lord has done such-and-such a thing, we admit that we are wrong, new light will come, and a new way will be opened to us.
[369]  Brother Tang asked: What is the relationship between the members and the Body?
[370]  Some people like to assume headship apart from Christ.
[371]  As far as the nature of the work goes, there is the need to resume the literature work.
[372]  We hope that there can be the following publications:
[373]  Lord, the more we fellowship with You, the more we feel that we are filthy and defiled.
[374]  Brother Suen answered that we have to not love our life unto the death.
[375]  If some brothers and sisters will exercise themselves to give a third or even half of their time to the Lord, not for serving as a preacher, but in the way of presenting their bodies, God will be able to take great strides among us.
[376]  FOR HIS CORPORATE EXPRESSION THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE 2
[377]  Prayer: Lord, unless the Holy Spirit brings these words into the depths of our spirit, what we speak is vain.
[378]  God not only dwells in the heavens or among men, but also within man Eph 3:17 .
[379]  Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:15-16 THE CHURCH GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH God's Intention Dwelling in Man
[380]  Brother Witness Lee:God is God from eternity to eternity.
[381]  The church is the enlargement of the principle of Christ, which is God living in man, becoming man's content, and expressing Himself through man.
[382]  If we read carefully from Genesis to Revelation, we can see that God has only one desire to gain a group of people to be His habitation.
[383]  AND THE WAY OF THE WORK CO-WORKERS' MEETING 11
[384]  We think that we are first the members and then become a Body after we are joined together at baptism.
[385]  If you do not like to be a member, you are nevertheless a member.
[386]  THE WAY OF THE CHURCH AND THE WAY OF THE WORK
[387]  Brother Witness Lee asked: What is the difference between the way of the church and the way of the co-workers?
[388]  Before the Lord, what we see is not just what we have right now.
[389]  Another matter we have to take care of is the edification of the new believers.
[390]  The more we go on, the more we are clear about the things that a Christian ought to have.
[391]  If we do not do this, we will not know how the other churches are doing, and we will not know whether they are doing well or not doing well.
[392]  CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR MONEY AND OCCUPATIONS CO-WORKERS' MEETING 12
[393]  Consecration is not simply for us to hand ourselves over to the Lord, but for us to hand ourselves over to the church.
[394]  A man cannot say on the one hand that he is learning to serve God, while holding on to money on the other hand.
[395]  The Lord has no intention that we serve Him while engaging in some money-making occupation.
[396]  I hope that we can offer up ourselves and our occupations to God for the accomplishment of His purpose.
[397]  Brother Lee: Since the end of 1942, I saw clearly that unless the problem with money is solved, there is no way for the gospel of God to go out effectively.
[398]  We have to see today that we are not our own and that our possessions are also not our own.
[399]  Some people should consecrate themselves for the gospel, whereas others should offer up themselves in their occupations.
[400]  Outwardly, you may be managing your own business, but in reality and spiritually, you are doing everything for the church.
[401]  If you earn ten thousand dollars, and you spend it all on yourself, you do not need the church to rise up to condemn you; you will condemn yourself.
[402]  If you ask what we should do if some decide to take back their consecration when they hear this kind of words, I would say that we are not afraid of anyone taking back his consecration.
[403]  If I say that I will treat you with a meal, the northerners will think that they will have wheat rolls, the southerners will think that they will have rice, the westerners will think that they will have bread, while the poor people will think that they will have corn.
[404]  What we want is first you, and then yours.
[405]  I am a priest, and I live for God.
[406]  If a man does not hand himself over, it is meaningless to receive a few dollars from him; it is better to return such money back to him.
[407]  The purpose of this meeting is to share with the majority of the brothers and sisters the things that we, the co-workers, have been discussing for the last few days.
[408]  Many people do not realize that, on the one hand, the church is in desolation and that, on the other hand, the church is advancing.
[409]  The condition at the beginning was very different from what it is today.
[410]  We cannot live on earth as if the church has never been degraded.
[411]  After the recovery already mentioned, God raised up another group of people, men like J. N. Darby, and so forth.
[412]  We can say that there has never been a time when the church was as clear and as rich as it is today.
[413]  In the Old Testament, there are two types: one is the tabernacle, and the other is the temple.
[414]  Many people can speak on the tabernacle; there are at least one hundred books on this subject.
[415]  The tabernacle in the wilderness typifies the condition of the church on earth, and the temple in the kingdom typifies the eternal condition of the church before God.
[416]  As for those occupations that contain elements of danger or temptations, we have to give them up.
[417]  Brother Lee: For many years, God's blessings have been among us; they have never left us.
[418]  Brother Nee answered: Brother Chu said something once: "If I hand something over to the Body, I do not have to take care of it any longer.
[419]  If you merely say with your mouth that you are serving God, nobody knows when you have stopped this service.
[420]  Today, I ask Brother Nee to forgive me for all my past attitudes and words.
[421]  I was sympathetic toward Brother Nee's venture into business.
[422]  REQUIREMENTS OF A WORKER A Proper and Pure Spirit
[423]  One brother asked: When is it the time to say, "Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth" 1 Sam 3:9 ?
[424]  Brother Nee answered: In the past, the brothers in all the localities gave the co-workers quite a lot of headaches.
[425]  CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATIONS 2 CO-WORKERS' MEETING 15
[426]  Brother Hsu Yung-ming from Hangchow: If we do not take the first step now, we will have no spiritual future.
[427]  Brother Chi Yung-tung testified: After I heard Brother Nee's words, untold tears were flowing within me.
[428]  I was brought into the responsibility of the work through our brother.
[429]  When I left my job in 1928, I had five children, and I was in debt.
[430]  But what the Lord has given me today is so much richer than what I had.
[431]  The Lord is responsible for meeting His demands, because whatever comes from God, God Himself will be responsible for fulfilling it.
[432]  Once a person touches the Body, he feels happy.
[433]  One day I was on a ship, and I did not see any brother.
[434]  The Body is not a teaching; it is a life.
[435]  Anyone who acts contrary to the demand of this life will not feel comfortable or be at ease.
[436]  This life not only demands that we love and be patient; it also demands that we behave as Body Christians.
[437]  FOR THE SERVICE IN THE BODY CO-WORKERS' MEETING 17
[438]  No matter how many souls you have saved or how much work you have done, if you are not in the Body, you will not be satisfied with your service.
[439]  If I do not hand myself over, but instead I study and pursue after spirituality by myself, I will end up in poverty.
[440]  We should hand over ourselves to God, and we should hand over ourselves to the church.
[441]  The Church Supplying All the Needs of the Saints 2.
[442]  On the practical side, the principle is that after a person offers up himself, the church naturally will not bother him concerning his personal life and his career.
[443]  You do not have to get permission from the church concerning whether you should eat Chinese food or Western food, or what you should wear and eat, and how you should live and travel.
[444]  In this way, even if you should become cold in two years, and you do not want to give yourselves to the church any longer, the church will not have to go after you.
[445]  CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE THE SERVICE OF THE WHOLE BODY CO-WORKERS' MEETING 18
[446]  However, God's word says that everyone who belongs to God is a servant of God.
[447]  for the Church to Be a Kingdom of Priests
[448]  At the end of the New Testament, in A.D. 95, when John was about to die, he said that we have been made "a kingdom, priests to His God and Father" Rev 1:6 . God's intention toward the church today is for everyone to be a priest.
[449]  Last year I asked a student at the Chiao-tung University how he would feel if someone were to hit him on his right cheek.
[450]  If someone hit your right cheek, you would be angry when you go home.
[451]  I am showing you that you are a servant of God.
[452]  We have to tell the young brothers and sisters that whatever they do in the future, whether they will be a teacher or a doctor, they can only do it as a secondary occupation.
[453]  Every one of us lives for the purpose of serving God.
[454]  It is because without offering up our possessions, we can never serve God.
[455]  The Lord says that a man cannot serve two masters; he cannot serve God and mammon at the same time Matt 6:24 .
[456]  If we want to serve God, we have to serve Him in a desperate way.
[457]  THE NEED IN SERVICE AND THE WAY OF SERVICE
[458]  If I had a hundred billion dollars today, I could distribute it all to the proper use within a few days.
[459]  If we do not believe in a thorough gospel, and if we do not have a thorough consecration, it will be difficult for the Lord to use us.
[460]  AND BEARING THE CROSS THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE 3
[461]  Lord, if You want to receive a better worship from us, we ask that You do a deeper work within us.
[462]  CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE THINGS THAT A CO-WORKER SHOULD
[463]  If we fellowship with a weak brother, we have to help him, instead of falling into the same situation that he is in. What we have to do today is to pull him up to another level.
[464]  In contacting others, one has to watch out if his standing changes with the acquaintance.
[465]  Brother Chang Kwang-yung asked again: Sometimes after I deliver a message, I feel hungry, and good food is placed before me.
[466]  I believe that God is going to do great things today, and I believe that God has done something great already.
[467]  First Corinthians 12 and Romans 12 show us that in God's arrangement or plan, there is no such thing as one pastor monopolizing the service of the whole Body.
[468]  Concerning the perfecting of the new believers, we also have to do it as a Body.
[469]  In serving the Lord, on the one hand, the brothers and sisters have to learn to be obedient and to take the cross.
[470]  On the other hand, the authority of the church needs to be recovered; this deals with the flesh and deals with those who will not take the cross.
[471]  In order for the work of the church to be recovered, there is first the need for the recovery of the one-talented ones.
[472]  In order to recover the work of the church, there must also be the recovery of the authority of the church.
[473]  It is not enough to recover the one-talented ones alone, and it is not enough to recover the authority of the church alone.
[474]  If God will do this work among us, we will see an unprecedented work of salvation among us.
[475]  According to our disposition, we do things when we feel like doing them, and we go home and sleep when we do not feel like doing them.
[476]  However, in the Body today, whether you like it or not, you have to do what you should do.
[477]  After the brothers and sisters are trained, they can be sent out.
[478]  The apostles are the ones who should remain in Jerusalem.
[479]  If you withstand Satan in an inward way, you do not know whether or not the withstanding works.
[480]  But if you say a few words, Satan will go away.
[481]  At the same time, money is taking hold of all things.
[482]  The Bible never says that a servant of God should do something "when he feels amen to do it," and should not do something "when he does not feel amen to do it."
[483]  Even if you are a great gift or a strong member, you are useless if you are not in coordination, and if you are not the eyes, surely you need coordination all the more.
[484]  Brother Witness Lee asked: How does a person know what kind of ministry he has?
[485]  Whether or not you have a ministry is up to the Head to know; it is not up to you to know.
[486]  If you have a ministry, you have it, and it will be manifested through your exercising it.
[487]  If we know God, we will see that a person may say something, but this does not mean that he is what he says.
[488]  Only after we become a person who has no interest in interfering with others' affairs can we be the authority; only then can we bear responsibility before God, and only then can we manage the affairs of the brothers and sisters.
[489]  Yet up to a certain point, he said that he had the confidence that he had the Spirit of God v. 40 . Paul said that he gave the brothers his own opinion.
[490]  It was as if he was saying that he had followed the Lord for twelve years, and that according to him the matter should be taken care of in such and such a way.
[491]  If you say that you are the Body, yet you do not submit to the authority of the Head, what you say is false.
[492]  A piece of glass may hold a little bit of water, but it can never hold the equivalent of a cup of water.
[493]  Every Christian has received some grace, but individual Christians are not the whole.
[494]  During the time of the apostles, the disciples gave up everything to follow the Lord.
[495]  In church history, there were tens of thousands of Franciscans who chose to live in poverty.
[496]  If you would not misunderstand me, I would say why not do it one more time and be a little bit too much in consecration.
[497]  Giving to the Poor for the Purpose of Being Delivered from the Power of Mammon
[498]  Today, some people are bound by the world, but the bondage of money is more serious than the bondage of the world.
[499]  Why do we have to give to the poor?
[500]  When I was staying in London, everything was set up by the host.
[501]  TO BROTHER K. H. WEIGH CO-WORKERS' MEETING 24
[502]  If a worker cannot express to others the one Christ whom God desires to present, his work is a failure.
[503]  CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE BROKENNESS AND MINISTRY CO-WORKERS' MEETING 25
[504]  Never think that as long as you say the right thing and the proper words, you will be all right.
[505]  There is another question: whether the words you say come from your outward man or your inward man.
[506]  The Need for the Strongest Point to Be Broken
[507]  The nose is the most conspicuous part of the human body.
[508]  If a man bumps into the wall, the first thing that hits it is his nose.
[509]  For many people, when they express themselves, the strongest and most obvious things that come across to others are their cleverness or their thoughts.
[510]  In order for a person to serve the Lord, the strongest part of his outward man must be broken.
[511]  But you cannot say that for all these years, you have not received the discipline of the Holy Spirit.
[512]  One day, when you receive God's mercy, you will be able to say that at last you understand what it is to be a broken man.
[513]  The life that all the believers receive is a rich life.
[514]  Yet we do not realize how rich this life is.
[515]  It is only when our outward shell is broken that we realize how rich the Lord's life is, and how it can achieve things that we cannot achieve.
[516]  CHAPTER SEVENTY REPORT ON THE WORK 1 CO-WORKERS' MEETING 26
[517]  Although we cannot say that we are absolutely clear today, when the few responsible brothers came together, we felt that we should begin our work from the coastal regions.
[518]  We have to say something about the training in Foochow.
[519]  Our work in the past had certain problems; we did not produce "standard" Christians.
[520]  In this way, some brothers and sisters have been Christians for over eight or ten years, yet they still do not know the basic truths.
[521]  There are four magazines that need to be recovered.
[522]  The first is The Christian, and we ask Brother Witness Lee to be responsible for it.
[523]  We expect to see the whole church rising up to preach the gospel, and all the brothers and sisters serving God together, rather than three or five people serving by themselves.
[524]  You have to say to such brothers, "No. Now that you realize that it is a gospel meeting, you have to rise up immediately, because you have a part in this meeting."
[525]  If you want to spend all your money and do not want it to become a hindrance to you, the way is very simple; all you have to do is to catch the time of a church revival and go to the Lord and offer up all you have.
[526]  First, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the gospel work...Second, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the gospel visitation work...Third, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the new believers' meetings...
[527]  We still have some announcements to make concerning other matters.
[528]  For those brothers who are holding jobs and for those students who are still in school, we ask that they would not drop their present occupation.
[529]  When you receive some light from the Lord, we hope that you will make adjustments according to the light you receive.
[530]  If we preach the gospel well, and if all the brothers and sisters are coordinated together, our homes, our occupation, and our money will all be for the gospel.
[531]  Date:10:00 a.m., The Lord's Day, May 2, 1948
[532]  If you see your own sins, and if you know that the Lord can deliver you out of your sins, and you call on Him, He will surely save you.
[533]  In order to believe in the Lord, the first thing we have to do is to see the Lord, and the second thing we have to do is to receive Him.
[534]  If you come to see Him, and if you receive Him, He will come and live in your heart.
[535]  CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO REPORT ON THE WORK 2 CO-WORKERS' MEETING 27
[536]  Date:3:00 p.m., The Lord's Day, May 2, 1948
[537]  But in the future, we will not have to tell the saved ones to hand over themselves; by that time, they will not be able to be a Christian if they do not hand over themselves the first day.
[538]  The brothers and sisters should know that their future, their jobs, occupations, dwellings, businesses, possessions, and everything that forms a part of their living should be put in the fellowship of the church.
[539]  Now, if he is to take the service of God as his center, everyone has to take one great step forward.
[540]  If you make ten million dollars a month, and you need all ten million, you do not have to offer a cent. If you make only eight million, the church will gladly give up two million to make up enough to meet your need.
[541]  Brother Miao said that he has been to many places and that nowhere is the meeting hall as bad as the one here in Shanghai.
[542]  All the local brothers and sisters can put their offerings into the church offering box.
[543]  If anyone wants to inquire about the accounting of the money for the work, you can go to Brother Lee and Brother Tang.
[544]  If any money is designated for the work, it should be sent to Brother Witness and Brother Tang if the money comes from the north, and should be sent to Brother Chen Keh-san and Chen Si-wen if the money comes from the south.
[545]  Before God, there are principles to everything we do, and we cannot do anything in a loose way.
[546]  Today, if we send all the co-workers left behind in Shanghai to the campuses, it will not be enough to meet the need of the three universities alone.
[547]  I venture to say that it is not suitable for the co-workers here in Shanghai to go to Foochow.
[548]  In Chiao-tung University, National Medical University, and Shanghai Medical University alone, we have enough work to do already.
[549]  CHAPTER SEVENTY-THREE A PRAYER FOR THE GOSPEL CHURCH PRAYER MEETING 1
[550]  At that time we did not have the freedom to preach the gospel, and we prayed that if You were to have mercy on us and would give us another opportunity, we would surely preach the gospel properly.
[551]  Tonight, we have something to say to those brothers who are engaged in business and who have handed over themselves.
[552]  We have gathered together these brothers who have handed over themselves in order to have some fellowship with you.
[553]  The money you earn is for God, and the money I earn is also for God.
[554]  Brother Nee said: According to statistics compiled by evangelists around the world, the more money a person puts into the gospel work, the more people there are who will be baptized.
[555]  They calculated that on an average a person has to spend one thousand U.S. dollars on a person before he can be saved.
[556]  Although I cannot say that of one thousand people saved among us, every one of them counts, I can say that at least nine hundred ninety-nine of them count.
[557]  CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE CONCERNING CONTENDING OR YIELDING CHURCH PRAYER MEETING 2
[558]  One brother asked: What should be our relationship with our family: Should we contend with them, or should we yield to them?
[559]  Brother Witness Lee: Concerning the disposal of money that you have handed over, you should not insist on doing anything if your wife, children, or parents raise objections to it.
[560]  You cannot measure others by your own spiritual standard, and you cannot require others to be the same as you are.
[561]  Prayer: Lord, help us not only to remove the world, sin, and the flesh, but help us not to come with our mind or our will.
[562]  THE REASON FOR NOT BEING TRANSPARENT A. Not Living by the Spirit
[563]  What is the reason for God's children not being transparent?
[564]  Within every saved person's spirit, there is the life of God.
[565]  The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord Prov 20:27 ; it allows God to shine forth, in the same way that the light bulb allows electricity to shine forth.
[566]  If a man does not live in the spirit after he is saved, but instead lives outside the spirit, and if while he is living, he does not live by the spirit, he will not have the light, and he will not be transparent.
[567]  THE WAY TO BE TRANSPARENT A. Not Trusting in the Mind or the Thoughts,
[568]  We must always learn to touch God in our spirit.
[569]  Today, God is Spirit, and we have to learn to reject our own thoughts and to exercise ourselves to live in the spirit.
[570]  If you try to touch God with your head, you will not touch Him even if you break your skull.
[571]  For example, before you go to see a brother, you should learn to have some fellowship with the Lord within you.
[572]  All spiritual persons are people with strong emotions, but, at the same time, all spiritual persons are those who do not live by their emotions.
[573]  Those of you who do not have emotion have to learn to have emotion; you have to learn to laugh and to weep.
[574]  If Nanking develops a problem with Shanghai, that is, if the church in Nanking is at odds with the church in Shanghai, you can only say that they are maintaining a local testimony; they have not maintained God's testimony on earth.
[575]  Brother Witness Lee asked: What is the authority of the church, and who can represent the church?
[576]  Brother Nee answered: The authority of the local church is in the hands of the elders, whereas the authority of the work is in the hands of the apostles.
[577]  While I am taking care of the matter, the church is brought in; the reality of the church is brought in. Of course, in terms of the actual procedure, the church is not involved.
[578]  Here we can see a unique fact of oneness: An individual can have the authority of the church, two or three can also have the authority of the church, and the whole church can also have the authority of the church.
[579]  One brother asked: Brother Nee said a while ago that an individual brother can be one with the church, and that once there is oneness, there is authority.
[580]  Strictly speaking, not only can one individual not call himself the church; even if all sixteen hundred saints in Shanghai are put together, it is equally presumptuous for them to call themselves the church.
[581]  If I am one who has been disciplined by the Holy Spirit and one who has learned the lesson of fellowship, and if I am one who rejects not only the self, but all individualism, and if I am one who has been dealt with in all these areas, then I will surely be one with the church.
[582]  If not, even if you have sixteen hundred people, you cannot say that you are the church.
[583]  Brother Yu Cheng-hwa asked: Is this identification the result of the work of the Holy Spirit?
[584]  Why do we not say that we should be identified with the Head, but rather that we should be identified with the Body?
[585]  For example, if the feeling within me is different from yours, we will not be the same no matter how much we try to talk things over with one another.
[586]  CHAPTER SEVENTY-NINE A TRANSPARENT PERSON 2 THE LORD'S DAY MORNING MESSAGE 6
[587]  Last Lord's Day, at the end of the message, we mentioned the matter of avoiding right and wrong, but we did not explain the matter clearly.
[588]  If you consider the matter from the angle of right and wrong, you will immediately fall into darkness, and you will not be shining and transparent.
[589]  The Bible only tells us that life is light.
[590]  It never says that right and wrong are light.
[591]  You have to realize that not only is criticizing others sin, but it is something that will lead you into something else; it will lead you into good and evil, and right and wrong.
