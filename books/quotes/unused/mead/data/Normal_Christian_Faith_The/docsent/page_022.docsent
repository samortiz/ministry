   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SON AND THE FATHER ARE ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What did Jesus of Nazareth say about Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 10:30 He said, "I and the Father are one."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need some explanation here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible the invisible God is called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Son manifests and expresses the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is hidden is the Father, and what is expressed is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Son is the One who can be seen and touched.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Behind, you have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In front, you have the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The two are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are the two sides of the same reality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we talk about two, we refer to the fact that one is hidden while the other is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we talk about one, we say that the revealed One is just the hidden One in manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the biblical interpretation of the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, when Jesus of Nazareth one day said, "I and the Father are one," it was a statement that no one else could make.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This man was saying in reality that He and the invisible God are one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is God and God is He.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is the invisible Father, and He is the manifested Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Father and the Son are one!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who can this One be that made such a claim?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is He a madman?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is He out to deceive us?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After Jesus spoke such a word, what reaction do we see?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"The Jews again took up stones that they might stone Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these works are you stoning Me?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Jews answered Him, We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>31-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Jews understood very well that Jesus' words meant that He claimed to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After hearing these words they wanted to stone Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A claim was made by Jesus, and an accusation was charged by the Jews, both of which concerned His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Was Jesus insane?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Did He speak pure nonsense just to cause people to kill Him?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Or was He a swindler setting up some kind of a scheme?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If so, what was He trying to gain?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Was He trying to gain death?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE SON EXPRESSES THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps we will go back a little bit to the earlier parts in the Gospel of John and see what it says there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John 1:18 says, "No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why has no one seen God?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is because God is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jesus said that He was the only Begotten of the Father; He expressed the invisible Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you see the only Begotten, you see the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Again He spoke concerning Himself, "And no one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven" 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Have you ever heard anyone say such words?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I cannot say, "No one has been to Shanghai, but he who comes from Shanghai to Tientsin, even I, Watchman Nee, who is in Shanghai."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I say so, I would be gibbering nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But Jesus was speaking a heavenly language.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He said that He came out of heaven and is still in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What can a person be if he can be in two places simultaneously?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Either he is God or he is a lunatic or he is a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you have not yet believed in Christ, please give a verdict to this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who is this man?</S>
