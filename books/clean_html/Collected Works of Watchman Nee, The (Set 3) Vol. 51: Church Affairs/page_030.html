<h2 class="head2">The Way of the Church</h2><h2 class="head3">Working Replacing Listening to Messages</h2><p>I believe that the way of the church is as follows: Save and gain a person from outside, and after he is saved, immediately put him into the work so as not to produce the habit of listening to messages on the Lord's Day. We need to change to the habit of working on the Lord's Day. I believe that our failure over these ten years will be completely changed from today. In these ten years we have taught that it is right for the saints to have the habit of listening to messages on the Lord's Day; we have not replaced it with something. We did not substitute preaching with working on the Lord's Day. Today we have found that working on the Lord's Day is what should be done and what is proper. Because our practice has not been proper, that which is wrong has come in.</p><h2 class="head3">The Entire Body Being Mobilized<br />to Preach the Gospel</h2><p>If the churches in every locality cause all the one-talented members to rise up and to stand and work, it is very possible that we can return to the situation of the early church. The Lord's Day mornings should be used to preach the gospel. The Lord's Day is the time for everyone to be mobilized to save people. You have to gather the new believers and let them know that every Lord's Day is the day on which all of us are busy. We must preach the gospel every Lord's Day.</p><p>No doubt the church on the earth needs to be fed. I believe in feeding, and I also believe that in China there is no one who believes in feeding as I do. However, I admit that the mission of the church on the earth is not feeding but the preaching of the gospel. Therefore, we need to use every Lord's Day for the preaching of the gospel, whether in the morning or in the afternoon, but especially in the morning because this is the time when everyone everywhere "goes to worship.'' We will have a message meeting every Lord's Day morning, but it will be for the gospel.</p><p>All of the brothers must go out to lead people to the meeting. We can also have advertisements, but we do not stress this. We can use other methods, but we should stress the need for one to invite two and another to invite four. By working in this way, we will immediately see that all will be busy, because all the brothers and sisters will be preaching the gospel and saving people. We should not only do this on the Lord's Day, but we must go to seek out people and talk with them at other times, and we must also bring them to hear the gospel and seek out new ones to come and listen. If we bring many people, we will have to find others to help care for them. This kind of work in the care of the gospel is the primary work of the brothers and sisters.</p><p>If we lead people to believe and be saved every Lord's Day, it will not be long before the brothers' habit of listening to messages will be gone. Then the true nature of the church will be manifested. Who are the ones called church members? They are those who listen to messages on the Lord's Day. But after a period of time, their nature will be changed. Eventually, everyone who goes out to preach the gospel and save people will be called a church member. He who actively goes out to save people will be called a church member, a Christian. There will no longer be a passive habit of listening to messages.</p><h2 class="head2">The Whole Church Being Priests</h2><p>You must see what the church is. I believe the light is very clear now: The church is everyone being a priest. This type of universal priesthood has been preached for more than a hundred years. From 1828 until today, a period of one hundred twenty years, the eyes of God's servants have been opened to see that the priesthood is universal. However, even today the priesthood is still not widespread. The church is the Body of Christ. The recovery of this testimony has been going on for more than one hundred years. Of course, within the last ten or more years some have especially seen its spiritual weight. However, in the church it is very possible that the Body of Christ is still merely a doctrine. In actuality we are far from bringing it into the church life.</p><h2 class="head3">Every Member Functioning</h2><p>Therefore, you need to ask God to open your eyes to cause you to know what the Body is. The Body is every member functioning. In the body there is not one member that does not function; likewise, there is not one person who belongs to the Lord who is not a priest serving the Lord. All the members function. All the priests serve.</p>
