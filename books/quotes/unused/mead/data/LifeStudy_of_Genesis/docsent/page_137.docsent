   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Concerning the Man a The Ground Growing Thorns and Thistles</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the man, the ground grows thorns and thistles Gen 3:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many of you are not farmers and may think that you can escape from the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, regardless of the kind of job or profession you may have, your job or profession is the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the whole earth there is not one job or profession that is without hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In every occupation the ground grows thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some may say then, "I will never be hired by others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I will go into business for myself."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you say this, after a few years you will not want to be in business any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You will feel like giving up your business because, instead of producing dollars, it grows thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In every kind of employment in the schools, factories, markets, and offices it seems easy for the ground to grow thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Several years ago I met a brother who is a fruit farmer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I thought that it would be wonderful to be a farmer, but the brother told me many stories about the difficulties with his farm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such difficulties are ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Young people, you must realize that this is God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God told Adam that the ground would grow thorns and thistles and that he had to suffer pain and toil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>b Sorrow, Sweat, and Labor during His Whole Life</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has said that man must endure sorrow pain , sweat, and labor during his entire life Gen 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, man must labor, sweat, and suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet, labor and suffering are a protection to fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a man is not occupied with certain labor, it is easy for him to fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All men need to be occupied with some form of labor that they may be kept from doing sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For many men labor itself is not a sufficient safeguard; they need some sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, labor along with sufferings often prevents people from doing evil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>c Returning to the Ground</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the fall God also ordained that man should not live forever, but that he should die, returning to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, this does not mean that man must perish, because God, in His dealing with man, has afforded man the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In God's dealing with both the man and the woman there are sufferings, but no necessary perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, if man will not take God's way of salvation, he surely will perish after death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Death is also a restriction that God has placed over fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Several years ago I gave a message which covered three subjects: suffering, sleeping, and dying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>None of these items seems to be good, and I do not care for any of them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I would like to be a person who never suffers, who does not need to sleep, and who lives forever.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we must understand that suffering, sleeping, and dying are restrictions upon sinful people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If Hitler were still living and were to continue living another five hundred years, he would be the greatest devil that the earth has ever seen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While I was in Manila more than twenty years ago people spoke to me about a certain evil person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I told them, "Don't be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let him be as bad as he can be.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I assure you that he cannot continue for another ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not expect him to change for the good, but I am quite certain that after ten years he will die."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Soon afterward I read in the newspaper that this person had died.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suffering restricts people, sleeping stops people, and dying terminates people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you go to Hong Kong, you will hear the Mah-Jongg playing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>None of the Mah-Jongg players like to sleep; they prefer to play Mah-Jongg day and night for seventy-two hours without resting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, after seventy-two hours there is no need for their wives to stop them; sleep conquers them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, regardless how bad a person may be, he will first be stopped by sleep and then he will be terminated by death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sleeping is a small dying, and dying is a greater sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On this earth today there is not one evil person who is one hundred and fifty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the evil ones of the past one hundred and fifty years are dead and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God has used death to clear up the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In a sense, death is a suffering for man; yet, man does not realize that it is truly God's way of protecting him.</S>
