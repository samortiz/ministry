<h2 class="head1">TO HAVE THE FULL MUTUALITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In Speaking</h2>
<p>The Christian meetings should be full of mutuality in speaking (Eph. 5:19). To fill the Christian meetings with mutuality is not very easy, but to have the mutuality is wonderful! Whether we come together with fifty, one hundred, or one hundred-fifty, everyone should function. This creates a mutuality which fills up the entire meeting. One speaks for one minute, another speaks for half a minute, another speaks for five minutes, someone may speak for eight minutes, and someone else may speak for ten minutes. By this practice of everyone speaking according to their measure, we all would produce a meeting that is full of mutuality.</p>
<p>I hope that we would improve, grow, and advance to a condition where many would speak. Some would speak for forty seconds, others for four minutes, and another for thirty minutes. We not only need the short speaking; we also need some longer speaking. There may be a meeting in which many speak in a short way and one would speak in a new, living, refreshing, and high way for perhaps forty minutes. This would be wonderful! The first chapter of Luke illustrates this. In this chapter, there are three different kinds of speaking. The record of Elizabeth&rsquo;s speaking is the shortest (vv. 42-45). Mary, the mother of Jesus, spoke for a longer time (vv. 46-55). Finally, Zachariah, full of experiences, spoke the longest (vv. 68-79). Zachariah&rsquo;s speaking in Luke 1 contains no wasted words, and it is full of riches. How long you should speak depends upon your age and experience. Your experience and knowledge of the word of God constitute the content and the length of your speaking.</p>
<p>If everyone in the meeting speaks for a short time, and the meeting is full of mutuality, the new ones who come to the meeting will be convinced (1 Cor. 14:24-25). They may be shocked at first, asking what kind of meeting this is. They may have been Christians for many years, but they may never have seen a meeting with such mutuality&mdash;with everyone speaking.</p>
<p>We should also learn not to speak lightly. We must speak with weight. Otherwise, some may say that our speaking does not have much content. Our speaking must be with content. This needs the proper learning, practice, and training; therefore, the churches should train the saints to speak with content. If we all learn to give living and weighty words whenever and wherever we speak, we will surely be welcomed by all of the churches. On the other hand, if we go to the meetings and only sit without saying anything, we will not be appreciated that much. Learn to speak, but do not speak lightly. This needs our daily practice. Every morning we should contact the Lord, reading a few verses to enjoy the Lord by enjoying His Word. We should pick up something from the Word and practice speaking the Lord the entire day. This will enrich our being, our person, and this will constitute the proper speaking. Then wherever we go, we will not only have the boldness, but also the practice and habit of speaking. If I go to visit a church and stay for a few days, I cannot refrain from speaking. I am addicted to speaking. Wherever I go, I must speak&mdash;the more, the better. Build up a habit and taste for speaking.</p>
<p>When you speak, you get the firstfruit of the benefit. While I am speaking, you get some benefit, but I get the firstfruit of the benefit. This is why I am so strong. Learn to speak. To merely listen weakens you. On the one hand, listening nourishes you. On the other hand, if you only listen to others&rsquo; speaking, it does nourish you but it does not allow you to grow. The more help you receive in this way, the more you will eventually die. We must learn to speak, speak, speak.</p>
<p>It would be marvelous if we would learn to speak every item of the contents of chapter one of this book. We can tell others, &ldquo;The Christian meeting is linked to the processed Triune God. It is linked to Christ who has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.&rdquo; We should learn to speak these things. Chapter one of this book is enough for the saints in the churches to speak on for one year, day by day and in every meeting. The contents of all my writings are embodied in this chapter. The husbands should speak concerning these things to their wives and the wives to their husbands. I have been speaking concerning God&rsquo;s economy and the processed Triune God for nearly twenty-five years in the United States, and I have not yet exhausted this subject. Speaking concerning the Triune God is like cooking American beef in many different ways. The beef is the same, but the ways of cooking and serving it are many. Learn to speak concerning the processed Christ all the time. In other words, learn to speak the same thing all the time (1 Cor. 1:10). In order to fill the meeting with mutuality, the primary thing is speaking. When everyone speaks, the meeting is always full of mutuality.</p>
