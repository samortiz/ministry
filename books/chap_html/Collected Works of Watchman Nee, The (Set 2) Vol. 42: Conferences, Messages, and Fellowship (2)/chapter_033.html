<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">TALKS</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 23, 1936, evening<br />Place: Foochow</h1><p>We want to concentrate our fellowship this time on the following things: (1) the nature of our testimony, (2) God's will in the Bible concerning the ground of the church, the responsibility of the workers, the local assemblies, the responsibility of the local brothers, and the responsibility of the elders, and (3) the work in Foochow and the question of the co-workers.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF OUR WORK</h2><p>Let us first look at Acts 13 and 14. The basis of Acts 13 and 14 is the Lord's charge to the disciples to preach the gospel to the uttermost part of the earth (1:8). The disciples did not obey this charge. At the time of Pentecost, the disciples were in Jerusalem, and the gospel remained only in Jerusalem. Because the disciples did not go out to spread the gospel, the Lord allowed many persecutions to come to force them to leave (8:1). The spreading in Jerusalem, Samaria, and Caesarea cannot be considered as the proper pattern of gospel preaching. Only the spreading in Antioch followed the proper pattern of preaching. Paul's work in chapters thirteen and fourteen are the proper pattern for gospel preaching throughout the ages. Acts 13 tells us of Paul's first missionary journey. This first journey was put in the Bible by the Lord as a pattern. Please remember that every time the Bible mentions something for the first time, the principle behind it remains as a guideline.</p><h2 class="head2">A Coordination of All Kinds of People</h2><p>Chapter thirteen mentions five persons. Lucius was a black man, Manaen was a nobleman, Barnabas was a good man, Simeon was an educated man, and Saul was one who had persecuted the church. They represented different kinds of people. This shows that the Lord chooses all kinds of "bad" people. (In this list Barnabas ranked first. This was according to Paul's own record. At this time Luke had not come into the work yet, and this portion of the history was probably related orally by Paul to Luke, who then wrote it down.)</p><h2 class="head2">Being Sent Out by the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Their going out was based on the Lord's calling. They fasted because they were afraid of making mistakes. In order to find the way to go on in the work, we often need to fast and pray. Verse 4 says, "They then, having been sent out by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia," and there they began their work. The words "went down" show that they set out for the work once they were clear about the sending of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Traveling Around and<br />Not Remaining in One Place</h2><p>They went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. In Cyprus they announced the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they passed through the whole island as far as Paphos. This is the apostles' pattern; they continued to travel and did not remain in one place. They passed through the whole island as far as Paphos. There the proconsul was saved. Then Paul set out again to Perga, and from there he went on to Pisidian Antioch. The record of many brothers today is a record of "being stationed" in a certain place, not a record of "moving"as shown in Acts. The record of Paul's preaching in chapter thirteen continued until verse 41. The result is seen in verse 42&mdash;they left the synagogue and the people begged for these words to be spoken to them on the next Sabbath. This verse proves that Paul had assumed a more prominent role than Barnabas had by this time. This is why the order of Barnabas and Paul is reversed in verse 43; Paul was mentioned first. When they were called by the Lord, the Bible says "Barnabas and Saul." But in the spreading of the work Paul was manifested to be better and was more able to speak for the Lord. Consequently, the Bible changes its record to "Paul and Barnabas." They immediately engaged themselves in the work of edifying the believers, urging them to continue in the grace of God.</p><p>At the next Sabbath, almost the entire city gathered together to hear the word of God. But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and they blasphemed. The apostles then turned to the Gentiles (vv. 44-46). When Paul preached to the Gentiles, many of them were saved. On the previous Sabbath the Jews were saved. On this Sabbath the Gentiles were saved. Verse 49 follows, saying, "And the word of the Lord was carried through the whole region." The words "whole region" are wonderful words. The last part of verse 51 through verse 52 says that they departed to Iconium, and the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. The reason many disciples are not filled with joy today is that their "pastors" have presided over one place for too long. We must remember that God does not want His workers to remain too long in one place. Wherever human control abounds, the Lord's hand stops. In many places today, saints cannot experience the filling of the Holy Spirit because the preachers are restricting the work of the Spirit. As long as Elijah remained on earth, there was no possibility for Elisha to receive the double portion of the Spirit. Elijah stood in the place of the Holy Spirit. Once Elijah left, Elisha received the double portion of the Spirit.</p>
