In the first half, God separated the dry land from the waters; in the second half, God caused the land to produce fruit. The first half of the work is a type of the fourth dispensation, the dispensation of promise. The second half of the work on the third day is a type of the fifth dispensation, the dispensation of law. God gave the law to the children of Israel for them to bear fruit. The law was like a plow to till the land deeply so that it could produce fruit. When God gave the law to the children of Israel, His original intention was for them to bear fruit. Water cannot bear fruit. Similarly God did not demand that the Gentiles bear fruit unto Him. God paid attention to the land. Through the law He sowed seeds in the nation of Israel. As a householder He often sent His servants to the husbandmen to ask for the fruits. We know that very little fruit was produced by the children of Israel. Nevertheless, God used them to produce fruits because "salvation is of the Jews" (John 4:22). The Lord Jesus was a man under law (Gal. 4:4). He kept the perfect law and produced the most excellent fruit. He was a real Israelite. As for the rest of the children of Israel, they will produce fruits in the millennial kingdom.</P><P>The work of the fourth day is the type of the sixth dispensation, the dispensation of grace. The heavenly luminaries clearly speak of Christ and His church. This represents the present church age. Christ is like the sun who appears in the heart of men through the power of the Holy Spirit. In this way men understand and receive His grace. During this period the church has a responsibility to reflect Christ's light. The present age is a long dark night. During this period Christ has ascended to the heavens. The church and saints are the only luminaries on the earth. We know that all the luminaries are from the heavens. For us to shine before men means that we should be seen as people of another world. Others will see that Christ is not of the world and that we also are not of the world. Our living should also bear the heavenly nature with Christ shining from our face through our joy and satisfaction in Him. The entire testimony of the church during this age of grace is related to this shining. What a pity that the light today has become so dim and unclear! The Bridegroom delays, and the light has become hazy. Apart from the lamps of the virgins, what other light is there in the world? The shining of the light of the gospel is the characteristic of the dispensation of grace.</P><P>The work on the fifth day is a type of the great tribulation period which starts at the end of the church age. There is a short period between the end of the sixth dispensation and the beginning of the seventh dispensation called the great tribulation. It is a time of testing for the inhabitants of the earth.</P><P>In the work on this day, God again worked in the waters. At that time billows and waves rose in the sea. This situation is described in Psalm 93:3-4. "The floods have lifted up, O Lord, / the floods have lifted up their voice; / the floods lift up their waves." This was the original condition on this day. But "the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, / yea, than the mighty waves of the sea" (Psa. 93:4).</P><P>This is the day of trial for the world because at this time God will cause trial to come on the whole inhabited earth (Rev. 3:10). The waters refer to the Gentiles. At this time the Gentiles will become loose in their own ways and rebel against the Lord. Therefore, they will be under trials from God. "Upon the earth anguish of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the billows, men fainting from fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth" (Luke 21:25b-26a). "When Your judgments are in the earth, / The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness" (Isa. 26:9). Therefore, the waters will be teeming with many living things. By this time God will have called all of his heavenly people home because God wants to prepare His earthly people on the earth. Although the duration of this period will not be long, God will do a preparation work, because He wants all the inhabitants on the earth to enjoy the blessings in the days when His righteousness and justice reign.</P><P>While the inhabitants on the earth are being tried, God will be working in the air. God not only created living creatures in the waters, He also made winged fowls in the air on this day. The spiritual meaning of this is not difficult to understand. The Bible tells us that when the inhabitants of the earth, the Gentiles, are under trials and being judged by God, the saints will be received by the Lord in the air. "Look at the birds of heaven. They do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father nourishes them. Are you not of more value than they?" (Matt. 6:26). "Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? And not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father...Therefore do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows" (Matt. 10:29, 31). Does this not refer to Christians? The winged fowls are actually animals in the heavens. Although they sometimes come to the earth, eventually they return home. The place where they abide and fly is in the air. God has ordained that winged fowls would fly above the earth in the air. At the time of the tribulation, "the Lord Himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord" (1 Thes. 4:16-17). The winged fowls will be returning home soon.</P><P>In the work on the sixth day, God created Adam and Eve and charged them to rule the earth. This is a type of the seventh dispensation, the dispensation of the kingdom. The apostle Paul tells us in Romans 5:14 that Adam was a type of Christ who was to come. He also tells us in Ephesians 5:25 and 32 that Eve is a type of the church, who will be offered to Christ without spot or wrinkle. During the seventh dispensation, Christ, as the Son of Man, will sit on His throne with His people (Rev. 1:13; 3:21). This kind of ruling involves God ruling through man. This man is the man Christ Jesus (1 Tim. 2:5).</P><P>In the work on this day, we see many living creatures produced on the earth. The living creatures in the waters and the winged fowls in the air have been mentioned. God will turn His attention to the children of Israel again. They are "the land." During the millennium, not only will Gentiles who have passed through the great tribulation become subjects of the kingdom, and not only will the saints reign with Christ, but also the children of Israel will become prosperous again. They will receive God's blessing which was prophesied through the prophets; they will receive what God promised when He made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. "In the days to come Jacob will take root; / Israel will blossom and bud; / And they will fill the face of the earth with their produce" (Isa. 27:6). At this time God will sow Jezreel in the land (Hosea 2:22b-23a).</P><P>The rest on the seventh day is a type of the new heavens and new earth, and of eternity after the millennium. Seven dispensations have passed. What remains is the rest. This rest is not a type of the millennium, because the millennium is not a rest. God rested on the seventh day and did not work anymore. But the millennium is still not the time for God to rest; not until the new heavens and new earth will God have rest. Therefore, the day of rest is not the type of the millennium.</P><P>There is not another day after the seventh day. All the work will have been completed. The heart's desire of God will have been accomplished. He blessed the day of rest. According to God's thought, there are only seven days. There is no need to continue another day after seven days. The work of redemption will have been accomplished. All things will have been accomplished according to God's eternal purpose. There will be no more need for time after the completed work. God will admire Himself in all the work He has done among the creatures and will bless them forever. Before the new heavens and new earth with the eternal rest come, however, God's work is not complete. His eyes delight to see His work of redemption being fully completed. Before it is fully complete, He cannot be satisfied. Truly, how can God have rest before such a consummation? He will rest when He sees His redeemed people completely joined to the unique, appointed One, receiving all authority and blessing. This is eternity. Eternity rests in God's satisfaction and praise. When will this time be?</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
