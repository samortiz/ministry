   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THERE BEING NO HIERARCHY IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, in the early church there was no hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet today in many Christian organizations there is a class called the clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is this according to the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You can serve God, and I also can serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all can serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is there any difference between your service and my service to God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may have different functions and points of emphasis, but essentially your service and mine should not be different.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we all intend to attain God's original goal, every one of us should serve God 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the early church, every believer was a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before they were saved, they lived for mammon, but from the day they were saved, they were separated from the world by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They still had their occupations, but their occupations were only for their livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their primary occupation was to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must be like the early believers if we intend to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our job should become our secondary occupation, merely for us to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We no longer live on the earth to make a living for ourselves but to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The early apostles and disciples all lived this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HIERARCHY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In A.D. 313, Constantine made Christianity the state religion and strongly promoted it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He encouraged the Romans to join the church and promised them rewards.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Basically, those who joined the church for rewards were not regenerated or saved and therefore could not serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They came into Christianity, but Christ did not come into them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They had not been saved by God to come out of the world; rather, they were still in union with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the number of such ones increased, some of them decided to bring the Judaic system and practice into Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Judaism, not everyone could serve God; only the priests could.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The professing Christians brought the Jewish priestly system into Christianity so that they could continue their worldly living without caring for the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All spiritual matters were entrusted to the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Catholic Church the priests were called "fathers."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The so-called Catholic fathers are equivalent to the priests in Judaism, and the long robes which they wear are the same as the robes of the Old Testament priests.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the time of the Reformation, the reforms carried out by Luther were very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In fact, the Protestant churches inherited many traditions from the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Catholic Church had priests; the Protestant churches had pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many of the Protestant churches were called state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, the Anglican Church, or the Church of England, was established as a state church with its pastors and bishops receiving salaries from the government.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even today, when the king or queen of England is crowned, the archbishop has to lay hands on him or her.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Episcopalian Church spread to China, it was still a state church and still had its clergy, which was copied from the priestly system of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later, in Protestantism there were the private churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some Christians saw the truth in the Bible concerning baptism that a person should be baptized after believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Others saw that the church should be administered by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Consequently, those who were in favor of baptism formed the Baptist church while those who approved of the administration of the church by the elders formed the Presbyterian church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later John Wesley was raised up by the Lord, and subsequently the Wesleyan church was formed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these so-called churches have a pastoral system.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Up to the present, in the Roman Catholic Church the priests still handle the sacred duties and serve God on behalf of the common people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Protestant state churches have their bishops while the private churches have their pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such a concept of a clergy-laity system seriously damages people and hinders them from serving God.</S>
