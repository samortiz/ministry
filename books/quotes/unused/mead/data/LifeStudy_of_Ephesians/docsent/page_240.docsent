   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 4:13 Paul says, Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to this verse, we need to arrive at three things: at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fullness of Christ, which is the Body, has a stature, for Paul speaks of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The stature of the fullness of Christ is equal to the stature of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter one reveals that the Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ, and chapter four, that the fullness of Christ has a stature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the stature of the fullness of Christ is the stature of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 4:13 Paul speaks not only of the stature of the fullness of Christ, but of the measure of that stature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the Body of Christ, the church has stature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because this stature grows, 4:13 speaks of its measure.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This measure is the full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In many believers the stature of the fullness of Christ has not grown very much.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, with them there is very little measure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But as Christ grows within them, they will gradually increase unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to press on until we all arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Presently we are on the way toward a full-grown man, toward the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The day is coming when we shall all arrive at a full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Until then, we are still in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because we are in the process, Paul speaks of the time when we shall be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the Body of Christ, the church is the fullness that is daily growing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is vital for us all to see that the church is an organism that comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anything that is not of Christ cannot be part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No matter how disciplined, regulated, or improved we may be, none of this is of the church if it does not issue out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Self-regulation, self-discipline, and self-improvement may produce an excellent society, but it cannot produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As far as the Body of Christ is concerned, nothing that we have in ourselves has any significance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In relation to the Body, natural goodness is of no advantage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether we are good or evil, we still need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who are evil surely need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But those who are very good need Christ just as much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No matter what kind of disposition we may have, our natural being needs to be swallowed up and even consumed by the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then in reality we shall be the Body of Christ, His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>RECEIVING OF HIS FULLNESS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 1:16 says, For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is important is not that we merely learn about Christ or that we imitate Christ, but that we receive of His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is so rich that He has an overflow called the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of this fullness we may all receive grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we daily receive of His fullness, we shall eventually become His fullness, for we shall be constituted according to what we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that the more we receive of His fullness, the more we shall be constituted of His fullness and become His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we see this, we shall say, Lord, save me from anything that is not Your fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lord, I am willing to pay any price to enjoy You and to partake of Your fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we may daily experience Him and enjoy Him and thereby become the church that is His very fullness, His overflow.</S>
