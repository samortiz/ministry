   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the firstborn Son of God being the Word of God John 1:1 is God's oracle for the speaking and dispensing of God to carry out His eternal economy, so the many sons of God being members of the Word of God are God's oracle speaking and dispensing God for the spreading of God and the increase of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, we, the believers as the sons of God to be the prophets of God, should speak God's word in season and out of season for the carrying out of God's eternal economy 2 Tim 4:2.</S>
