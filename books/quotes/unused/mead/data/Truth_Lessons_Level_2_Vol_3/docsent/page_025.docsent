   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Sanctifier</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To the believers Christ is also the Sanctifier.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hebrews 2:11 says, "For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both the firstborn Son and the many sons of God are born of the same Father God in resurrection Acts 13:33; 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, both the firstborn Son and the many sons are the same in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ, our Sanctifier, sanctifies us not only positionally but also dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He gives us not only a change in our position but also a change in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to be the Sanctifier who sanctifies us dispositionally, Christ had to pass through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification, and exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before His incarnation, Christ was the only begotten Son of God, having only the divine nature and not the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time He could not be our Sanctifier dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He was incarnated, He put on human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But His human nature was not the Son of God because His human nature had not been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, He needed to pass through death and resurrection in order for that human part to be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way He became the firstborn Son of God, having both the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now He can be the Sanctifier to us who have been regenerated as the many sons of God and who have both the divine nature and the human nature as He does; He can cause us to be sanctified in disposition as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, Hebrews 13:12 says, "Therefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is typified in the Old Testament by the blood of the sin offering being brought into the Holy of Holies on the day of propitiation to make propitiation for the people and the body of the sacrifice being burned up outside the camp Lev 16:14-16, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The blood of Christ, who is the real sin offering, was brought into the true Holy of Holies to accomplish redemption for us, and His body was sacrificed for us outside the gate of the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He suffered the death of the cross, shed His blood on it, and entered the Holy of Holies in heaven with His blood Heb 9:12 that by the heavenly ministry 8:2, 6 of His heavenly priesthood 7:26 He might be able to do the sanctifying work, and we might enter within the veil by His blood to participate in Him as the heavenly Sanctifier, the One who sanctifies us positionally and dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is not only our Sanctifier; He Himself is our sanctification 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whereas the crucified Christ is for our justification, the resurrected Christ is for our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the life-giving Spirit, He indwells us today as our life, and He is saturating us with His holy nature until we are thoroughly sanctified dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not only positional sanctification by the Lord's blood but also dispositional sanctification by the divine life, even by Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord who sanctifies us is now working within our spirit, spreading Himself from the center of our being throughout every part of us until He reaches the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then, we will be completely saturated with His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The accomplishing of this dispositional sanctification requires our lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we remain under the dispensing of the Triune God to experience Christ as our dispositional sanctification, we will daily be saturated with the divine nature until we are thoroughly transformed in mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ is not only our righteousness and sanctification but also our redemption, the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the Redeemer of our body, Christ will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The body of humiliation is our natural body, made of worthless dust Gen 2:7 and damaged by sin, weakness, sickness, and death Rom 6:6; 7:24; 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The body of glory is the resurrected body, saturated with God's glory and transcendent over corruption and death Rom 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The redemption of our body is its glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In resurrection Christ became the Spirit, and this Spirit, according to the principle of His regenerating us in our spirit, completely saturates our body of sin, which is of death and is mortal, with the glory of His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, He transfigures our body, making it the same as His resurrected, glorious body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the ultimate step of God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here He is expressed in full unto the ultimate manifestation in the New Jerusalem for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We then enjoy Christ as our portion.</S>
