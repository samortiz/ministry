First, we want to see the history of the church in a general way, and then we want to see the history of the local churches beginning from 1922 (editor's note: this history was given by the author in 1973).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S GOAL&#151;THE CHURCH</H2><P>God's goal is the church, and the church is a corporate matter. The book of Ephesians reveals the church in seven major aspects: the Body (1:22-23), the new man (2:15), the kingdom (2:19), the household (2:19), the dwelling place of God (2:21-22), the bride, the wife, of Christ (5:23-32), and the warrior (6:10-20). These aspects of the church are all corporate matters. Throughout the centuries of church history, the problems, the confusion, and the divisions took place due to the saints not seeing the corporate church of God. In the past the saints saw something concerning such items as God's salvation, sanctification, and the need of being spiritual, keeping the holy Word, not loving the world, and being for the Lord's interest and work on this earth. They also saw that we need to labor to win souls and that we need to be enthusiastic for evangelism to the extent that we would go to other lands for the spread of the gospel. However, all of these items are not God's goal but are the means to reach His goal. God has only one goal. God's goal is unique. God's ultimate goal is the church.</P><P>The church is not something merely for the future. Today is the dispensation, the age, of the church. The next age is the age of the kingdom of a thousand years. The church is for now; the church is for today. God's goal is to have a church today, a church in this dispensation, a church on this earth. Many dear saints throughout the centuries received light on many things in the Bible, but they missed the mark of God's divine economy and the goal of God's eternal purpose. The Lord desires to fulfill His purpose and to make His goal so clear to all His loving seekers.</P>
