   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NEED OF KNOWING THE POSITION OF WARFARE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to know the ascension, we need fourthly to know the position of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The position of spiritual warfare is absolutely in the heavenly places.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we lose the position of ascension, we are unable to carry on any spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the battlefield, all military strategists pay attention to the problem of position.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whoever takes the high ground against the low ground can win the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the spiritual battleground, this principle is even more important.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can say that spiritual warfare depends solely on the problem of position.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we wish to win in the fight, the position of ascension must be absolutely known and kept.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must see the fact that the spiritual warfare mentioned in the sixth chapter of Ephesians is based on the position of ascension in the second chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second chapter of Ephesians declares that we are sitting together with Christ in heavenly places.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the sixth chapter goes on to speak of our wrestling against spiritual hosts of wickedness in heavenly places v. 12 . This means that we must first be men of ascension with the position of ascension before we can attack the enemy in the air from above.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are men of earth and lose the position of ascension, we will fall into the hand of the enemy and cannot fight against him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the position of spiritual warfare is absolutely in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Genesis 3:14 tells us that after the serpent enticed Eve, God judged him by causing him to move about on his belly and to eat dust all the days of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moving on his belly limits the sphere of his activity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He can only creep on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eating dust limits the object of his devouring.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He can only eat things pertaining to the dust of the earth as food.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The serpent in Genesis 3 is the embodiment of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the judgment against the serpent is also the judgment against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, the sphere of Satan's activity is earth, and the object of his devouring is the man of earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Corinthians 15:47-48 tells us that Adam and all those belonging to him are earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, whenever we live in the earthly life of Adam, we are earthly and also on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We not only cannot fight against Satan, but we also fall into the sphere of his activity and become the object of his devouring.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Contrariwise, whenever we live in the heavenly life of Christ, we are heavenly and are in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus we transcend Satan's sphere of activity and are no longer the object of his devouring.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, we can attack him and overcome him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This principle of warfare is also very evident in our practical daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether in the church, at home, or at the place of our employment, whenever we have a touch of sin, a love for the world, a display of temper, a dealing in craftiness, or a living in the earthly life, we simply cannot be strong before the enemy and fight against him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At this time we are already earthly and have fallen into the hand of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, if we constantly have fellowship with the Lord, walk in spirit, and live in the heavenly life, we are heavenly and abide in the position of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we can stay on higher ground over against lower ground and deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At this time, should the church encounter difficulties, we can engage in prevailing prayer before God, demanding God to come forth to judge His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can rise to express our attitude to God, saying, "We will not allow these things to happen in the church."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can also say seriously to Satan, "We are disgusted with this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are against this."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we make such a severe declaration and strong expression, the entire host of Satan will retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His work will also be completely destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we live in the earthly life, using natural methods and means, we will never be able to solve these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have already fallen from heaven and lost the position of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have no way to deal with God's enemy and nullify his works.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why does the position of ascension cause us to be victorious in battle?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is because only in the position of ascension may we have heavenly authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to wage spiritual warfare, we need to depend upon heavenly authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is only one place where we can obtain heavenly authority: this place is heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we pass through death and resurrection to reach the heavenly realm, we will surely obtain heavenly authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore we will surely be victorious in battle.</S>
