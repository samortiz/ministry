   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man's Anger</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When he learned that God did not look upon his offering, "Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell" Gen 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is the same among religious people today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you fail to appreciate their works, they will be angry with you and say, "Are we not serving God?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why don't you agree with me?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When religious people see others serving God in His way and thus gaining His respect, they will be even more furious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Cain was the leader in this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you serve God, following the way of Abel, meaning that you follow God's way, the so-called religious people will be angry with you and say, "Don't you think that we also are serving God?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why should God accept you and not us?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have heard these words quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I ask you to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although you are serving God, in whose way are you serving Him in yours or in His?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you serve God according to His revelation or according to your concept and invention?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Simply to say that you are serving God is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must determine the way in which you are serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is your service according to God's Word or according to your own ideas?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God, however, was merciful toward Cain and still talked to him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Cain did not pray to God nor ask Him, "God, what is wrong with me?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although he did not pray, God, who is rich in mercy, came to him and spoke with him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Gen 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God was asking Cain why he was so angry and why his countenance had fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The people who follow God's way all have an uplifted countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They lift up their countenance and say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Amen, hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jesus is Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the King James Version, God said to Cain, "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Hebrew may also be rendered, "If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are in God's way, our countenance will be lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although many religious people serve God and worship Him, God does not look at them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They become angry as a result, saying, "Am I not serving God?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Am I not doing many things for Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such angry words are indicators of a fallen countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Cain was angry God seemed to say to him, "Cain, you don't need to be angry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Haven't you heard the glad tidings from your parents?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have My way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why have you become a person with a fallen countenance?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You are like this because you have forsaken My way, because you have not listened to the preaching of your parents, and because you have not believed the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you take My way and believe the gospel, your face will be lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Cain, it is still not too late.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you go on this way, sin is crouching at the door seeking to devour you."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Genesis 4:7 God gave Cain a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"And if thou doest not well, sin is crouching at the door" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The latter part of this verse is difficult to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The King James Version says, "And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Other versions render the pronouns "his" and "him" as "its" and "it," meaning that sin's desire is for you and that you must overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The King James Version is correct, using the pronouns "his" and "him."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Who is the "him" mentioned in this verse?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The answer is found in John 8:44 and 1 John 3:12.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>With the help of these verses we can realize that the "him" in Genesis 4:7 is the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, God was telling Cain that sin was crouching at the door and that his desire, meaning Satan's desire, was for him, and that Cain had to overcome him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sin and Satan are one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Be careful!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you reject God's way of salvation, sin is crouching at the door to get you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sin's desire, that is, Satan's desire, is for you, and you must overcome him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The best way to overcome Satan is to flee from your own concept and hide in God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's salvation is Jesus as the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Jesus shed His blood for our sins and has given Himself to us as righteousness to cover our nakedness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the way for us to flee from Satan and to escape the sin which is crouching at our door.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If any one of you reading this message will not take Jesus as your Savior, I must tell you that sin is crouching at your door like a ravenous beast, waiting for the opportunity to seize and devour you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This sin is Satan, the subtle one, the liar, the one who was a murderer from the beginning.</S>
