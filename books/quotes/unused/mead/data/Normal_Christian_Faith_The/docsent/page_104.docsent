   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INDIRECT INFLUENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You may jump at me immediately, saying, "Are we going to ignore society and betray our country?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are we going to overlook things while races are being oppressed, nations are being harassed, and classes are being exploited?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I can only give a simple answer to this: we can only be concerned for one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible shows us what this one thing is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The rest is not our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a man is saved, he will naturally be beneficial to society.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He will naturally be an asset to his community and nation, and he will naturally not be injurious to others or animals.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no question about this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have only one direct work, and that is to evangelize.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The result will automatically be carried over to the community and nation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, this result is only indirect fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are primarily concerned with the spiritual outcome; the physical one will definitely be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we take care of individuals, society at large will reap the benefits.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>SAVE OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our job is not to deal directly with the problems of our nation, reorganize our institutions, or revolutionize our political system.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not here to directly settle the problems among races.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot find these kinds of commandments in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What the Bible shows us is that we should do our best to save others and solve the individual problems of sin and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When sinners are saved, they will automatically affect their community, nation, and human institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But all this help is rendered indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not deal with them directly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>LIGHT AND SALT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus said, "You are the salt of the earth...You are the light of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some misinterpret these words and stand up to propose that we should make our world a brighter and cleaner place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we have to realize what light and salt are.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible only shows what light is in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ephesians 5:13 says, "Everything that makes manifest is light."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Light is that which exposes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a Christian, to be the light of the world means that you expose the people around you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, if everyone around you is an alcoholic and none has ever been uneasy about it before, your presence will convict them of their wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Or perhaps they are all gamblers and insensitive to their sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Your presence will make them feel ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everyone around you is quarrelsome and provocative.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But you only smile at them without participating in their activities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Your presence will convict them of their corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what it means to be a light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you expose their wrong in their midst, you are a light to them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are merely lights.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are not here to burn up the casinos, round up the outlaws, and reform society.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be a light means that formerly others did not know what is evil, but your presence as a Christian convicts them of their vices.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Light is what exposes everything.</S>
