 <h2 class="head1">BAPTIZING PEOPLE INTO THE TRIUNE GOD&mdash;<br />
INTO THE ORGANIC UNION WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>In order to baptize people into the Triune God, we must have the impact. We must baptize others with much assurance and confidence that we are not merely putting them into the water but that we are putting them into the Triune God. The water represents, signifies, symbolizes, the Triune God. According to Matthew 28:19, to baptize people into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit means to put them into the organic union with the Triune God (see notes 19<sup>4</sup> and 19<sup>5</sup> on this verse in the Recovery Version).</p>
<h2 class="head1">REQUIRING THE LORD TO GO AND ACT WITH YOU</h2>
<p>When you go out to visit people for the gospel, you must require the Lord to go and act with you (Matt. 28:20b; Mark 16:20). You must tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You have to go and act with me. If You do not give me the assurance that You are going with me and taking action with me, I will not go.&rdquo; You need to learn to pray yourself into this kind of assurance. Otherwise, you should not go. Even to have two or three gospel companions with you is not adequate. You must have the Lord Jesus. You must have the assurance that He is going with you. Then you will be able to tell people, &ldquo;I have come with Christ to visit you.&rdquo; When you say this to people, you will not speak it in a light way, but you will really mean business because you have the assurance that Christ is with you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT TAKING THIS KIND OF GOSPEL VISITATION<br />
AS AN EASY MATTER AND<br />
AVOIDING ANY KIND OF LIGHTNESS</h2>
<p>Finally, you must not take this kind of gospel visitation as an easy matter, and you must avoid any kind of lightness (1 Thes. 2:1-4, 7-12). You must be a person full of gravity who attracts not only people&rsquo;s attention but also their respect. Even if you are a young person speaking to an elderly professor, you must show him your gravity. Do not go out in an easy or light way. You must go out with Christ and with much gravity.</p>
<p>We should try our best to build up a habit of visiting people by knocking on their doors for gospel preaching. We need to practice it in a proper way according to the nine items presented in this chapter. Then we will be fully equipped and qualified to visit people for the gospel. I hope that such a habit will be built up in every church. If we will practice the principle of one-fourth of the saints in the church going out and the other three-fourths praying and supporting, I believe that it is possible for us to have an increase of one hundred percent every year.</p>
<p>While we are knocking on people&rsquo;s doors for the preaching of the gospel, we also have to endeavor to have proper meetings. Through the proper meetings, the new ones that we gain will be kept. If we bring them to the Lord and do not have the proper meetings to preserve and keep them, they will be lost. We need proper home meetings and group meetings to keep the new believers. Three things are basic and crucial: to visit people, to set up home meetings, and to have group meetings. Out of the visiting of people will come the home meetings, out of the home meetings will come the group meetings, and out of the group meetings will come the larger church meetings. By this way, we can build up the local church for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
