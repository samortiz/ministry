<h2 class=head1>THE BLOOD AROUND THE ALTAR</h2><p>The third point concerns the shedding of the blood. The offering was killed on the altar by the presenter, and then the priest sprinkled the blood around the altar. We all know that the altar symbolizes the cross, and the killing of the offering symbolizes the Lord’s death. But the blood of the peace offering was not to be brought into the Holiest of All; it was to be sprinkled around the altar where the peace offering was enjoyed. It was not for God, but for the presenter, for when the presenter looked at the blood, he immediately had peace.<p>We know that Satan, the accuser, is always busy. He never sleeps. Wherever we are, there he is, and he is even with us now. He is always accusing the hearts and minds of the saints. Sometimes he says, “What are you doing here in this meeting? Don’t you remember how you lost your temper this morning? Don’t you remember what you did today? You have no right to be here.” What shall we do when the accuser comes to us in such a way? Praise the Lord for the blood! We must not only apply the blood, but also point the enemy to the blood. We must say, “Satan, look at the blood! You ask me to look at my failures, but I ask you to look at the blood!” When we do this, there is real peace.<p>But sometimes we are not so bold. Immediately after Satan accuses us, we pray, “O Lord, have mercy upon me and forgive me.” Is this right or wrong? It is absolutely wrong! Do not pray or confess, but declare to Satan that the blood is here. “Satan, look at the blood! You ask me to look at my failures and my sinfulness, but I demand you to look at the blood!” This really gives us peace. We have the blood of Christ, and the blood gives us peace. Hallelujah! We do have an altar for the shedding of the blood, and we have the sprinkling of the blood around the altar. This is the peace offering.<p>How many times have you applied the blood in this way? I am afraid that many, many times we have applied the blood in a begging way, not in a way of declaration and proclamation. Moreover, it is not necessary for us to claim; we must simply proclaim: “Satan, look at the blood!” Would we be so bold? If we practice this, we will have peace.<h2 class=head1>TWO COLUMNS OF THE PEACE OFFERING</h2><p>The fourth point concerning the peace offering is that it is built upon the previous offerings. “And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.…If he present it for a thanksgiving, then he shall present with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, soaked. Besides the cakes, he shall present for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings” (Lev. 3:5; 7:12-13, lit.).<p>The peace offering is built upon two columns of the burnt offering and the meal offering. The two foregoing offerings are the base of the peace offering. We all must realize that though there are five kinds of offerings, yet only two are the base: the burnt offering and the meal offering. These two are the basic offerings upon which the following offerings are built. According to Leviticus 3:5, the peace offering must be burned upon the burnt offering. If we do not have the burnt offering, we have no place to burn the peace offering. The burnt offering is a base for burning the peace offering. Then Leviticus 7:12-13 shows us that the meal offering is also necessary for presenting the peace offering.<p>What does this mean? It simply means that we must first experience Christ as the burnt offering and then as the meal offering. Then upon these experiences we may have the experience of Christ as the peace offering. If we are going to offer Christ as the peace offering, we need many experiences of Christ as the meal offering. The more we experience Christ as the meal offering by enjoying His humanity, the more we will enjoy Him as the peace offering. Hence, the experience of the peace offering is based mainly upon the burnt offering and the meal offering.
