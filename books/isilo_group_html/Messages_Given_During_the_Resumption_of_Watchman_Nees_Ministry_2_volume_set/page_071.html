It is quite a demanding work, and we cannot consider it lightly. I can testify that before every gospel meeting, I have to speak to the brothers and sisters at least twice, to let every one enter the burden of the gospel before we actually preach to the outsiders. Today the gospel is preached by the church, and everyone has a part in it; everyone can give themselves to this work. Of course, this does not mean that everyone can deliver a message on the podium. Yet in the work of gospel preaching, the delivering of the message occupies only a small part of the various responsibilities. The other responsibilities rest with the brothers and sisters. This kind of gospel preaching will not put the burden on the shoulders of one person only.</P><P>There is a big difference between a gospel preaching that is done in coordination and one that is done individually. Every time, before I deliver a gospel message, all the brothers and sisters first do their part in inviting their friends and making all the preparations. I am like one who sits on a sedan chair; there is no need for me to do much. After the message, everything is handled by the brothers and sisters also. I can go home and rest. This kind of coordination does not put the burden on the shoulders of one person alone. Instead, it becomes the church preaching the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br>IN ONE ACCORD</H2><P>In Chefoo, during the New Year, none of the brothers and sisters would celebrate the festival. Everyone prepares only simple meals. Some brothers and sisters only cook once in the morning and eat leftovers for lunch and dinner. Some who come from distant localities bring their own food with them, while the church provides only water and tea for them. Other brothers and sisters would invite gospel friends to eat at their homes. The Chinese New Year festival is very much related to superstitious practices and idol worshipping. In addition, during the New Year season, all the illegal and sinful things are done in the open. In this demonic festival, theatrical groups would be set up in front of the idol temples and would sing to the idols. In spite of all these activities, every time we preach the gospel, we gain many people.</P><P>In preaching the gospel, as long as we are one, we will see many people saved. In Tsingtao, our number was originally quite small, about one hundred thirty brothers and sisters. After I worked there for two months, from April 15 to June 15, we had an increase of two hundred people. Originally we did not have a baptistry. Later a baptistry was built in a brother's home, and the church began baptizing people every month.</P><P>Here in Swatow, you have about three hundred brothers and sisters. If you are in one accord, by the end of this year you should have one thousand saints. But if you argue with one another and divide yourselves into five or six groups, the number will surely decrease.</P><P>I have a burden in my heart, which is that the church here should preach the gospel in one accord. In the matter of gospel preaching, I hope that the church would learn to mobilize everyone. The main emphasis is not merely the saving of the sinners, but the oneness among the saints. If you do this, the number of saved ones will increase all the time.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 71</div><br></body></html>
