   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE EIGHTY BEING TRANSFORMED 3 5 The Experience at Bethel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that many crucial seeds of the truth are sown in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The house of God, Bethel, is one of these seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, not many Christians know what the experience of the house of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Undoubtedly, many know that, according to the New Testament, the house of God denotes the church 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But where is the practical and proper church life?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although there are millions of Christians on earth, very few of them have the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many merely sit in the congregation for the Sunday morning service and listen to a minister or pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this is not the practical and proper church life revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the Bible, in the genuine church life every saved one must be a living, functioning member.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every member of the Body of Christ must function.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only do the members function, but they also live together to express God in Christ in a living, daily way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the practical church life revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The truths regarding this practical church life are sown as seeds in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Prior to chapter thirty-five, God was called the God of a certain person, for example, the God of Abraham or the God of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was the God of individual persons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in 35:7 we have "El-Beth-el," the God of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is no longer simply the God of individuals; He is now the God of a corporate body, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians only experience God as their individual God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not many have the experience of God as the God of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How much experience do you have of God as the God of a corporate body?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all must experience God in such a way that He is not only God to us individually, but also the God of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a great difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Genesis 35 we see a crucial and radical turn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, not many children of God appreciate this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They read this chapter again and again without recognizing the radical turn contained in it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before this chapter, God was the God of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was the God of Abel, the God of Enosh, the God of Enoch, the God of Noah, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But here He is no longer just the God of individuals, but El-Bethel, the God of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Hebrew, "El" means God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the title El-Bethel this Hebrew word for God is used twice, at both the beginning and the ending of this title.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a sense, the God of the house of God is double.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must admit that we do not yet have much experience of this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we thank the Lord that after coming into the church life, we have had some experience of God's being God to us as a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the church life, we do experience God corporately and not only individually.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all can testify that the God we experience in the church life is much richer and sweeter than the God we experience in our individual life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why we like to spend more time in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Individually, we can experience the God of Abraham or the God of Isaac, but we cannot experience God as the God of Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can only experience the God of the house of God in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If many years ago you had been told about the God of the corporate body, it would have sounded like a foreign language to you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But today this is not foreign to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are familiar with this experience and we appreciate it much more than our individual experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This does not mean, however, that there is not the aspect of experiencing God in an individual way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even today, there is still this aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Never forget that the truths in the Bible have two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is also true of the experience of God, for the experience of God has a corporate aspect as well as an individual aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many Christians today either have no experience of God or have just the individual experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They lack the experience of God in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But in meeting after meeting of the church life, we experience God in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At this point, I need to speak an honest word to some of you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although you meet with us week after week, you do not have the corporate experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For instance, you pray daily in your private life, but you never pray in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the meetings, you are observers, like a spectator at a ball game.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You watch others play, but you yourselves do not play.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You never participate in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Furthermore, some of you criticize those who do participate, saying that they are too bold or too quick.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But what about you?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are you here to be critics, spectators, or to participate in the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This indicates that some among us do not appreciate the experience of God in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some of us still do not pray in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you were asked to pray, you would always excuse yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This reveals that you consider others as the priests and yourselves as the common people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By doing this you establish a clergy-laity hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the eyes of God, this is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all must pray to overthrow this clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to my registration, the prayer meeting in Anaheim is better than that in any other church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I have visited nearly all the churches and I can testify that the prayer meeting in Anaheim is the best.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The reason is that there is no clergy or laity in our prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although many pray, no one completes a prayer by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rather, it may take many of us to finish one prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the old, traditional way, when someone prayed, he not only finished one prayer but perhaps two or three other prayers at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Either people did not pray at all, or they would pray several prayers in succession.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But in Anaheim after someone prays a short sentence, someone else will follow him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In this way, many function together to offer one prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the experience of El-Bethel, the corporate experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Genesis 35 is a radical turn from the individual experience of God to the corporate experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Before this chapter, El-Bethel is not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Elohim was revealed in chapter one, and Jehovah was revealed in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Later, God told Jacob that He was the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But, as we have pointed out, in chapter thirty-five we see a new divine title El-Bethel, God of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Elsewhere in this message we shall see the significance of God's telling Jacob that his name was no longer Jacob but Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God said to Jacob, "Israel shall be thy name" v. 10 , and Jacob seemed to say to God, "Your name is El-Bethel." Who are you today Jacob or Israel? What does Israel mean? To answer that it means a wrestler of God is too doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Israel is the church people, and El-Bethel is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We are the church people in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is not doctrine; it is experience.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The church people are a people filled with God, and the church life is a corporate life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The church people are a people filled with God living together to enjoy God and to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is Israel in El-Bethel.</S>
