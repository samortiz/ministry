   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Forty-eight THERE IS NO PEACE TO THE WICKED Scripture: Isa 57:20-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we preach the gospel, we have to be careful in choosing words and topics.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Try not to close people s hearts the moment you open your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everything in the universe has a law Use enough examples to let people see that everything in the universe has a law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not only do the stars have their laws, but in the existence of all living creatures there are laws.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Try not to give too many examples, but use just enough to prove that everything in the universe has a law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If any kind of living thing that exists in the universe follows its own law, then it will be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If it goes against the law, then it will have no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What we have said so far is to lay the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The law of human life The law of human life is based upon the relationship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No doubt when we preach the gospel we must rely upon the Holy Spirit, but we also have to catch people s thought.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because there are many in the meeting with well-trained minds, the thoughts of the one who preaches should not be lacking in refinement.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is very orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore the human life planned by God is also very orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Expound this point.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The order which God has set up for man s life is good, bright, righteous, kind, and upright.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These five points should be explained in detail, from both the positive and the negative sides.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, the opposite of good is evil, and everything which is not orderly is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The abnormality of human life The order which God has set up for man s life is almost entirely contradicted by man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God ordered that man s life should be good, bright, righteous, kind, and upright.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in reality man is evil, dark, jealous, hateful, unrighteous, and crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Describe the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because man s life is so abnormal and contrary to the order set up by God, his life is full of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The evil of man s life is his rebellion against God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Take for example: stealing, not loving his wife, having envy against his classmates, disrespect toward his parents, not loving his colleagues, not helping a person who is suffering, and having no sympathy toward a poor beggar.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All of these are against God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we preach, we must touch people s feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you want to hit someone, you should hit him hard.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hit him all over until he is very sensitive; then he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The evil in human life causes life to be out of balance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the human life becomes a life without peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since it is out of balance, the human life is restless.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Life s restlessness The restlessness of life is manifested in man s conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When man goes against the good laws of God, there is the restless feeling of condemnation in his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a man steals, his conscience jumps up and down.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you have done something wrong or have lied, you would tremble, if someone should point at you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why a lie detector can test the inner situation of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Chinese have a saying in the same principle, discern a person according to his expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The restlessness of a person s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you spend money which you earned by your own labor and hard work, you feel an inner calm and a sweet sense within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if you spend money which has been stolen from others, you will feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another example: if you use your money to support and honor your parents, your heart feels peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if you keep the money for your own luxury or to spend on other women behind your wife s back, then your heart will be uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The whole reason men feel uneasy and have a sense of fear is that they have contradicted God s laws.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The restlessness in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After a short time, anything stolen may be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even if they are not exposed, a few days later you may have a car accident, or you may meet a pickpocket, or you may hit someone riding a bicycle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For three months you have tried your best to embezzle in your office or business to get two thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then you fell down and had to stay in the hospital, and the hospital bill was three thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These are examples of the restlessness in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These three points of restlessness are all caused by man s disobedience of God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The restlessness is God s reprimand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is like a train.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If it is derailed, something is out of order.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God s laws are like the rails.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the conscience is restless that is your warning telling you to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God s laws are meant to bring you to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you do not obey, in the future you will fall into the lake of everlasting fire.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You will have no peace forever.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore God said, There is no peace to the wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The life of the wicked is like the tossing sea.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Its waters toss up mire and dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Use some examples to describe how peaceful it is whenever anyone honors his parents or gets along well with his neighbors, and how restless it is otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Explain from both the negative and the positive sides.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The way of peace for man s life Explain that in our life, the source of peace is God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Just as God is the source of good and light, He is also the source of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When a man has God, he has peace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If he does not have God, he has no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, if you want to have peace, you must turn back to God and receive God, because God is the way to have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Repent and forsake evil.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Evil makes a man restless.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But God gives men peace.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, to obtain peace we must forsake evil and turn back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord Jesus shed His blood on the cross to solve the problem of man s sin before God, to accomplish eternal peace, and to reconcile men to God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The salvation and redemption of the Lord Jesus will give men peace.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For this reason you must receive this Savior as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many people have accepted the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They not only have the peace within, but also have a peaceful environment without.</S>
