If the inward aspect of the Spirit is more important than the outward aspect of the Spirit, why do we need the outpouring of the Spirit? Those who live a life of holiness and who know the Spirit as a person will have the strength to share this holiness with others once they receive the outpouring of the Spirit. Many people realize that they have many treasures hidden within, but they cannot open these treasures to others. Although others may admire or look up to them, they cannot get any help from them. They lack the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Let us now consider the practical benefits in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Power of Fellowship</h2><p>The first thing we obtain after we experience the outpouring is the power of fellowship. It enables us to convey the things in us to others. A man may have received something from God and may have accumulated something within yet not have the power to share it with others. Once they receive the outpouring of the Spirit, they will be able to share with others what is inside them. They will have the outward power to convey these inward things to others. Those who have the Spirit within are like a power plant. The plant may be full of light, but the whole city may be in darkness. There must be power lines to join the power plant to the city in order for the power to be conveyed to the whole city. If there is no power in the plant, nothing will happen. However, if there is power but no power lines, nothing will happen either. The power-conveying lines are a picture of the function of the outpouring. Many people have power lines, yet they have to light candles at night. They do not have anything inside them, yet they try to convey something to others. This will not work. We must have both the outward and the inward aspects of the Spirit. If we have passed the gate of victory, we will have something within us. Then we can proceed to seek the outpouring so that we can be empowered to share what we have with others.</p><h2 class="head2">Boldness</h2><p>Some have an excellent inward disposition, but they are very timid. They have to make up their mind a few times before they can stand up to speak or testify for the Lord. Some have believed in the Lord, but they are afraid of passing out gospel tracts to others. There are still some here today who have not yet received the outpouring of the Spirit. I will not ask if you want the outpouring, and I will not ask if you are afraid of the outpouring. I will only ask if you can be like those who have received the outpouring. You may have something real within, yet you are afraid to share it. Others may not have anything, but they are not afraid. What you lack is their boldness. I do not encourage those who have received the outpouring to act loosely, but those who have received the outpouring for the first time must be strong to testify because they have received the boldness. The brothers and sisters who have received the outpouring can be divided into two categories. The first are those who are still afraid and shy. The second are those who are not afraid and are bold. Before I received the outpouring of the Spirit, I would follow a gospel friend for a mile or two and still not muster enough boldness to open up my mouth to testify to him. I had the courage to read the Bible or pray in a train, but it would take some effort to pass out gospel tracts in the same train. After I received the outpouring of the Spirit, I was no longer afraid of anything. I was not even concerned with how I dressed. I became bold. I was not just "thick-skinned"; I "lost my skin" altogether.</p><h2 class="head2">No Self-consciousness</h2><p>Self-consciousness is the worst thing that a Christian can have. A self-conscious person pays attention to how well he dresses and how others respond to his words, etc. When he is invited to a meal, he cannot speak to others about the gospel in a released way. He cannot speak to a stranger without preparing himself carefully before he speaks. This is because he is always conscious of himself. He may be able to pray by himself in his room, but when he is in a public place, he cannot pray in the same way. In public he changes his tone, words, and expressions and becomes fearful of others' frowning. All of these reactions mean that there is too much self-consciousness. Such ones have a spirit, but their spirit is covered up by their soul, and they cannot be free. Once there was a meeting in a brother's living room. The Spirit came down, and everyone who was present was released. This kind of freedom is not licentiousness but a liberation in the spirit. Sometimes we are too restrained in the meetings. When there is too much restraint, no one will dare to speak. Mr. Evan Roberts saved many souls throughout his life. Many people have testified that he was the only one on earth that they met who did not have any self-consciousness. When he wanted to laugh he just laughed. When he wanted to look at someone, he just looked at him. Only those who are free from self-consciousness can work for God, and the only way we can be delivered from our self-consciousness is through the outpouring of the Spirit. Only those who have received the outpouring are free from self-consciousness.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 55</div><br></body></html>
