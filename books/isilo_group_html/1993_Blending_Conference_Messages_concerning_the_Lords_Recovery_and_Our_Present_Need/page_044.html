In John's Gospel there is the Son for life. In Acts 2 the Son in ascension was made both Lord and Christ (v. 36). This is for authority. Then in Ephesians 1 this one Christ is given to be the Head over all things to the church, which is His Body (vv. 22-23). With this one Lord there is the one faith, the common faith shared by all Christians concerning Christ's person and work (Titus 1:4; 2 Pet. 1:1; Jude 3). When we receive this faith, we believe into the one Lord. We believe into Him not only for life but also for authority that we may be headed up. After believing into the Lord, we are baptized into Him and into His death (Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27). This terminates our connection with Adam. Hence, by faith and baptism we are transferred out of Adam and into Christ, thereby being joined to the Lord and becoming one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). This makes us all one in Him.</P><P>In verse 6 there is the one God and Father, the One who purposed in eternity. He is the Originator, the source, of the constitution of the oneness of the Body. This constitution with the Divine Trinity causes the Body to have three functions. First, the Body is the expansion of the oneness of the Triune God; second, the Body is the vessel to contain the reality of the constituted oneness; and, third, the Body is the expression of the oneness. In His death on the cross Christ was working to create in Himself one new man, which is the one Body (Eph. 2:14-16), and in Christ's resurrection the Father operated to make us all alive in the one regeneration (1 Pet. 1:3). Then, in the outpouring of the Spirit we were all baptized into the one Body (1 Cor. 12:13). By this threefold operation of the Divine Trinity He fully opened Himself up and brought all of us into Himself so that we could be in Him, that is, in His oneness. Thus, we as the Body are the expansion of the oneness of the Divine Trinity. We are also the vessel to contain the oneness. The Body is the place where the believers and the Triune God participate together in the oneness. The Body is also the expression of the genuine oneness. The oneness is divine, spiritual, and therefore mysterious. It is altogether invisible to the natural man. Yet in John 17 the Lord prayed that by our oneness the world would believe and know that the Father sent the Son (vv. 21, 23). This means that the Body is the expression of the oneness to the world.</P><P>It is a wonderful fact that we have the oneness of the Spirit. Yet practically the apostle urged us to be diligent to keep it. This keeping of the oneness of the Spirit is the foremost aspect of our Christian walk. In Ephesians 4:1 the apostle besought us to walk in a manner worthy of God's calling. All serious Christians are concerned about their Christian walk, yet not many realize that the centrality of the Christian walk is to keep the oneness of the Spirit. According to verse 2, we should keep this oneness with all lowliness and meekness. These two virtues are Christ Himself. In Matthew 11:29 the Lord Jesus said, "I am meek and lowly in heart." Through the process of transformation this very Christ who is meek and lowly is infused into our soul. Thus He becomes our meekness and our lowliness. When we have Him as these two virtues, we also are long-suffering. He becomes our ability to suffer long. When we have Him as the three virtues of lowliness, meekness, and long-suffering, the condition of our heart is proper. Then the love that God has already poured out in our heart (Rom. 5:5) is released to all the believers. No matter who they are and no matter what their condition is, the divine love will be released through our heart to bear them in love. This is the keeping of the oneness by the experience of Christ in transformation.</P><P>Not only so, we keep the oneness in the uniting bond of peace. This is the peace that Christ created on the cross (Eph. 2:15). On the cross He crucified the old man and abolished the ordinances brought in because of the fallen condition of the old man. These two, the old man and the ordinances, are the source of all the separating ways of living. They are the source of all the dividing opinions and different loves and thoughts. But they have been crucified, and thus we can keep the oneness of the Spirit by the experience of the cross. In this way we have the peace. The oneness of the Spirit is kept by us in transformation and in the experience of the cross. This oneness of the Spirit is the Divine Trinity processed and mingled with the resurrected humanity. This is the one Body constituted with the Father as the source, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>1993 Blending Conference Messages concerning the Lord's Recovery and Our Present Need &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
