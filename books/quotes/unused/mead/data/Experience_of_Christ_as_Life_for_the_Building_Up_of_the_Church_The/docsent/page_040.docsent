   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEALING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to go on from being anointed to being sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit is also the sealing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The sealing forms the divine elements into an impression to express God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am encouraged when I see that God is being formed within many of you Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When people contact you, they will have the sense that with you there is the image of God and something of God formed within you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I can illustrate this by the following story.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once in Shanghai a certain sister came to visit us, and none of us had ever seen her.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we went to the pier to meet her, we were wondering how we would recognize her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we were watching the persons in the boat, we realized who the sister was.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There was a certain kind of image or impression with her, testifying that she must be a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has not only anointed us but also sealed us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has not only imparted His elements into us but has also impressed us with His own image with the form of the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the deeper experience of the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not the outward manifestation of the Spirit but the inward impression and sealing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE PLEDGING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 2 Corinthians 1:22 Paul said that God has "given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The pledge is the foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit is a foretaste, a guarantee, a sample, of the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is sweet to our spiritual taste.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God gives His Spirit to us as a foretaste of what we will inherit of God, affording us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the sisters cook something in the kitchen, they take a foretaste of it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when they bring it to the table, they take the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we are in the kitchen, not at the table.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We taste the Spirit as a foretaste, and this is a sample of the full taste of the Spirit to come on a greater scale.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to enjoy the indwelling Spirit as the foretaste day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is what we need for the growth in life, for the building up of the Body, and for the real practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more we experience the Spirit in such a hidden, deep, high, rich, and inner way, the more we will be delivered from being divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the more we experience the gifts in an outward way and the more doctrinal teachings we receive, the more puffed up and divisive we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why division and strife are so prevalent in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Corinthians had knowledge and the gifts, but they were fleshly and divisive, full of strife and envy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A brother who walks under the anointing, who is sealed by the Lord, and who enjoys the foretaste of the Spirit day by day has no possibility of being divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The way to build up the Body is not in 1 Corinthians but in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The building up of the Body is by the anointing, sealing, and pledging of the Spirit within us.</S>
