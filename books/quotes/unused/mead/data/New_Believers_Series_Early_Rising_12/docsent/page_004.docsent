   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Pray</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the early morning we should fellowship, praise, and gather the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must also pray to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalms 63:1 KJV and 78:34 KJV both say that we should seek the Lord early.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The prayer spoken of in the previous paragraph is a kind of blending prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the prayer we are talking about here is more specific.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After one fellowships, praises, and eats manna, he has strength and can present everything in prayer before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Prayer surely requires much strength.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One must first draw near to God early in the morning and be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then he can set aside about half an hour or a quarter of an hour to pray for a few urgent things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He can pray for himself, for the church, or for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, he can pray also in the afternoon or at night.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if he takes advantage of the fresh power he has gained, the power acquired in the early morning through fellowshipping with God and eating manna, he will receive greater support.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every believer should do these four things conscientiously before the Lord early in the morning: fellowship with Him, praise Him, read the Bible, and pray to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether or not a person has done these four things in the morning is manifested in his walk during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>George M ller confessed that the degree to which he was fed by the Lord in the morning determined his spiritual condition throughout the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His spiritual condition for the day depended on his feeding before the Lord in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many Christians find themselves weak during the day because their mornings are ill spent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, there are those who are so far ahead in their spiritual journey that they can experience the total separation of the spirit from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their outward man is broken, and they are not that easily shaken by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, this is another matter altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>New believers should learn to rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once they become loose in this, they become loose in everything, and everything will go wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is a great difference between being nourished and not being nourished in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A very famous musician once said, "If I skip practicing for one day, I will notice it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I skip practicing for two days, my friends will notice it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I skip practicing for three days, my audience will notice it."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If this is true for practicing music, it is even more true for the spiritual lesson of rising up early.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we fail to have a good morning watch before God, we will know it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who are experienced in the Lord also will know it when they come into contact with us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They will know that we have not touched the spiritual source.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From the very first day, new believers should strictly discipline themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every morning they should rise up early to exercise this way before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE PRACTICE OF EARLY RISING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Finally, we should speak a little about actual ways to implement this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can we rise up early?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to pay attention to a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All early risers must have the habit of going to bed early.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No one can stay up late and rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is like burning a candle at both ends.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not set too high a standard for rising.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people want to rise up at three or four o'clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they find out that they cannot make it, they quit after a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is better to take a moderate course.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Five or six o'clock is a suitable time to get up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Get up when the sun is about to rise or has just risen.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Always get up around sunrise.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If one tries to get up too early, his practice may not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>An unreasonably high standard will only result in a condemned conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some people have set too high a standard for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They get into problems with their family or their work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When they take hospitality at the homes of others, they get into problems with their hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not a profitable thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our standard should be reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We do not advocate extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not set too high a standard for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Before the Lord you should consider carefully the proper time for you to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You should take into consideration your physical limitations as well as the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Set your standard accordingly and keep it.</S>
