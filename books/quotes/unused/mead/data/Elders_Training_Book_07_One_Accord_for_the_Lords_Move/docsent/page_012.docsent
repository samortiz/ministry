   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE IN PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are two portions in 1 Corinthians concerning head covering and concerning women s ministry which show us that we need to be one in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There were many different thoughts concerning the matter of head covering, but Paul told the saints in 11:16 not to be contentious concerning this: But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The custom here is the custom of contention, disputation, and debating.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Neither the apostles nor the churches tolerated any disputation concerning the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The plurality of the churches here indicates that all the local churches are independent of one another, yet they all act in the same way according to the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The practice of all the churches should be uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Corinthians 14:33b-34 says, As in all the churches of the saints, let the women be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but let them be subject, as the law also says.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that all the local churches should be the same in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This prohibition of the sisters speaking in the church means that women are not permitted to teach with authority concerning the defining of doctrine cf.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1 Cor 11:5; Acts 2:17-18; 21:9; 1 Tim 2:12; see note 34 2 in 1 Corinthians 14 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The two practices concerning head covering and concerning women s ministry confirm that all the churches should be one in the same kind of unique practice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ONE IN THINKING AND SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 15:6 tells us that we should be with one accord and with one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word accord includes the mind, will, and purpose in the soul and the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to have one mind and one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that we only have one Head because only the head has a mouth and a mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all take the Lord Jesus as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only He is fully qualified to have the mind and to have the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not have the right because we are members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not have the mouth or the mind so we have to think with the mind of Christ Phil 2:2, 5; 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we have to speak with the mouth of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The mouth only has one head.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we considered this matter, we would not speak so loosely or freely; we would not speak whatever we like.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may like to speak something which the Head does not like.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are not the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the whole universe there is only one new man, and the one new man only has one Head with one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The mouth is not on the Body but with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must learn not to speak things so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Your speaking interferes with or profanes the mouth of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You do not have any mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What the church has as the mouth is the mouth of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What does it mean that we all have one mind and one mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means no longer I...but Christ lives in me Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is no more I, but Christ the Head that lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has a mouth, He has a mind, and I take Him as my person, so I would never use my mouth any longer to speak anything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who could believe that so many millions of Christians with different languages could have one mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible tells us this and we need to practice the one mouth to be one in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>ONE IN ESSENCE, APPEARANCE,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>AND EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The sign of the lampstands in Revelation 1:11-12 shows us that the churches need to be one in essence, appearance, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the lampstand we can see the Father as the gold substance with the essence, the Son as the embodiment with a definite form, shape, and style, and the seven Spirits as the seven lamps expressing the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The lampstand is a very complete consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every local church must be such an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The very essence of the substance of every church should be God the Father, and the form, the appearance, the shape, the style of every church must be the very embodiment of the Triune God, which is our dear Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not have any other kind of appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are we a group of people merely teaching others the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Are we a group of people in evangelical activity?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Are we a group of people teaching tongue-speaking and other gifts?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are we people who bear the testimony of the healing power?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is the appearance of your local church?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It has to be the appearance of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every local church should be in the unique appearance, in the unique form, shape, and style of that unique One who is not only the Son of God, but also the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Son of God was His essence on this earth, and the Son of Man was His appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>While He was walking on this earth, His very essence within was the Son of God and His appearance outwardly was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When He was walking among the lampstands, He was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John said that he saw One like the Son of Man 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must bear such an appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must have such a shape, such a style, such a form, that is the real appearance, the form, of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A local church should not have the appearance of Bible teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This might be a very good appearance, but it should not be the appearance of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The local church s appearance should be uniquely the form, the style, and the shape of the Lord Jesus, the unique Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then our expression must be the shining of the sevenfold, intensified Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is our expression, which is the very testimony of Jesus Christ.</S>
