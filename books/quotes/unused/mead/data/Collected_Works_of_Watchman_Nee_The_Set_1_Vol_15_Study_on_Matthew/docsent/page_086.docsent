   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The second question of the disciples concerns the coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning His coming there are three Greek words that we need to differentiate: 1 parousia, 2 epiphaneia, and 3 apokalupsis.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The disciples asked the Lord about the sign of His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word "coming" here is the Greek word parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This word should be translated "presence."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Coming is not exactly the right sense.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Parousia is used in the Bible twenty-four times.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Except for the five or six times when it refers to the coming of certain men, in the other ten or more times it refers to the appearing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The incidences where it refers to men are as follows: Philippians 2:12; 1 Corinthians 5:3; 2 Corinthians 7:6; and 1 Corinthians 16:17.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The incidences where it refers to Christ are as follows: 1 Corinthians 15:23; 1 Thessalonians 2:19; 3:13; 4:15; 2 Peter 1:16; 3:4; 1 John 2:28; Matthew 24:3, 27, 37, 39.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word epiphaneia appearing occurs in the following places: 1 Timothy 6:14; 2 Timothy 1:10; 4:1, 8; Titus 2:13; 2 Thessalonians 2:8.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It means to make visible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word apokalupsis unveiling, revelation occurs in the following places: 1 Peter 1:7, 13; 4:13; 1 Corinthians 1:7; 2 Thessalonians 1:7.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It means to make people understand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Matthew 24:3 the word "coming" is parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why does the Spirit use this word?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is because the things concerning the second coming are very complicated, and parousia has a very broad meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord's parousia will begin at the first rapture, which is to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>James 5:7 says, "Therefore be long-suffering, brothers, until the coming parousia of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>James 5:8 says, "You also be long-suffering; establish your hearts because the coming parousia of the Lord has drawn near."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All those who have long-suffering will be in the first rapture Rev 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>See again 2 Peter 3:4: "Where is the promise of His coming parousia ."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Read 1 Thessalonians 2:19: "Our Lord Jesus at His coming parousia ."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Will you be able to stand before His parousia?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Thessalonians 3:13 says, "At the coming parousia of our Lord Jesus with all His saints."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Thessalonians 4:15 says, "Unto the coming parousia of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the period when the Lord comes to the air is also included in the parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Thessalonians 5:23 says, "At the coming parousia of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What will happen during the parousia?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Corinthians 15:23 says that all those who are Christ's will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second Thessalonians 2:1 says that the Lord's parousia is the gathering of the believers to His gathering place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second Thessalonians 2:8 says that the Lord's parousia is versus the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second Thessalonians 2:9 speaks of the parousia of the "lawless one."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First John 2:28 says, "Not be put to shame from Him at His coming parousia ."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From the above verses, we can conclude that the parousia includes the throne and the air.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As far as time is concerned, it spans the period from the first rapture to the coming of Christ with His saints to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, the parousia is actually between the church and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It includes the first rapture to the throne, the Lord's coming to the air during the tribulation, the great tribulation, the second rapture of the believers, and Christ and the saints descending to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the parousia there are three periods, which occur in three places: 1 The beginning of the parousia commences with the overcoming believers' being raptured to the throne Matt 24:37-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2a After awhile the Lord will come to the air from the heavens please remember that the throne is in the heavens, Rev 4:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2b Meanwhile, the believers "who are living, who are left remaining" are raptured to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By then, the believers will meet the Lord in the air 1 Thes 4:16; 1 Cor 15:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>3 At the end of the parousia, the Lord with His saints will come from the air to the earth and will destroy Antichrist with the brightness of the manifestation of His coming 2 Thes 2:8-9 see diagram .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What should the attitude of the saints be toward the parousia?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Please read James 5:7-9: "Be long-suffering...awaits."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Thessalonians 3:13: "Establish your hearts blameless in holiness."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First Thessalonians 5:23: "May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What will believers do in the parousia?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They will be judged according to their works 1 Thes 2:19; 1 John 2:28; 1 Cor 3:12, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can see a type of the parousia from the appearing of the Lord's glory on the mount of transfiguration, as recorded in 2 Peter 1:16 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The parousia is the center of the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To understand the second coming, we must understand the parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Two other words are also related to the parousia: 1 apokalupsis, which means the Lord's revelation of Himself, and His removing of the covering veil; 2 epiphaneia, which is a raising of the curtain, through which one sees the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many think that the Lord's appearing must wait until the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a wrong understanding because apokalupsis and epiphaneia are also for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It does not say that the Lord will appear only to the world, but that He will appear to the church also.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the parousia, both apokalupsis and epiphaneia are included.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since we are with the Lord, He must apokalupsis, reveal Himself, to us, and we shall see His ephipaneia.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, we are waiting for the Lord's parousia, to be with Him, and we are also waiting for the Lord's apokalupsis and epiphaneia, to know Him and see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are not waiting for the Lord's coming to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although we are with the Lord today, this is spiritual and is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We still hope to see Him face to face on that day.</S>
