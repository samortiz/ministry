   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON NINETEEN SERVING THE LORD THE STATUS FOR SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once we are saved, our status is completely changed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After our salvation there are many aspects to our status.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, we are children of God in His household and citizens in His kingdom Eph 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are also priests of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation 1:5-6 and 5:9-10 say that God saved us in order to make us not only His people but also His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The basis for our service after we are saved is our status as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Priests are a group of professionals, just as teachers, lawyers, doctors, and engineers specialize in a profession.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Teachers specialize in teaching, doctors in healing the sick, lawyers in handling legal affairs, and engineers in construction work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Priests specialize in serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Serving God is the profession of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In today s Catholicism and degraded Protestantism only a minority of people serves as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Catholicism there is a group of people called priests, and in Protestantism there is a group of people called pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These people specialize in serving God, that is, in being priests, but the rest of the people are not priests.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This condition is altogether unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s speaking in the New Testament clearly unveils that every believer is a priest of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God desires that all those who belong to Him would serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Old Testament shows that God s original intention was for all the children of Israel to serve Him as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to Exodus 19:6 God wanted them to be a kingdom of priests, a kingdom in which every Israelite would be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, because they worshipped the idol at the foot of Mount Sinai, they fell from God s goal, and God separated a group of people, the tribe of Levi, to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, there were two groups of people among the children of Israel the priests and the congregation, the rest of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the New Testament, however, God no longer wants such an abnormal situation to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has no intention of having a group of people who are priests and another group of people who are a congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, God desires all the believers to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in the New Testament, the saints are the priests, and the priests are saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, the Roman Catholic Church brought the degraded condition and system of Judaism into the church and divided the saints into two classes the clergy and the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was a great mistake and heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is sad that during the Reformation, Martin Luther did not completely purge out this evil influence of Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, in today s Protestantism there still remains the distinction between clergy and laity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even to this day in the English-speaking world, the title of Rev, meaning Reverend, is added to the name of pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a confounding heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This does not come from the New Jerusalem but is a product of Babylon the Great.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is also a great offense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One who serves God in a proper way could never bear the title Reverend .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although there are some among us who serve full time, this refers only to a way of service.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These ones are absolutely not clergy; hence, we should never add the title Reverend to their name or call them pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every believer is a saint, a holy person, that is, one who serves God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should never forget our status.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not saved to go to heaven but to be priests who serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we were saved, we may not have been clear that God did not save us to go to heaven but to be priests to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Going to heaven may have been sufficient for us, but God wants us to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, not only do we have the status of priests Rev 1:6 , but we are also a holy priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All believers are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The believers also have another status pertaining to service they are slaves of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are not merely servants of God; we are slaves of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being a servant is general, but being a slave is specific.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we speak of a slave, we are referring to a person who has sold himself to be a bondservant Exo 21:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Romans 6:22 and 1 Corinthians 7:22-23 say that we are slaves whom God bought with a great price.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is not only our God but also our Master.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As priests we must serve God devotedly, and as slaves we must serve Him faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have yet another status related to service we are members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Romans 12:4-5 says that we are members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since we are members of the Body, we have certain functions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just as every member in our body carries out its function, so also every member in the Body of Christ has its function.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This function is to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our statuses after salvation a priest, a slave, and a member of the Body of Christ speak forth our need to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These are our statuses for service.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>THE LIFE FOR SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Service is not only a matter of status but also a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the universe every life bears a certain characteristic and does certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Plant life produces flowers and bears fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Animal life also has a particular behavior and living.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is an unalterable law.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The life that we obtained through salvation is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This life also has its characteristics, one of which is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For this reason, whenever we lead a holy life, the life within us feels at ease, but whenever we do not lead a holy life, this life feels uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is because the life within us has the characteristic of being holy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Another characteristic of the life of Christ is love.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whenever we love others, the life within us feels comfortable, but whenever we hate and envy others, this life feels uneasy and uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Another characteristic of the life of Christ is serving.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The life of Christ is a serving life Mark 10:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If this serving life within us is not allowed to serve, we may feel like a bird that is locked in a cage and not allowed to fly.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is truly a suffering to the bird.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A characteristic of the bird s life is to fly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If a bird is released from a cage and allowed to fly freely, it will surely enjoy flying and have a wonderful time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Likewise, the more a Christian serves, the more he feels released inwardly, because a characteristic of the life of Christ is to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Acts 3:13 and 26 and 4:27 and 30 show that Christ is the Servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Philippians 2:7 says that when the Lord became a man, He took the form of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We often say that our Lord is the Lord of all, but we forget that He is also a Servant.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When He was on earth, He was a Servant.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Among the four Gospels, the Gospel of Mark speaks particularly of Him as a Servant.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In 10:45 the Lord said clearly that He did not come to be served, but to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This shows a characteristic of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we serve according to this characteristic, we will feel comfortable, free, released, and joyful within.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>On the contrary, if we do not allow this characteristic of serving to freely operate in us, we will definitely be unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Every believer has had this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we do not serve the Lord, we have no inward joy.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Serving the Lord is troublesome and may at times be burdensome, yet we inwardly feel joyful and comfortable because this is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This can be compared to eating.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Our need to eat adds many troubles to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It would be wonderful if we did not need to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, we must eat because it is a characteristic of life, a necessity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is the same with serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Although it is not simple or easy to serve the Lord, it is more of a suffering when we do not serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is because serving is a matter of life, a requirement of life, and a characteristic of life.</S>
