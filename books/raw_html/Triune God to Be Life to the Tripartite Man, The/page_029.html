<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Human Spirit<br>and the Consummated Divine Spirit<br>Becoming One Spirit&#151;the Mingled Spirit</H2><P>The human spirit and the consummated divine Spirit become one spirit. This one spirit is the mingled spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Believers Setting Their Mind<br>on the Mingled Spirit to Have Life</H2><P>The believers should learn to set their mind on the mingled spirit in order to have life (Rom. 8:6). We should not set our mind on our emotion, our will, or even our own thinking. We must set our mind on our mingled spirit. Within our spirit is the compound Spirit. Therefore, to set our mind on our spirit is to set our mind on the divine Spirit. When we set our mind on the mingled spirit, we receive life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Believers Walking<br>according to the Mingled Spirit</H2><P>The believers should walk according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4). We should walk, do things, and have our being according to the mingled spirit. As a result, we will have life, enjoy life, express life, and minister life all day long. This is the way for us as believers to enjoy and experience life.</P>
