   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Letter from Brother Witness Lee, Chefoo</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I left Peking for Tientsin at the beginning of October and spent two weeks conducting meetings at the chapel of the Evangelistic Crusade.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then I had a few days of meetings with the saints in Yao-Hwa Lane on the subject of the cross and life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the beginning of November, I left Tientsin for Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Chefoo I spoke with the brothers and sisters about the kingdom and the matter of testimony, and then I met with the co-workers for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The condition of the saints in Peking was quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In particular, the sisters seem to have experienced an inward revival.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Two sisters seem to have been called by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are both nurses and had discussed the matter of calling with Sister Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The time was not yet ripe for them then.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But now perhaps the time is ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Chao Chi-gwang has been raised up to join the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This brother studied at the Baptist Seminary in Hwang County.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now he is preaching the gospel around Si-Shiang.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Chang Tien-ren is now working for the Lord in Yi County.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They all came with Brothers Chang Tze-jieh, Kuo Bu-yueh, and Chao Bi-chen to meet with us in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then Brother Chang Tze-jieh went to Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is still there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother Chao Bi-chen went to Tsinan and intends to stay there for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Kuo Bu-yueh left for Tientsin and is now in Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Presently, four sister co-workers are in Chefoo Soong, Ang, Lee, and Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Concerning the literature work, we have not taken care of The Christian properly during the past few years the responsibility being mainly with me .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But more and more I have the inward feeling that this magazine is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May the Lord bless it and grant that it be published once every two months as scheduled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord has mainly shown me the truth of the kingdom during the last year.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Peking and Chefoo I have turned the attention of the brothers and sisters to the pursuit of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have the intention of making the next few issues of The Christian special issues, concentrating on the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I also feel to write on some simple subjects and something related to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Has Brother Nee left for the United States yet?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have not corresponded with him for a long time!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I wonder when he will be back.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I deeply desire to be taught by him again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I read one piece of news from a Brethren magazine, The Witness, which spoke of Mr. Nee's testimony for the Lord abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The listeners had a very good impression of him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I intend to prepare some articles for The Christian here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord willing, I will go to Tsingtao, Yi-Du, Gao-Mi, and Tsinan after the Chinese New Year and visit the brothers and sisters there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord's grace be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Witness Lee, January 17</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A Letter from Watchman Nee, England</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My work here has witnessed much blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I hope that everything bears eternal value before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>More and more I feel the need for the natural man to be bound.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we lose our freedom, we will have the power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you agree with me?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>My concern about the co-workers is that not too many know what their natural strength is, much less how to deny it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I sigh for purity for myself and seek to be without any mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May the Lord grant us the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>P.S. My concern all these years has been that brothers who have come in after us have not learned the cross; they do not know the corruption of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They lack the experience of the hollow of Jacob's thigh being touched.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They need revelation, and they need to be touched by God so that their flesh will experience an irreparable blow that makes them lame for the rest of their life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we passed through the Lord's dealings, we did not treasure these dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we see the need in others, we realize how much these dealings are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I intend to leave England for America on February 4.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am still translating Rethinking Our Work The Normal Christian Church Life .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I will return home from America.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If there is the need for me to return earlier, please write, and I will come back earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>My correspondence address is: c/o Thomas Look &amp; Son, Paris via Siberia.</S>
