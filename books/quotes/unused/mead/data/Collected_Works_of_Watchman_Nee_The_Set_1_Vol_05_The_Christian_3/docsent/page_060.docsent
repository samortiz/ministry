   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The title "Amen" here means that Christ is the One who accomplishes and affirms every thought and purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He is God's last word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is nothing more advanced or progressive than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the fullness dwells in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can find everything there is to find in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the basis of everything to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The failure of Laodicea arises when it tries to look for something apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This becomes the manifestation of their self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our riches and work can only be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God puts us into a life-union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has placed us in a position of absolute dependence so that we have to walk by Christ in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the end to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only by abiding in Him and doing what He commands will we see the word of God manifested in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to remember that the book of Colossians was also written to the Laodiceans.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the sins and sources of heresies arose when they did things "not according to Christ" Col 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The believers must reach the point where everything they do is according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether or not a thing is good, there must not be any independent action apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This will keep one from the mistake of Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Christ is all" Col 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, all apostasies and all failures come about when one departs from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If believers do gain something apart from Christ, they are doing good apart from the power of Christ and are leaving ground for the work of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All those who want to add anything apart from or after the Amen will lose the Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The meaning of Amen is "true and absolutely sure."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Isaiah 7:9 in the original language puts it well: "If ye will not amen, surely ye shall not have the amen."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that if they do not agree with His promises, they will not receive His praise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The duty of the church on earth is to affirm God's promises.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through the faith of the church the promises will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through the oneness of the church the promises will be established.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through the work of the church God's promises to the church and His punishments on the world will be proved to be real.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, because the church has forgotten its heavenly calling and has called the place where the Lord was killed its home, it has denied God's promises.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If God's promises are indeed glorious, why would one still be seeking after the world?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the world is to be judged and all that is not God's will pass away, why would one strive the same way as all the others do?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is what men will say.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The conduct of the church shows whether it is one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church may not have borne a heavenly testimony through the Holy Spirit, but God cannot be without a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, Christ reveals Himself as the Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2 He is also "the faithful and true Witness."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He reveals Himself in this way to show the vast difference between Himself and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church has failed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually the church has had nothing except failures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because the church has become unfaithful and unchaste, He is now rejecting its stand as a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church should have been a golden lampstand, shining and testifying for God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It should be manifested to be "a letter of Christ" 2 Cor 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But since it has considered itself rich, it can no longer be a testimony for the Lord who has nowhere to lay His head.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet His people's lack does not equal His lack.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"If we are faithless, He remains faithful" 2 Tim 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Soon He will arise and will bring in the day the world looks for.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In that day everything will be made manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even His faithfulness will be clearly revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now is the time to bear the testimony, but all the testimony of God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This resurrected and glorified Man is the faithful and true Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His presence in heaven today is a testimony to His death on earth before.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His death testifies that the fleshly man is fully corrupt and that God has no other way to deal with him except by judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His death also testifies to the great love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now a man has ascended to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to God's purpose before the foundation of the world, this man has now secured God's pleasure before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God's thought and grace toward man are all expressed in this ascended and glorified Man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the Witness of God's mind and motive.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God wants us to leave the corrupted and condemned place of Adam and to come to the accepted and blessed place of the glorified Man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All true witnesses, whether as a church or as individuals, must testify to what and how He is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church ought to continue the work of Christ and be a witness on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, it has utterly failed, while Christ has remained faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The witness of Christ will draw man's heart once more near to Him and to everything that God treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All those who will not be witnesses will be spewed out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christ shows in this letter how He is the faithful and true Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What a self-flattery it is that Laodicea considers itself beyond comparison!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But Christ considers it as most pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How different are the two views!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord first shows the kind of Witness He is so that they may realize that all His coming rebukes are true!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>3 He is also "the beginning of the creation of God."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is the cause of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>John has already mentioned this aspect of the Lord Jesus more than once John 1:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is, of course, related to the Lord's word in other passages: "I am the Alpha and the Omega...He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty" Rev 1:8 ; "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End" 22:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have mentioned before that these titles indicate that the Lord Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>These titles are also linked to Proverbs 8.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There the Lord Jesus is called Wisdom, the Wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Here it says that the Lord Jesus is the beginning of Jehovah's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It means the same as what is said in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, this does not mean that the Lord Jesus did not participate in the creation of the world itself because He existed even before all creation.</S>
