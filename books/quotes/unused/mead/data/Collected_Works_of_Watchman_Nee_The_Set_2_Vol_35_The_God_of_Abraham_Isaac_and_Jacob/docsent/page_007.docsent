   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE CALLING OF ABRAHAM Scripture Reading: Heb 11:8-10; Acts 7:2-5; Gal 3:8; Gen 11:31 12:3, 7a; 13:14-17; 14:21-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have mentioned previously that God desires to gain a group of men who are called by His name and who are His people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He wants to gain a group of people who can say that they belong to God and that they are God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to achieve this goal, He first worked on Abraham, then on Isaac, and finally on Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The experiences of Abraham plus Isaac plus Jacob are the basic experiences of all who desire to be God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that being God's people is not just a haphazard thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to be God's people, we must have some definite experiences in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to pass through certain dealings and certain trainings before we can become God's people and before we can truly live for God on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The basic experiences for being God's people are the experiences of Abraham, the experiences of Isaac, and the experiences of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, although many people can be called by God's name and outwardly be known as God's people, they are not qualified to become God's people unless they see that everything they have is from God, that everything is received, and that everything of the natural life has to be laid aside by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If they are not such persons, they cannot be of much use in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ABRAHAM BEING THE BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>OF THE RECOVERY WORK OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us come to the story of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All those who read the Bible will not fail to realize the importance of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His name is mentioned at the beginning of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus spoke of Abraham many times in His discourses; He did not mention Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He said, "Before Abraham came into being, I am" John 8:58 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not say, "Before Adam came into being, I am."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did not say to the Jews, "Your father Adam," but "Your father Abraham" v. 56 . He took Abraham as the starting point.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that Abraham is the starting point in God's plan of redemption and in His work of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 4 tells us that Abraham is the father of all those who believe v. 17 . Every believer has his beginning in Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The starting point is Abraham, not Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Adam is the beginning of sin; sin entered the world through one man 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That beginning was a corrupted beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though Abel offered sacrifices to God by faith, he was only a good person individually; we cannot receive blessing from him; hence, he is not the beginning of the recovery work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even though Enoch walked with God, he was also only a good individual; we cannot receive blessing from him; hence, he cannot be the beginning of the recovery work of God either.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Noah feared God, and his household entered the ark, but again he was only a good person individually; we cannot receive blessing from him; hence, he cannot be the beginning of the recovery work of God either.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All of these three persons were good, but they were only good individually.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham believed in God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But there is a difference between Abraham and Abel, Enoch, and Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Abraham occupies a much more important place in God's plan of redemption than do Abel, Enoch, and Noah because God's recovery work began with him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must see that Abraham is different from all the other men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From the time that Adam sinned, there has been a line of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although Abel was a good man, he could not deal with the line of sin; although Enoch was a good man, he could not deal with the tide of sin either; and although Noah was a good man, he could not change the sinful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man had become fallen and had failed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although these three men were good, they were good men as individuals only; they could not change the sinful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a great difference between being good individually and turning a situation around.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first time God used a man to turn the sinful situation was when He used Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before Abraham, God did some work in individuals, but He did not do anything to recover the sinful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first time God moved His hand to turn the sinful situation was in His selection of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, the first point of recovery was with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The tide of sin had been going on, and Abel, Enoch, and Noah were just three good rocks in the midst of this sinful torrent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Abraham was the first person through whom God turned the tide.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God raised up Abraham and through him brought in the work of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through him the Savior came and redemption came.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why the gospel in the New Testament begins with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we do not engage ourselves merely in the exposition of the Bible or in helping others to understand some Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We look to God's mercy to show us what God is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Redemption was accomplished by the Lord Jesus, yet its beginning was with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's recovery work has been continuing throughout the ages until today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It will continue until the time of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, the starting point was with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, the center of redemption is the Lord Jesus, and the consummation of redemption will be at the end of the millennium at the commencement of the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, the beginning of redemption was with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From the time of Abraham until the end of the millennium, God has been doing a work of recovery continually.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>During the long process of this work of recovery, the Lord Jesus Christ is the center, but we should never forget that the starting point was Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is what is special about Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's selection of Abraham was very different from His gracious dealings with Abel, Enoch, and Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When God gained Abel, He only gained Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When God gained Enoch, He only gained Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When God gained Noah, He only gained Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But when God chose Abraham, He did not gain just Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When Abraham was called, God told him clearly why he was called.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God told him to leave his country, his kindred, and his father's house and to go into the land of Canaan; He promised to make him a great nation in whom all the families of the earth would be blessed Gen 12:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In other words, the calling and choosing of Abraham was for the purpose of recovering a sinful situation; it was not for Abraham alone as an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Abraham was called because God wanted to use him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He was called to be a vessel and called for a work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was not called simply to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is one thing for a person to be called to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is another thing for a person to be called to transmit grace.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Abraham's calling was not just for him to receive grace, but for him to be a transmitter of grace.</S>
