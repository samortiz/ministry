<h1 class="title">Ambassadors of Christ<br />
and the Ministry of Reconciliation</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:16&mdash;6:2, 11-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The ministers of the new covenant are ambassadors of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 5:20a; Eph. 6:20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>An ambassador of Christ is one who represents God, the highest authority in the universe:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God has given all authority in heaven and on earth to Christ&mdash;Matt. 28:18.</li>
		<li>Jesus is the Christ&mdash;the Lord of all, the King of kings and the Lord of lords&mdash;the highest authority&mdash; Acts 2:36; 10:36; 1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 17:14; 19:16.</li>
		<li>The Lord needs some ambassadors on earth who are qualified to represent Him&mdash;Matt. 28:19.</li>
		<li>A new covenant minister is one who has been authorized with the heavenly authority to represent the highest authority&mdash;2 Cor. 3:6; 5:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The apostles were commissioned to represent Christ to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;Matt. 10:40; John 13:20; Gal. 4:14b.</li>
			<li>All the members of the Body are representatives of the Head, His ambassadors&mdash;Acts 9:6, 10-17; 22:12-16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As an ambassador of Christ, Paul was &ldquo;the acting God&rdquo;&mdash; 2 Cor. 1:3-4, 12, 15-16; 2:10; 10:1; 11:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul was one with Christ to be the acting God in comforting the believers&mdash;1:3-4.</li>
		<li>Paul conducted himself in the singleness of God, for he was an imitator of the simple God and lived God&mdash;v. 12.</li>
		<li>Paul&rsquo;s coming to the Corinthians was the coming of God as grace&mdash;vv. 15-16.</li>
		<li>Paul forgave a particular matter in the person of Christ&mdash;2:10.</li>
		<li>Paul entreated the believers through the meekness and gentleness of Christ&mdash;10:1.</li>
		<li>Paul was jealous over the saints with the jealousy of God&mdash;11:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As ambassadors of Christ, the new covenant ministers carry out the ministry of reconciliation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:18-20; 6:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The apostles were authorized by Christ to represent Him to do the work of reconciliation&mdash;5:18, 20.</li>
	<li>The ministry of reconciliation is not only to bring sinners back to God but also to bring believers absolutely into God and to make them absolutely one with Him.</li>
	<li>Two steps are required for men to be fully reconciled to God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first step is to reconcile sinners to God from sin&mdash;v. 19:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>For this purpose Christ died for our sins that we might be forgiven&mdash;1 Cor. 15:3.</li>
			<li>Christ bore our sins on the cross that they might be judged by God&mdash;1 Pet. 2:24.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The second step is to reconcile believers living in the natural life to God from the flesh&mdash;2 Cor. 5:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>For this purpose Christ died for us, the persons, that we might live to Him in the resurrection life&mdash;vv. 14-15.</li>
			<li>Christ was made sin on our behalf that sin might be judged and done away with&mdash;v. 21; Rom. 8:3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The two steps of reconciliation are portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle&mdash;Exo. 26:37, 31-35; Heb. 9:3; Matt. 27:51; Heb. 10:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we are to carry out the ministry of reconciliation, we need to be identified with the crucified Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 5:14; Gal. 2:20a; 5:24; 2 Cor. 4:10-12.</li>
	<li>The Corinthians still lived in the flesh, that is, in the soul, the outer man, the natural being&mdash;1 Cor. 3:1; 2:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The veil of the flesh, the natural man, separated them from God.</li>
		<li>Paul was working to cut asunder the separating veil of the flesh so that the believers at Corinth could enter into the Holy of Holies&mdash;Heb. 10:19-20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Only when we have been fully reconciled to God are we fully saved&mdash;2 Cor. 6:1-2; Rom. 5:10; Heb. 7:25.</li>
	<li>The extent to which we can bring others to God and into God is always measured by where we are with respect to God; the more we are in Him, the more we can reconcile others into Him&mdash;2 Cor. 12:12a; 5:20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The ministry of reconciliation brings us back to God to such an extent that we become the righteousness of God in Christ&mdash;v. 21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Not only are we justified by God (Gal. 2:16)&mdash;we actually become the righteousness of God.</li>
	<li>When Christ died on the cross as our Substitute, God considered Him not only the sin bearer but sin itself; now in resurrection Christ comes into us as life, and this life lives within us to constitute us into the righteousness of God.</li>
	<li>In substitution Christ was made sin for us; now in His constitution we become the righteousness of God in Him&mdash;2 Cor. 5:21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The phrase <em>in Him</em> means in union with Christ, not only positionally but also organically in resurrection.</li>
		<li>When Christ died on the cross, God condemned Him in the flesh as sin for us (Rom. 8:3; John 3:14) so that we might be one with Him in His resurrection to be God&rsquo;s righteousness; therefore, in the organic union with Christ we are made the righteousness of God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To become the righteousness of God in Christ is a matter of being right with God in our being; this is to have an inner being that is transparent and crystal clear&mdash;an inner being in the mind and will of God&mdash;2 Cor. 5:21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To be fully reconciled to God will cause us to be enlarged in our hearts; how large our heart is depends on the degree of our reconciliation to God&mdash;v. 20; 6:11-13.</li>
<li>Through the ministry of reconciliation, we are incorporated into the processed and consummated Triune God to become, in Christ, an enlarged, universal, divine-human incorporation; as a result, we become God&rsquo;s sanctuary, His dwelling place, His Holy of Holies&mdash;the New Jerusalem&mdash;John 14:20, 23; Rev. 21:2, 10, 16.</li>
