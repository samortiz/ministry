   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All these matters depend on a concern for others.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you feel that you are the elders, and that all you have to do is go to the meetings and make a few announcements, such an attitude will disqualify you from being an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>An elder should not wait for others to come and ask, but should have a constant concern for others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the last baptism, suppose eight brothers were assigned to my district.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a responsible one of this district, I should pay attention to these eight brothers concerning such matters as their family background, their marriages, and their educational background.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once I pay attention to them, I may find out that two young brothers are single and have recently graduated from college.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My concern must be diligent and stable as well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I must be very concerned for them and very attentive to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I must take note of the way they live and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps in the beginning, I may not have much assurance, but after observing them for a considerable period of time, up to a certain point I may have the assurance to find a match for them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you function in this way as an elder, in the long run the brothers and sisters cannot help but come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Surely they will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I really wish that the brothers and sisters in the church could come to the elders on any matter, whether large or small, spiritual, family, business, or having to do with one's daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That would truly be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In principle, the responsible ones for the districts should be the same as the elders; they should also care for the brothers and sisters as in a family.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a blessed work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have no idea how much blessing is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But please remember, this should not be something that we do out of our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The desire to be involved in others' business and to inquire about others' affairs is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The right way is for us to learn the lesson before the Lord and to accept a burden to be a shepherd among His children, one who cares for the souls of men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is because you love them and are concerned for them that you have such a burden upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If an elder can do this, the church will surely be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, the greatest lack in every local church is this kind of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such ones are not inquisitive concerning others' affairs, but they do have a character of being concerned for others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the right character that an elder should have in his shepherding and teaching of the church.</S>
