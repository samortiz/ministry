<H1 CLASS=TITLE>IN CHRIST</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A Message Given at a Baptismal Meeting)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 25</H2><P>We have to remember that we are all sinners because we are all in Adam. Everyone that is born of Adam has the Adamic nature. We do not need to make an effort to lose our temper, lie, etc., because Adam's nature, life, and behavior have all flowed into us. God's way of salvation is not by making us better but by delivering us out of Adam and putting us into Christ. Similarly, everything of Christ has flowed into us. The Bible shows that as long as we are in Adam, we will sin; and as long as we are in Christ, we are righteous. But in the most secret place of our heart, there is an erroneous desire. We wish that God would do something on us. Many people make this kind of mistake. However, God never does anything on us; rather, He puts us into Christ.</P><P>Some people think that because the root of sin is still in us even though we are saved, we need to ask God to do another thing on us: to remove the root of sin in us like pulling out a bad tooth. Perhaps someone has said that we need to pray to ask God to pull out the root of our sin. Perhaps some have said that after they prayed for a certain period of time, they succeeded and were sanctified. But if we expect God to accomplish something on us, this will never happen. The Bible shows us that all of God's work has been accomplished in Christ. Since the day Christ died, every spiritual thing has been accomplished in Christ. God will not do any more. If we ask God to perform a work on us, God cannot. We can only receive what God has already accomplished in Christ.</P><P>Everything is in Christ. Do not hope to receive some special light while you are praying or hear some voice telling you that a certain sin has been removed. Do not expect to have a special feeling that will fill you with joy. You may think that these are good things. Actually, thinking this way involves an evil heart of unbelief. This is not God's work. Whatever God does has been done in Christ; it is not done in you. It is not a matter of what God does on you; God has done everything in Christ. If you believe, you will have it. But if you want God to do something on you, you will never have it done. When you are in Christ, you have what is in Christ by receiving.</P><P>Many times when you are ill, you wish that God would just touch you with His little finger so that you would be healed. However, God has healed you in Christ; God cannot do anything on you again. As long as you are in Christ and receive, you will have what you need. Once you believe, the healing is yours. Do you want to be victorious? You can never do it! Only Christ is victorious. Do you want to overcome the world? You can never do it! Only Christ overcomes the world. Do you wish that God would do something? God will never do it because He has already done everything in Christ. Do you think that overcoming is something that only happens today? No, it happened when Christ overcame. May God grant us the light of revelation and show us what is already in Christ. If we do not have faith, we will have nothing; but if we have faith, we will have everything. In Christ there is victory, justification, holiness, forgiveness, as well as all the other spiritual blessings. God will not work these things on us again. If we enter into Christ, all that is in Christ will be ours. This does not mean that we extract something from Christ for our nourishment. Rather, it is entering into Christ and letting everything in Christ flow into us.</P><P>When we are baptized, we are baptized into Christ. Not only are we immersed into the water, we are also immersed into Christ. The second part of Romans 6:3, "Baptized into His death," indicates that the baptismal water refers to death. The first part of this verse, "Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus," indicates that the water also refers to Christ. Many times we think that God gives us a glass of water to drink. Instead, God wants us to enter into Christ. If we see this clearly, we will know that we do not have to ask God to do something on us. It is done in Christ. Everything is in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT DO WE HAVE IN CHRIST?</H2><P>Romans 8:1 says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus." You cannot be condemned, because you are in Christ. Can you say to God, "I am a sinner, please forgive me and do not condemn me"? No. God cannot do this. God forgives you in Christ. You need not look at yourself. You only need to look at Christ. How do you know that you will not be condemned in the future? Can you rely upon your experience of a certain day or a certain time? The only way you can stop me from rebutting you is by quoting the Scripture. If you quote the Scripture, no preacher on earth can rebut you. Even God cannot rebut you because His Word says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus."</P><P>Second Corinthians 5:17 says, "So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new." Does this verse tell us that we are changed? No, it says that he who is in Christ is a new creation. Some say, "I was a Christian for many years but was very weak. But on a certain day of a certain year, I was revived and became a new creation." What evidence does he have that he became a new creation on a certain day of a certain year? My evidence is not a so-called revival which supposedly made me a new creation; my evidence is God's Word which says that whoever is in Christ is a new creation. Perhaps some may say, "According to the Bible, I am in Christ, and I am a new creation. However, when I look at myself, I do not seem so new." I can say that sinners and even many Christians do not have faith. After reading this you should kneel down and say, "God, I thank and praise You; Your Word says that whoever is in Christ is a new creation. I am in Christ; therefore, I am a new creation!" Whenever temptation befalls you and tells you that you are still an old creation, you should say, "God's Word says that whoever is in Christ is a new creation." If you do this, Satan will retreat. If you pay no attention to the temptation and only stand on the side of God's Word, you will overcome. Overcoming does not depend upon feeling but upon God's Word.</P>
