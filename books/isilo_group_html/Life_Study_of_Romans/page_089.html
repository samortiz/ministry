ISRAEL RESTORED THROUGH<br />THE NATIONS&rsquo; MERCY</h2><p>&ldquo;And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again. For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more shall these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). Although Paul seems to be speaking on behalf of the Gentiles, he is actually more in favor of the Jews because he was a Jew himself. Underlying his words concerning the Gentiles is his burden for the Jews.</p><p>&ldquo;For I do not want you, brothers, to be ignorant of this mystery, lest you be wise in yourselves, that hardness has come upon a part of Israel until the fullness of the nations comes in&rdquo; (v. 25). The &ldquo;fullness of the nations&rdquo; refers to the converts among the Gentiles. Now is the time when a great many Gentiles will be converted. Hence, the &ldquo;fullness of the nations&rdquo; has not yet been completed; it is continuing at the present time. The &ldquo;fullness of the nations&rdquo; is different from the phrase &ldquo;until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled&rdquo; (Luke 21:24). Some Christians confuse these two phrases. The words &ldquo;until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled&rdquo; denote the prophecy regarding the termination of Gentile power; &ldquo;the fullness of the nations&rdquo; denotes the completeness of the conversion among the nations.</p><p>In verse 26 Paul declares, &ldquo;And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come out of Zion, He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.&rdquo; At that time all the remaining Israelites will be saved. &ldquo;And this is the covenant from Me to them, when I take away their sins. According to the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but according to the selection they are beloved for the fathers&rsquo; sake&rdquo; (vv. 27-28). Notice the two &ldquo;sakes&rdquo; in verse 28: &ldquo;your sake&rdquo; and the &ldquo;fathers&rsquo; sake.&rdquo; They are enemies for our sake, but beloved for the fathers&rsquo; sake. &ldquo;For the free gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable&rdquo; (v. 29). God&rsquo;s gifts and God&rsquo;s calling are eternal, without repentance, without change. Once God&rsquo;s gift is given, it is given forever. Once God has called us, He has called us for eternity. He would never repent of His gifts and calling. How we thank God that &ldquo;with Him there is no variation&rdquo; (James 1:17, Gk.). &ldquo;For just as you once disobeyed God, but now have obtained mercy through their disobedience, so these also now have disobeyed that through your mercy they also now may obtain mercy. For God has shut up all in disobedience that He might show mercy to all&rdquo; (vv. 30-32). Here we see that Paul uses both disobedience and mercy as means for his argument. Man&rsquo;s disobedience affords God&rsquo;s mercy an opportunity, and God&rsquo;s mercy brings man salvation. Thus, we see once again that Paul has won every case. God has shut up all in disobedience that He might show mercy to all. This is God&rsquo;s economy. What can we say? All that we can say is, &ldquo;Hallelujah for His mercy!&rdquo; He has even used our disobedience as an enclosure to keep us as vessels upon whom He shows His mercy.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. A PRAISE FOR GOD&rsquo;S SELECTION</h2><p>At this point Paul lifted up a praise to God, a praise for God&rsquo;s selection. &ldquo;O the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How inscrutable are His judgments and untraceable His paths! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been His counselor? Or who has first given to Him, and it will be repaid to him? Because out of Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen&rdquo; (vv. 33-36). It seems that in Romans 9 through 11 Paul has given us a map by which we may trace God&rsquo;s paths. God receives praise and glory in three stages: in the past, for all things have come out of Him; in the present, for all things are through Him; and in the future, for all things will be to Him. All things came into being out of God in the past, all things exist through Him in the present, and all things will be to Him in the future. God&rsquo;s selection is according to Himself, according to His choice, not according to anything else. All things are of Him, by Him, and for Him. &ldquo;To Him be the glory forever. Amen.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_088.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_090.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Romans &nbsp; pg 89</div><br></body></html>
