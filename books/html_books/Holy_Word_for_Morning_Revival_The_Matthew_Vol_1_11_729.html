The New Testament at its beginning presents four biographies to portray the four main aspects of this all-inclusive Christ. The Gospel of Matthew testifies that He is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of the heavens to the earth. The Gospel of Mark tells us that He is the Servant of God, laboring for God faithfully. Mark&#8217;s account is most simple, for a servant does not warrant a detailed record. The Gospel of Luke presents a full picture of Him as the only proper and normal man who ever lived on this earth; as such a man, He is the Savior of mankind. The Gospel of John unveils Him as the Son of God, the very God Himself, who is life to God&#8217;s people. Among the four Gospels, Matthew and Luke have a record of genealogy; Mark and John do not. To testify that Jesus is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, Matthew needs to show us the antecedents and status of this King, to prove that He is the proper successor to the throne of David. To prove that Jesus is a proper and normal man, Luke needs to show the generations of this man, to attest that He is qualified to be the Savior of mankind. For the record of a servant, Mark does not need to tell us His origin. To unveil that Jesus is the very God, neither does John need to give us His human genealogy; rather, he declares that, as the Word of God, He is the very God in the beginning.</p><p>1<sup>2</sup> In the genealogy of Jesus given by Luke, which proves that He is a proper man, the title Christ is not mentioned (Luke 3:23-38). But in the genealogy of Christ given here by Matthew, which proves that He is the King, the Christ of God, the title Christ is emphasized repeatedly (vv. 1, 16-17).</p><p>1<sup>3</sup> Solomon is a type of Christ as the son of David, the One who inherits the throne and kingdom of David (2 Sam. 7:12-13; Luke 1:32-33). Solomon, as a type of Christ, did mainly two things: he built the temple of God in the kingdom (1 Kings 6:2) and spoke the word of wisdom (1 Kings 10:23-24; Matt. 12:42). Christ, in fulfilling this type, is now building the real temple of God, the church, in the kingdom of God and has spoken the word of wisdom.</p><p>1<sup>4</sup> Isaac is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the One who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham (Gen. 22:17-18; Gal. 3:16, 14). Isaac also, as a type of Christ, did mainly two things: he obeyed his father even unto death and was resurrected from death (Gen. 22:9-10; Heb. 11:19), and he took Rebekah, a Gentile woman, as his wife (Gen. 24:61-67). Christ, in fulfilling this type, was put to death and offered to God and was resurrected from death, and He is taking the church as His bride out of the Gentiles.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The Bible is God&#8217;s speaking....In the...Old Testament, God spoke by the prophets, and in...the New Testament, He spoke in the Son (in the person of the Son, Heb. 1:1-2).</p><p>With every book of the Bible we need a general sketch. The general sketch of Matthew is: Christ is Jehovah God incarnated to be the King-Savior who came to establish the kingdom of the heavens (the heavenly rule) by saving His people from sin (of rebellion) through His death and resurrection.

[His] generation not only includes the high-ranking people, but also the civilians, the insignificant ones, like Mary and Joseph. The poor people, the little people, are also included in the generation of Christ....This generation includes both the called ones, like Abraham, and the ones carried away to captivity....This generation includes Jeconiah, a king who was dethroned and deported to Babylon as a captive. Have you ever been dethroned? Do not think you have not. In your Christian life you sometimes have been dethroned. Once you were a king, but you lost your kingship and became a backslider.</p><p>After captivity there was the recovery. Hence, we have another name, Zerubbabel, the name of recovery....You were an Abraham, you became a Jeconiah, but today you are a Zerubbabel. We are all Zerubbabels. We are the called ones, the fallen ones, and the recovered ones.</p><p>According to Jewish custom, a writer of a genealogy would never include a female name; he would include only the names of males. But in this brief genealogy five women are mentioned: [Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, her who had been the wife of Uriah, and Mary]....Four of these five women were remarried, and one of the four was a harlot....Why does this brief record mention all these women? It is because they are our representatives. Do not think you are...more pure than these women....We are worse. But the worst ones are included in the generation of Christ! Praise the Lord! He is truly the Savior of sinners....If we were to write a biography of Christ...we would hide all these impure grandmothers and give the names of the good grandmothers, such as Sarah and Rebekah. But the Holy Spirit did not mention...all the good ones; however, He purposely included these impure ones....Besides the four remarried women, a virgin stands out: Mary, the mother of Jesus. Mary was good, pure, and clean. This indicates that everyone mentioned in this book of generation is a sinner except Jesus.</p><p>This book of generation says...that Christ is the son of David and the son of Abraham....As the son of David, He is for the Jews; as the son of Abraham, He is for us all....All nations are blessed in Abraham&#8217;s seed, which is Christ. This blessing is the participation in the Triune God. The blessing which God promised to Abraham was the Spirit (Gal. 3:14), and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the Triune God. By Christ as the son of Abraham, we have the Spirit, and we share in the Triune God. Hallelujah!

Hence, the genealogy of Christ in Matthew begins with Abraham, the father of the called race, not with Adam, the father of the created race. God&#8217;s kingdom is not built with the created race of Adam but with the called race of Abraham, which includes both the real Israelites (Rom. 9:6-8) and the believers in Christ (Gal. 3:7, 9, 29).</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In the first ten and a half chapters of Genesis God tried to work with the created race, but He did not get through. The created race failed Him....Out of a place filled with rebellion and idolatry, a place where everyone was one with Satan, God called a man named Abraham (Gen. 12:1-2; Heb. 11:8). From the time God called him out of Babel (later Babylon) into Canaan, God gave up the adamic race and invested all His interest in this new race, with Abraham as its head. This is the called race, the transformed race. It is not a race according to nature, but a race according to faith.</p><p>Abraham, as a called one, was justified by faith (Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:2-3). The fallen ones depend on their work, but the called ones believe in God&#8217;s work, not in their own work....They trust in God&#8217;s work of grace.</p><p>Hebrews 11:8 says that Abraham was called, and that he answered this call by faith....Then, verse 9 says that he also lived in the good land by faith. For Abraham to live and walk by faith meant that he had to reject himself, to forget himself, to set himself aside, and to live by Someone else. Whatever he had by nature had to be set aside.</p><p>Galatians 3 says that we are the sons of Abraham and that we should live by faith, not by our works. Galatians 2:20 says that to live by faith means &#8220;it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ.&#8221;...This is Abraham.</p><p>The fallen race always likes to do something, to work and to exert some effort. But God says, &#8220;Come out of that. You are the called race. Don&#8217;t try, don&#8217;t do, and don&#8217;t work any more! Forget your past. Forget what you are, what you can do, and what you have. Forget everything, and put your full trust in Me. I am your good land. Live in Me, and live by Me.&#8221;...These are the ones who make up the generation of Christ.</p><p>At a certain time the Lord asked Abraham to offer Isaac, the one God had given according to His promise, for a burnt offering (Gen. 22:1-2)....Are you able to do this? What a difficult lesson this is! Nevertheless, this is the way to experience Christ. Last month or last week you may have experienced Christ in a certain way, but today the Lord says, &#8220;Consecrate that experience. That was a real experience of Christ, but don&#8217;t keep it.&#8221; Again, the lesson is to never trust in what we have, not even in what God has given us. If God has given you something, it must be given back to Him. This is the daily walk by faith....Do not keep anything as something to rely on; rely only and always on the Lord.

The double portion of the land went to Joseph through his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim (Josh. 16-17); the priesthood went to Levi (Deut. 33:8-10); and the kingship was given to Judah (Gen. 49:10; 1 Chron. 5:2).

It is impossible for me to bring forth a child....I have a maid named Hagar....Surely you could have a son by her&#8221; (Gen. 16:1-2)....Many times our natural concept has some proposal to get us out of the spirit....Abraham took Sarah&#8217;s proposal (Gen. 16:2-4), and the result was Ishmael (Gen. 16:15)....Participating in Christ requires that we never rely on our own effort nor on anything we are able to do....The termination of our natural effort...is &#8220;Isaac,&#8221; the inheriting of God&#8217;s promised blessing, which is Christ.</p><p>Verse 2 also says, &#8220;Isaac begot Jacob.&#8221;...When [Jacob] and his older brother Esau were coming out of the womb, Jacob held Esau&#8217;s heel. Jacob seemed to be saying, &#8220;Esau, don&#8217;t go yet!...Let me go first!&#8221; Jacob was a real heel-holder. The meaning of the name Jacob is the heel-holder, the supplanter....Because God had already chosen Jacob, all his endeavors were in vain. Jacob needed a vision. He did not need to supplant others, because God had chosen him.... What did Jacob need? He needed God&#8217;s dealing....There was a great deal of suffering in the life of Jacob, but this suffering came from his striving, not from God&#8217;s election....[According to] Romans 9,...it is up to Him, not us....What a mercy that we have been selected to be associated with Christ and to participate in Him as God&#8217;s eternal blessing!</p><p>Jacob&#8217;s supplanting was not justified, but his seeking after the birthright surely was honored by God. Esau despised the birthright and sold it cheaply (Gen. 25:29-34).... He had lost the blessing of participating in Christ. This should be a warning to us.

From the lives of all these persons, we can discover certain principles which govern our association with Christ.</p><p>[First,] we shall consider...Tamar. Tamar conceived through committing incest with her father-in-law (Gen. 38:6-27)....The fault was...on the side of her father-in-law, Judah, who admitted that she was more righteous than he (Gen. 38:26)....Although Tamar may be held responsible to a certain extent, she was righteous, and she had a heart for the birthright....The significance...today is that if we care for Christ and are seeking Him, any way we can truly gain Him is the right way. [Following this, is Tamar&#8217;s] son, Pharez (v. 3). Tamar conceived twins (Gen. 38:27-30). At the time of delivery, one boy, Zarah, tried to come out first, but he did not succeed....Pharez preceded him to be the firstborn. Thus, the first became the last, and the last became the first....Pharez inherited the birthright....This proves that it is not up to man&#8217;s endeavoring; it is up to God&#8217;s choice.</p><p>We proceed to Rahab (v. 5). Rahab was a harlot in Jericho (Josh. 2:1), [yet]...she became a grandmother of Christ. How could [this be?]...To answer this question, we need to find the principles. The entire population of Jericho was destroyed except Rahab, her family, and her possessions. She was saved because she turned to God and God&#8217;s people (Josh. 6:22-23, 25; Heb. 11:31).</p><p>[Next is] Boaz...a type of Christ, and Ruth is a type of the church....Boaz redeemed Ruth; he also redeemed the birthright for her....Boaz redeemed his kinsman&#8217;s inheritance and married the man&#8217;s widow (Ruth 4:1-17); hence, he became a notable forefather [and]...great associate of Christ. As a brother and a Boaz, you should [daily] take care of others&#8217; birthright [enjoyment] of Christ, not only your own.</p><p>We come now to Ruth (1:5)....Ruth belonged to the tribe of Moab (Ruth 1:4)....The Moabites were forbidden to enter the congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth generation [Deut. 23:3]. [But] Ruth...was seeking God and God&#8217;s people (Ruth 1:15-17; 2:11-12). This reveals a most prevailing principle: no matter who we are or what our background is, as long as we have a heart which seeks after God and God&#8217;s people, we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ.</p><p>We continue with Jesse (vv. 5-6)....Jesse is a person who brings forth Christ, who branches out Christ by being rooted in Christ [see Isa. 11:1, 10]....Christ is our source, and Christ is also our issue....[We move on to] David...the eighth son of his father....In the Bible the number eight signifies resurrection, a new start....David was the last of the generations of the fathers, [and] also the first of the generations of the kings. [To]...have the rich enjoyment of Christ,...often [requires us]...to be the end of one situation and the beginning of another situation.</p><p>After David committed murder and adultery, he...repented....David repented and God forgave....Altogether we have three items here: transgression, repentance, and forgiveness. If we put all three together, the result is Solomon....The church is always built up by this kind of person, Solomon, the issue of man&#8217;s transgression and repentance plus God&#8217;s forgiveness.

First Chronicles 3:5 tells us that Nathan and Solomon were two different persons. Luke&#8217;s record is the genealogy of David&#8217;s son Nathan, who was Mary&#8217;s forefather, whereas Matthew&#8217;s record is the genealogy of David&#8217;s son Solomon, who was Joseph&#8217;s forefather. One genealogy is the line of Mary, the line of the wife; the other is the line of Joseph, the line of the husband. Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David. Under God&#8217;s sovereignty they were joined together by marriage, so that through Mary, Joseph was indirectly associated with Christ. Christ can be counted as a descendant of David through either Solomon or Nathan. Hence, He has two genealogies.</p><p>Strictly, Solomon was not a direct forefather of Christ. His relationship with Christ was indirect, through the marriage of Joseph, his descendant, to Mary, of whom Christ was born (v. 16). The Old Testament did not say that Christ would be Solomon&#8217;s descendant, but it prophesied repeatedly that Christ would be a descendant of David (2 Sam. 7:13-14; Jer. 23:5).</p><p>12<sup>1</sup> Zerubbabel was one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from the captivity in Babylon (Ezra 5:1-2). He was also a leader in the rebuilding of God&#8217;s temple (Zech. 4:7-10). The Old Testament predicted that Christ, as a descendant of David, would be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2; Matt. 2:4-6). Without the return from captivity, it would not have been possible for Christ to be born in Bethlehem....Christ needed some people to be in the proper place to bring Him to earth the first time. Similarly, for His second coming Christ needs some of His people to return from their captivity to the proper church life.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The generation of Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus [see chart in RcV, p. 11].</p><p>[Matthew 1:17] mentions three groups of fourteen generations.

Luke presents Him as the only proper and normal man to be the Savior of mankind, and John unveils Him as the Son of God, the very God Himself, who is life to God&#8217;s people.</p><p>Among the four Gospels only two, Matthew and Luke, have genealogies. Matthew tells us that Jesus is the proper descendant of the royal family, that He is the legal heir of the royal throne. Luke presents Jesus as a proper, normal man, which also requires a genealogy.</p><p>When we come to the genealogy of Jesus in Matthew we need to realize who Jesus is. This genealogy calls Him the son of David and the son of Abraham. Jesus is the mingling of God with man, the mingling of divinity with humanity. This is the generation of Jesus. In this generation we have the mingling of the divine Being with so many human beings.</p><p>The kingdom, of which Christ is the King, is composed of Abraham&#8217;s descendants, including both his descendants in the flesh and those in faith. Hence, the genealogy of Christ in Matthew begins with Abraham, the father of the called race, not with Adam, the father of the created race. The genealogy of Christ includes all kinds of people: good ones, bad ones, called ones, fallen ones, and recovered ones. From the lives of all these persons, we can discover certain principles that govern our association with Christ. No matter what we are or where we came from, we can be included in the generation of Christ if we fulfill the principles.</p><p>In Christ we need, first, the life of Abraham. We need to forget what we are, live by Christ, and trust in Him. Second, in Christ, we have no need of Ishmael, our doing; we need Isaac, His doing. Further, we do not need the supplanting, striving, natural Jacob, but the transformed Israel, realizing that it is absolutely due to the Lord&#8217;s mercy that we have been selected to be associated with Christ. We continue with Boaz. He redeemed Ruth as well as the birthright for her. Daily, we should take care of others&#8217; birthright and enjoyment of Christ, not only our own. Next is Ruth. As Ruth, if we have a heart that seeks after God and God&#8217;s people, then we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ. Following Ruth, through Jesse we see that Christ must be our source and our issue. Proceeding to Jesse&#8217;s son, David, we see that living in resurrection will often require us to be the end of one situation and the beginning of another. Finally, Solomon was the issue of man&#8217;s transgression and repentance plus God&#8217;s forgiveness. The church is always built up by this kind of person.</p><p>All the generations were directed toward Christ and brought forth Christ. Christ is the forty-second generation. Forty-two signifies rest and satisfaction after trials. Without Christ, there are just forty-one generations; there is no goal, no consummation, and no conclusion. Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations, fulfilling their prophecies, solving their problems, and meeting their needs. He is everything to us. Hallelujah, Christ has come!</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 2 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 1:18, 20-21</h2><p class="bold">18 &nbsp;Now the origin of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, Mary, after she had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with child <sup>1</sup>of the Holy Spirit.</p><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been <sup>1</sup>begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>21 &nbsp;And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name <sup>1</sup>Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>18<sup>1</sup> Lit., out of. Although Christ was born of Mary (v. 16), He was a child of the Holy Spirit. The birth of Christ was directly of the Holy Spirit (v. 20). His source was the Holy Spirit and His element was divine. Through the virgin Mary He put on flesh and blood, the human nature, taking the likeness of the flesh (Rom. 8:3), the likeness of men (Phil. 2:7).</p><p>20<sup>1</sup> God was first born into Mary through His Spirit; after the conception was completed, He, with the human nature, was born to be a God-man, possessing both divinity and humanity. This is the origin of Christ.</p><p>21<sup>1</sup> Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua (Num. 13:16), which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah. Hence, Jesus is not only a man but Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation. Thus, He is our Savior. He is also our Joshua, the One who brings us into rest (Heb. 4:8; Matt. 11:28-29), which is Himself as the good land to us.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The birth of Christ was prepared and carried out by God&#8217;s sovereignty (1:8; Luke 1:26-27)....If the forefathers of Joseph and Mary had remained in Babylon...how could Jesus have been born...in Bethlehem? Now we can see God&#8217;s sovereignty in bringing back the [ancestors]...of both Joseph and Mary [Matt. 1:12; Ezra 5:1-2.] By His sovereignty, God placed both Joseph and Mary in the same city, Nazareth (Luke 1:26; 2:4). [Even more,] by His sovereignty, God brought Joseph and Mary together in marriage to bring forth Christ to be the legal heir to the throne of David.</p><p>According to Luke 1:26-38, the birth of Christ was carried out through Mary&#8217;s surrender....It was not easy for a young virgin like Mary to accept the commission to conceive a child....Mary might have said, &#8220;Gabriel, don&#8217;t you know that I am espoused to a man already? How can I conceive a child?&#8221; After listening to the angel, Mary said, &#8220;Behold the slave of the Lord. May it happen to me according to your word&#8221; (Luke 1:38)....To bring forth Christ Mary paid a very high price-the cost of her whole being.</p><p>However, Mary&#8217;s surrender was not directly related to the conceiving of Jesus. The conceiving of Jesus was directly related to the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35)....Our surrender means little; it simply affords the opportunity for the Holy Spirit&#8217;s power to come into us and accomplish something.</p><p>Although there was the sovereignty of God, the surrender of Mary, and the power of the Holy Spirit, there was the need of Joseph&#8217;s obedience and coordination (Matt. 1:19-21, 24-25). What would have happened if Joseph had insisted on a divorce?...Because at that time Joseph was a young man, I would take this opportunity to say a word to the young people: Do not make decisions too fast or act too quickly. Be a little slow and give the Lord a chance to come in. To take such a woman would surely be a shame. Therefore,...Joseph also paid a price. The bringing forth of Christ cost him a great deal, for it caused him to suffer shame.

[First,] the name Jesus includes the name Jehovah...[which] means I Am-I Am Who I Am (Exo. 3:14). The verb &#8220;to be&#8221; in Hebrew not only refers to the present, but also includes both the past and the future. Hence, the correct meaning of Jehovah is I Am Who I Am, the One who is now in the present, who was in the past, and who will be in the future and in eternity forever....Because the name of the Lord is the I Am, we may say, &#8220;Lord, You told me that Your name is I Am. Then, what are You?&#8221; His answer will be, &#8220;I am whatever you need.&#8221; The [second] element included in the name of Jesus is...the Savior. Jesus is Jehovah-Savior, the One who saves us from all negative things. [Third,] Jesus is not only the Savior, He Himself is also our salvation. Do not ask Him to give you salvation. Instead, you should say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, come to me and be my salvation.&#8221;</p><p>The name of Jesus is above every name (Phil. 2:9-10).... [The] exalted name of Jesus is for us to do many things. Firstly, the name of Jesus is for us to believe in (John 1:12)....We should not only say that we believe in the Lord Jesus, but also declare that we believe in the name of Jesus....The name of Jesus is for us to be baptized into (Acts 8:16; 19:5)....To be baptized into the name of Jesus means to be baptized into His Person....The name of Jesus is also for us to be saved. Acts 4:12 says, &#8220;Neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.&#8221; [Both Acts 3:6 and 4:10 testify] that the name of Jesus is also a healing name....The name of Jesus has been given to us so that we may be washed, sanctified, and justified (1 Cor. 6:11)....If the name of Jesus were an empty name, how could it wash...sanctify and justify us? This would be impossible. However, this name is linked to the Spirit. The Spirit is the Person of the name and the reality of the name. Therefore the name can wash us, sanctify us, and justify us. The Spirit is one with the name. Jesus is the name of the Lord, and the Spirit is the Person of the Lord....The name of Jesus is for us to call upon (Rom. 10:13; 1 Cor. 1:2)....If you call on His name, you will taste Him and enjoy Him....Because Satan and all his demons hate the name of Jesus, we must proclaim it all the more....Moreover, we must learn to suffer for this name [Acts 5:41; 15:26, and]...never deny the name of Jesus [Rev. 3:8].</p><p>Now we come to the second name, Emmanuel (1:23).... When we experience Jesus, He is Emmanuel, God with us....Whenever we are gathered together into the name of Jesus, He is with us (18:20)....Jesus is with us all the days, even until the consummation of the age (28:20)....Jesus is not only among us; He is in our spirit [2 Tim. 4:22].</p><p>According to Isaiah 8:7-8, the enemy may try to take over the land of Emmanuel. [But] Isaiah 8:10 tells us that because God is with us, the enemy can never take over the land of Emmanuel. Although Satan has tried his best to take you over...you are still here because of Emmanuel, because of God with us. This Emmanuel is Jesus.

After the wise men experienced the vision of the heavenly star, they got into trouble. This trouble came from their natural concept....The wise men saw the vision and... assumed that they should go to Jerusalem...(vv. 1-2). Their decision to go to Jerusalem did not come from the light of the star....Jerusalem was the wrong place....Their error cost the lives of many young ones (vv. 16-18). Be careful: you may have the Bible and the star, but do not follow your natural concept....How about today&#8217;s situation? Many are very scriptural, but they care only for the Scriptures, not for the living Christ....We all need to pray, &#8220;Lord, give me a heart for You. I want to see the vision and I want to know the Bible. But even more, I want to have a heart that seeks You.&#8221;</p><p>Now we must see how we can have this star, how we can have this heavenly vision. The Bible tells us that the living star is Christ. It was prophesied that Christ would be the star (Num. 24:17), He came as the star (Matt. 2), and He remains as the star (Rev. 22:16). He is shining....According to 2 Peter 1:19, the star is associated with the Bible. Peter tells us to take heed to the &#8220;prophetic word made more firm.&#8221; If we take heed to this firm word, something within us will dawn, and the morning star will rise in our hearts....Today there are only two ways to have the star shining over you. According to the first way, you must come to the sure Word and open up your whole being to the Word-your mouth, your eyes, your mind, your spirit, and your heart-until something rises up in you and shines over you. That is Christ. The second way is to come to the shining saints, the followers of Christ. If you come to them, you will receive light...for they will lead you to the place where Christ is. Both ways of having the star are linked to the Spirit and the church [see Rev. 22:16-17a; 3:1; 1:20].

It was through that census that Christ was born in Bethlehem (Luke 2:4-7) to fulfill the prophecy concerning His birth (Micah 5:2). He stayed there a short time. Then, because of Herod&#8217;s persecution He was taken to Egypt (vv. 13-15), and subsequently He was brought back to the land of Israel (vv. 19-21). Because of Archelaus&#8217;s reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, Christ was brought to Nazareth, a despised city of Galilee (vv. 22-23; John 1:45-46), and was raised there. He was born in the esteemed town of Bethlehem but grew up in the despised city of Nazareth. Hence, He was called a Nazarene. To follow Christ requires that we heed not only the Scriptures concerning Him but also the instant leadings, such as those Joseph had in his dreams. Caring only for the Scriptures while neglecting the instant leadings may cause us to miss Christ, as did the Jewish priests and scribes.

It was accomplished through Mary&#8217;s surrender (Luke 1:26-38), the conceiving power of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35), and Joseph&#8217;s obedience and coordination (Matt. 1:19-21, 24-25). From Joseph we should learn that in the midst of trouble and misunderstanding we should not make decisions too fast; rather, give the Lord a chance to come in.</p><p>The last part of Matthew 1 deals with the names of Jesus and Emmanuel. Jesus was the name given by God, whereas Emmanuel was the name called by man. Three elements are in the name of Jesus. 1) Jehovah-&#8220;I Am Who I Am&#8221; (Exo. 3:14), 2) Savior, and 3) Salvation. Emmanuel is the second name (1:23). When we experience Jesus, He is Emmanuel, God with us. Jesus is not only among us; He is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). As the Spirit, He dwells in our spirit. The Spirit is simply the reality of Jesus&#8217; presence (John 14:16-20). This presence is Emmanuel, God with us.</p><p>The way to find Christ is revealed in Matthew 2. We need to follow the living vision, the heavenly star. Although the Jewish religionists were for the knowledge of the Bible, they were not for the living person of the Messiah. We all need to pray, &#8220;Lord, give me a heart for You. I want to see the vision and I want to know the Bible. But even more, I want to have a heart that seeks You.&#8221;</p><p>Matthew 3 covers the recommendation and anointing of the King. He was recommended by one whose coming terminated the dispensation of law and began the dispensation of grace. John&#8217;s message was, &#8220;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&#8221; (Matt. 3:2). Repentance means a change of mind. To repent unto the Lord with our whole being and with our whole heart and to let the Lord come in is to prepare the way of the Lord.</p><p>The Lord &#8220;came from Galilee to the Jordan&#8221; to be baptized by John (3:13). Galilee, a despised region, signifies rejection. Jordan signifies termination and germination. The wonderful church life sooner or later will terminate us all. It is in this place of termination that we meet the King. Likewise, the Lord&#8217;s baptism enabled Him through death and resurrection to minister not in a natural way but in the way of resurrection.</p><p>In Matthew 4 the heavenly King was tested by the devil. But the Lord Jesus overcame every aspect of the enemy&#8217;s temptation. He could say, &#8220;My living is secondary. I don&#8217;t care for religious power. And worldly glory has nothing to do with Me. I know only God&#8217;s word and God Himself. I care only to serve God.&#8221; Therefore, as the One who passed the test, the Lord Jesus was qualified to be the King of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 3 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 4:12, 16-22</h2><p>12 &nbsp;Now when He heard that John was delivered up, He <sup>1</sup>withdrew into Galilee.</p><p class="bold">16 &nbsp;The people sitting in darkness have seen a <sup>1</sup>great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, to them light has risen.&#8221;</p><p>17 &nbsp;From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.</p><p>18 &nbsp;And while He was walking beside the <sup>1</sup>Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, <sup>2</sup>casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</p><p class="bold">19 &nbsp;And He said to them, Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.</p><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;And immediately leaving the nets, they <sup>1</sup>followed Him.</p><p class="bold">21 &nbsp;And going on from there, He saw another two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, <sup>1</sup>mending their nets; and He called them.</p><p class="bold">22 &nbsp;And immediately leaving the boat and their father, they followed Him.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>12<sup>1</sup> John the Baptist ministered in the wilderness, not in the holy temple in the holy city; still, his ministry was in Judea, not far from the &#8220;holy&#8221; things.

This occurred sovereignly to fulfill the prophecy in Isa. 9:1-2.</p><p>16<sup>1</sup> The new King&#8217;s ministry for the kingdom of the heavens began not with earthly power but with heavenly light, which was the King Himself as the light of life shining in the shadow of death.</p><p>18<sup>1</sup> The new King&#8217;s ministry was not in the capital but beside the sea. His forerunner&#8217;s ministry began by the riverside and consisted of burying the religious and terminating their religion. The new King&#8217;s ministry began by the seashore and consisted of catching men who were not very religious, men who lived around the sea instead of in the holy place, and making them fishers of men for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>18<sup>2</sup> When Peter and Andrew were called by the Lord, they were casting a net into the sea.

Eventually, not only the believing Jews but also the discipled nations (the Gentiles-28:19) became His disciples. Later the disciples were called Christians (Acts 11:26). Hence, the word the new King spoke on the mountain in chs. 5-7, concerning the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, was spoken to the believers of the New Testament, not to the Jews of the Old Testament.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Matthew 5, 6, and 7 may be called the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens....In these three chapters,...we see a revelation of the spiritual living and heavenly principles of the kingdom of the heavens. The nature is singular, but the principles are plural. The constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is composed of seven sections: the nature of the kingdom people (5:1-12); the influence of the kingdom people upon the world (5:13-16); the law of the kingdom people (5:17-48); the righteous deeds of the kingdom people (6:1-18); the dealing of the kingdom people with riches (6:19-34); the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others (7:1-12); and the ground of the kingdom people&#8217;s living and work (7:13-29). The first section, 5:3-12, depicts the nature of the kingdom of the heavens under nine blessings. It unfolds the kind of people who live in the kingdom of the heavens. The kingdom people must also exert an influence upon the world. The nature of the kingdom people, the very nature of the kingdom, exercises an influence upon the world. The kingdom people also have a law. This law is not the old law, the law of Moses, the ten commandments; it is the new law of the kingdom of the heavens. The kingdom people are those who perform righteous deeds and who have the proper attitude concerning material riches. Because the kingdom people are still on earth in human society, the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens reveals principles by which they deal with others. Finally, in the last section of this constitution we see the ground, the base, of the daily life and work of the kingdom people.</p><p>All Christians should be kingdom people. However, the situation today is not normal. Many believers are not on the high level of the kingdom people. The kingdom people are the overcomers. In God&#8217;s economy, every believer should be an overcomer. To be an overcomer is not to be something special; it is to be normal.</p><p>These verses [5:3-12] describe nine aspects of the nature of the kingdom people. They are poor in spirit, mourning for the present situation, meek in suffering opposition, hungry and thirsty for righteousness, merciful toward others, pure in heart, making peace with all men, suffering persecution for righteousness, and suffering being reproached and evil spoken of. Every aspect begins with the word, &#8220;Blessed.&#8221;...The English word &#8220;blessed&#8221; does not adequately translate the Greek word here, for the Greek word conveys the meanings of both blessed and happy.... However, we should not use the word happy in a loose way. The blessedness and the happiness here is not a light thing; it is something that is rather weighty.

The kingdom of God is God&#8217;s general reign from eternity past to eternity future. It comprises eternity without beginning before the foundation of the world, the chosen patriarchs (including the paradise of Adam), the nation of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament, the coming millennial kingdom (including its heavenly part, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, and its earthly part, the Messianic kingdom), and the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem in eternity without end. The kingdom of the heavens is a specific section within the kingdom of God, a section composed only of the church today and the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom. Hence, in the New Testament, especially in the other three Gospels, the kingdom of the heavens, a section of the kingdom of God, is also called &#8220;the kingdom of God.&#8221;</p><p>According to Matthew there are three aspects concerning the kingdom of the heavens: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward content of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature, as revealed by the new King on the mountain in chs. 5-7. The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward state of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed by the King on the seashore in ch. 13. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power, as unveiled by the King on the Mount of Olives in chs. 24-25. Both the reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church today. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the proper church life (Rom. 14:17), which exists in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, known as Christendom. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom, which is referred to as the kingdom of the Father in 13:43; the earthly part of the millennial kingdom is the Messianic kingdom, which is referred to as the kingdom of the Son of Man in 13:41, and which is the restored tabernacle of David, the kingdom of David (Acts 15:16). In the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom, which is the kingdom of the heavens manifested in power, the overcoming believers will reign with Christ for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6); in the earthly part of the millennial kingdom, which is the Messianic kingdom on earth, the saved remnant of Israel will be the priests and will teach the nations to worship God (Zech. 8:20-23).</p><p>If we are poor in spirit, the kingdom of the heavens is ours: we are in its reality now in the church age, and we will share in its manifestation in the kingdom age.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>We all need to...[pray], &#8220;Lord, unload me.

This is for the kingdom of the heavens. Our spirit is the organ by which we receive Christ (John 1:12; 3:6), whereas our heart is the ground where Christ as the seed of life grows (13:19). For the kingdom of the heavens we need to be poor in spirit, empty in our spirit, that we may receive Christ.

In this way we will express His life and nature and be called the sons of God.</p><p>10<sup>1</sup> The whole world lies in the evil one (1 John 5:19) and is filled with unrighteousness. If we hunger and thirst for righteousness, we will be persecuted for the sake of righteousness. For the sake of the kingdom of the heavens, we need to pay a price for the righteousness that we seek.</p><p>10<sup>2</sup> If we seek for righteousness at a cost, the kingdom of the heavens becomes ours: we are in its reality now, and we will be rewarded with its manifestation in the coming age.</p><p>11<sup>1</sup> When we live a life for the kingdom of the heavens, in the spiritual nature of the kingdom and according to the heavenly principles of the kingdom, we are reproached, persecuted, and evilly spoken of, mostly by the religious people, who hold to their traditional religious concepts.

Rather, it is the outflow of our inner being, the expression of what we are within.</p><p>The sequence of these verses is very significant. Firstly, we must be poor in spirit, and then we can mourn. If we are not poor in our spirit, we do not have the capacity for the King to come in to establish His kingdom within our being. [Thus,] we cannot realize how negative and pitiful the whole world is....For this reason, the Lord Jesus did not speak first of mourning and then of being poor in spirit. He put the matter of being poor in our spirit first.</p><p>If you have been fully occupied within by the heavenly kingdom, you will mourn...and be meek...toward every pitiful person....The New Testament tells us that we do not fight against flesh and blood, but against the devil, against the enemy of God.

No, we must hunger and thirst for the highest righteousness.</p><p>Although we must be strict with ourselves in righteousness, we must learn to be merciful to others and not to place demands on them....When others offend us, thereby exposing their shortage, we must be merciful toward them.

To be political is falsehood and hypocrisy. We must be righteously square, not politically round. Remember, the New Jerusalem is square.</p><p>The eighth blessing concerns the persecution for righteousness (v. 10)....If we would have the kingdom of the heavens remain in us, we must stay in righteousness. But...be prepared to confront persecution.</p><p>[The ninth blessing concerns being reproached for the sake of Christ.] The entire world, whether it is the political, religious, educational, commercial, or industrial world, is against Christ. Therefore, if you live by Christ, for Christ, and with Christ, you will surely be reproached and evil spoken of.</p><p>Each of the nine blessings has a reward.

In His economy God intended to have a thorough change from the old economy to the new. John the Baptist ministered by the riverside, in the wilderness, because he was prepared to bury everyone who came to him in repentance. The newly appointed King began His kingly ministry by the Sea of Galilee, a despised place, far from Jerusalem with its sacred temple, the center of the orthodox religion.</p><p>Peter, Andrew, James, and John were called by the Lord Jesus as a great shining light. They were attracted not by what the Lord Jesus did, but by what He was. No one who follows the Lord because of what He does can be trustworthy or faithful. The trustworthy ones are those who are caught by what the Lord is.</p><p>The Gospel of Matthew, the book on the kingdom of the heavens, has a constitution that is revealed in chapters 5, 6, and 7. The constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is composed of seven sections: 1) the nature of the kingdom people (5:1-12); 2) the influence of the kingdom people upon the world (5:13-16); 3) the law of the kingdom people (5:17-48); 4) the righteous deeds of the kingdom people (6:1-18); 5) the dealing of the kingdom people with riches (6:19-34); 6) the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others (7:1-12); and 7) the ground of the kingdom people&#8217;s living and work (7:13-29).</p><p>The kingdom of the heavens is a specific term used by Matthew, indicating that the kingdom of the heavens differs from the kingdom of God, the term used in the other three Gospels. The kingdom of God refers to God&#8217;s reign in a general way from eternity past to eternity future. The kingdom of the heavens is a special section within the kingdom of God, composed only of the church today and the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom.</p><p>According to Matthew, there are three aspects concerning the kingdom of the heavens: the reality (chs. 5-7), the appearance (ch. 13), and the manifestation (chs. 23-24). Specifically, the reality is the inward contents in its heavenly and spiritual nature; the appearance is the outward state in name; and the manifestation is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power.</p><p>The first section of the constitution (5:1-12) reveals the nature of the kingdom people. The kingdom people are the overcomers. To be an overcomer is not something special; it is to be normal. These verses describe nine aspects of the nature of the kingdom people. They are poor in spirit, mourning for the present situation, meek in suffering opposition, hungry and thirsty for righteousness, merciful toward others, pure in heart, making peace with all men, suffering persecution for righteousness, and suffering being reproached and evil spoken of. The kingdom of the heavens is firstly related to our spirit (v. 3). We must see that for the kingdom of the heavens we must be poor in spirit, fully emptied in our spirit, that we may receive Christ. Also, we need to be pure in heart (v. 8), single in purpose that Christ may grow in us without hindrance or frustration. If we have Christ, we have the kingdom of the heavens. If we live Christ, then the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is ours. Thus, the real blessing is Christ with His kingdom.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 4 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 5:13-16</h2><p class="bold">13 &nbsp;You are the <sup>1</sup>salt of the earth.

As a city on a mountain, the light cannot be hidden, and as the lamp on the lampstand, the light should not be hidden.</p><p>16<sup>1</sup> To glorify God the Father is to give Him the glory.

Christ&#8217;s keeping of the law qualified Him to fulfill the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross. Christ&#8217;s fulfilling of the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross brought in the resurrection life to complement the law, to fill the law to the full. The old law, the lower law, with the demand that it be kept and the requirement that man be punished, is over. The kingdom people, as the children of the Father, now need to fulfill only the new law, the higher law, by the resurrection life, which is the eternal life of the Father. The old law was given through Moses, whereas the new law was decreed by Christ personally.</p><p>Concerning the law there are two aspects: the commandments of the law and the principle of the law. The commandments of the law were fulfilled and complemented by the Lord&#8217;s coming, whereas the principle of the law was replaced by the principle of faith according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy.</p><p>18<sup>1</sup> After the millennial kingdom the old heaven and old earth will pass away when the new heaven and new earth come in (Rev. 21:1; Heb. 1:11-12; 2 Pet. 3:10-13). What is covered by the law extends only to the end of the millennial kingdom, whereas what is covered by the prophets extends to the new heaven and new earth (Isa. 65:17; 66:22). This is why both the law and the prophets are referred to in v. 17, but only the law, not the prophets, is mentioned in v. 18.</p><p>19<sup>1</sup> Commandments here refers to the law in v. 18.

Why then was there still the need for the law of the kingdom of the heavens? The reason is that the demands of the old law were not high enough. The requirements of the old law were not complete. Take the example of murder. The old law commanded us not to murder (Exo. 20:13), but it did not say a word about anger.... Here we see the shortage, the incompleteness, of the old law....According to the law of the kingdom of the heavens, we are forbidden to be angry with our brothers [vv. 21-22]. Thus, the basic principle of the [new] law...is that it is higher than the old law. We do not annul the old law; we complement it to make it higher.</p><p>[Christ&#8217;s] resurrection life is much higher than the natural life, for it is actually the divine life, the eternal life, the life on the highest plane.

This subjective righteousness is obtained...by the complementing of the old law through the fulfilling of the new law of the kingdom of the heavens given...here in this section of the Word. This righteousness of the kingdom people, which is according to the new law of the kingdom, surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, which is according to the old law. It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by a higher life, the resurrection life of Christ. This righteousness, which is likened to the wedding garment (22:11-12), qualifies us to participate in the wedding of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-8) and inherit the kingdom of the heavens in its manifestation, that is, to enter into the kingdom of the heavens in the future.</p><p>The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees is the righteousness of letters, which they practiced by their own life according to the old law of letters; the surpassing righteousness of the kingdom people is the righteousness of life, which they live out by taking Christ as their life according to the new law of life.</p><p>20<sup>2</sup> Entrance into the kingdom of God requires regeneration as a new beginning of our life (John 3:3, 5), but entrance into the kingdom of the heavens demands surpassing righteousness in our living after regeneration.

The first is...at the gate of the city....The second is...by the Sanhedrin,...a higher judgment. The third is the judgment by God through the Gehenna [see note 228 in RcV] of fire, which is the highest judgment. These three kinds of judgments were mentioned here by the new King, who used figures from the Jewish background because His entire audience was Jewish. However, in regard to the kingdom people, the believers of the New Testament, all these judgments refer to the judgment of the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ, as revealed in 2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10, 12; 1 Cor. 4:4-5; 3:13-15; Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; and Heb. 10:27, 30. This clearly reveals that the New Testament believers, although forgiven by God forever, are still liable to the Lord&#8217;s judgment, a judgment not for perdition but for discipline, if they sin against the new law of the kingdom as given here. However, when we sin against the new law of the kingdom, we will be forgiven and cleansed by the blood of the Lord Jesus if we repent and confess our sins (1 John 1:7, 9).</p><p>22<sup>3</sup> I.e., stupid, good-for-nothing.

[This] law...was ordained because of the people&#8217;s hardness of heart; it was not according to God&#8217;s design in the beginning (19:7-8).

[Verses 38-42 reveal that] the old law did not touch people&#8217;s anger or their heart. But the new law, the changed law, touches both our temper and our heart.</p><p>[The last law changed by the Lord is regarding enemies.] Legally speaking, the old law [v. 43] is fair and righteous; for a good neighbor deserves our love and an enemy deserves our hatred.

Their influence issues from their nature. In verse 13 the Lord said, &#8220;You are the salt of the earth,&#8221; and in verse 14 He said, &#8220;You are the light of the world.&#8221; The &#8220;you&#8221; in these two verses does not refer to an individual, but to a corporate people. The kingdom people as the salt kill the germs of corruption and preserve the God-created earth. Moreover, as a city on a mountain, they are the light effacing the world&#8217;s darkness, and as a lamp uncovered, they shine to all who are in the house.</p><p>The third section of the King&#8217;s word on the mountain (5:17-48) concerns the law of the kingdom people. There are three aspects of the law: 1) the principle, 2) the commandments, and 3) the rituals. The principle of the law was replaced in the dispensation of grace with the principle of faith. Likewise, the rituals-offering sacrifices and keeping the Sabbath-were also terminated because they were part of the old dispensation of shadows, figures, and types, all of which have been fulfilled by Christ as the reality. Concerning the commandments of the law, they were uplifted, complemented, and completed by the Lord&#8217;s coming (v. 17).</p><p>Our entrance into the kingdom of God requires regeneration (John 3:3, 5), but entrance into the kingdom of the heavens demands surpassing righteousness (Matt. 5:20) in our living after regeneration. Such righteousness can only be produced by the higher, resurrection life of Christ.</p><p>In Matthew 5:22 we have the judgment of the believers. This thought of being burned by fire is found in both 1 Corinthians 3 and Hebrews 6. Revelation 2:11 implies that the defeated Christians will be hurt by the second death, the lake of fire. Although believers are forgiven by God forever, they are still liable to the Lord&#8217;s judgment, not for perdition but for discipline, if they sin against the new law of the kingdom as given here. However, if we sin, we will be forgiven and cleansed by the blood of the Lord Jesus if we repent and confess our sins (1 John 1:7, 9).</p><p>Two crucial matters are seen in Matthew 5:23-26. First, with our brother, if, as we come to contact the Lord, we have the sense that a brother or sister has a complaint against us, we must stop our fellowship with the Lord and go to this one and be reconciled. Then we may come back to continue our fellowship with the Lord. Second, with our opponent, we should be reconciled to our opponent before we die, before he dies, or before the Lord comes back. If we do not take care of any matter now, we shall have to deal with it in the coming age.</p><p>In verses 27 through 30, the Lord spoke about murder and adultery. Murder refers to our temper, and adultery to our lust. In order to live up to the high standard of the new law, we need another life. We must contact Christ daily, hourly, and moment by moment. As Romans 8:13 reveals, by the Spirit we must &#8220;put to death the practices of the body,&#8221; and, as Colossians 3:5 says, we must mortify our &#8220;members which are on the earth.&#8221;</p><p>Finally, in verses 31 through 48, the four laws regarding divorce, swearing, resisting evil, and loving our enemies have all been changed. All these laws touch our being and put us on the cross. Only by living Christ who is the resurrection life within our spirit will the righteous requirement of the law be fulfilled in us.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 5 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 6:1-4, 6</h2><p class="bold">1 &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>But take care not to do your <sup>2</sup>righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward....</p><p>2 &nbsp;Therefore when you give alms, do not <sup>1</sup>sound a trumpet before you as the <sup>2</sup>hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men....</p><p class="bold">3 &nbsp;But you, when you give alms, do not let your <sup>1</sup>left hand know what your right hand is doing,</p><p class="bold">4 &nbsp;So that your alms may be in <sup>1</sup>secret; and your Father who <sup>2</sup>sees in secret will repay you.</p><p class="bold">6 &nbsp;But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret...</p> <h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>1<sup>1</sup> The fourth section of the King&#8217;s decree on the mountain, vv. 1-18, concerns the righteous deeds of the kingdom people.</p><p>1<sup>2</sup> Righteousness here denotes righteous deeds, such as giving alms (vv. 2-4), praying (vv. 5-15), and fasting (vv. 16-18).</p><p>2<sup>1</sup> Surely the heaven-ruled spirit of the kingdom people restricts them from such fleshly boasting.</p><p>2<sup>2</sup> A stage actor, an impersonator.

In the Acts and the Epistles there is no example of such reciting.</p><p>9<sup>2</sup> In the example of prayer given as a pattern by the Lord, the first three petitions imply the Trinity of the Godhead: &#8220;Your name be sanctified&#8221; is related mainly to the Father; &#8220;Your kingdom come,&#8221; to the Son; and &#8220;Your will be done,&#8221; to the Spirit. This is being fulfilled in this age, and it will be ultimately fulfilled in the coming kingdom age, when the name of God will be excellent in all the earth (Psa. 8:1), the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ (Rev. 11:15), and the will of God will be accomplished.</p><p>10<sup>1</sup> After the rebellion of Satan (Ezek. 28:17; Isa. 14:13-15), the earth fell into his usurping hand. Thus, the will of God could not be done on earth as in heaven. Hence, God created man with the intention of recovering the earth for Himself (Gen. 1:26-28). After the fall of man, Christ came to bring the heavenly rule to earth so that the earth could be recovered for God&#8217;s interest, so that the will of God could be done on earth as in heaven. This is why the new King established the kingdom of the heavens with His followers. The kingdom people must pray for this until the earth is fully recovered for God&#8217;s will in the coming kingdom age.</p><p>11<sup>1</sup> This prayer, as a pattern, cares first for God&#8217;s name, God&#8217;s kingdom, and God&#8217;s will, and second, for our need.</p><p>11<sup>2</sup> Or, bread until tomorrow, bread for this day. Daily bread indicates a living that is by faith. The kingdom people should not live on what they have stored; rather, they should live, by faith, on the Father&#8217;s daily supply.</p><p>12<sup>1</sup> This prayer, as a pattern, cares, third, for the kingdom people&#8217;s failures before God and for their relationship with others. The kingdom people should ask the Father to forgive their debts, their failures, their trespasses, as they forgive their debtors to maintain peace.</p><p>13<sup>1</sup> Or, evil. This prayer, as a pattern, cares, fourth, for the kingdom people&#8217;s deliverance from the evil one and from evil things. The kingdom people should ask the Father not to bring them into temptation but to deliver them from the evil one, the devil, and from the evil that is out of him.</p><p>16<sup>1</sup> To fast is not to refrain from eating; it is to be unable to eat because of a desperate burden to pray for certain things. It is also an expression of self-humbling in seeking God&#8217;s mercy. To give alms is to give what we have the right to possess, whereas to fast is to give up what we have the right to enjoy.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In verses 9 through 13 we find the pattern of prayer; however,...not...for all prayers....In John chapters fourteen through seventeen...the prayer...is related to life....

But whether or not they received the harvest depended upon God. Their responsibility was to labor without having any anxiety.

However, this man was not productive for the sake of anxiety, but for the sake of fulfilling his duty.

This is to enter in through the narrow gate and walk the constricted way that leads to life.</p><p>25<sup>1</sup> The rain, which descends from the heavens, is of God; the rivers, which come from the earth, are of man; and the winds, which blow from the air, are of Satan. All these will test the living and work of the kingdom people.</p><p>25<sup>2</sup> The house built on the rock, a house that does not fall, is like the work that is built with gold, silver, and precious stones, a work that can stand the testing fire (1 Cor. 3:12-13).</p><p>26<sup>1</sup> Sand refers to human concepts and natural ways. If we live and work according to our human concepts and natural ways, our living and work will be founded on sinking sand. This is to enter in through the wide gate and walk the broad way that leads to destruction.</p><p>27<sup>1</sup> The house built on sand...falls, [and] is like the work that is built with wood, hay, and stubble, a work that will be burned by the testing fire...(1 Cor. 3:12-15).</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 302-308; Hymns: #947</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 5 - PROPHECY</p><h2 class="uhead1">Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="3"><li>The King&#8217;s ministry (4:12-11:30)	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="2">	<li>The decree of the kingdom&#8217;s constitution (5:1-7:29)		<ol class="decimal" start="4">		<li>Concerning the righteous deeds of the kingdom people (6:1-18)</li>		<li>Concerning the material riches of the kingdom people-6:19-34</li>		<li>Concerning the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others (7:1-12)</li>		<li>Concerning the ground of the kingdom people&#8217;s living and work (7:13-29)</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class="uhead1">Crucial Points</h2><p>The fourth section of the King&#8217;s decree on the mountain, Matthew 6:1-18, concerns the righteous deeds of the kingdom people. Here the Lord uses three illustrations-the giving of alms, praying, and fasting-to reveal how we are filled with the self and the flesh. We must do our righteous deeds in secret, for our Father is in secret. We all need some secret growth in life, some secret experiences of Christ. Following this, we find the pattern of prayer (vv. 9-13). However, it is not the pattern for all prayers. The prayer in John 14-17 is related to life, whereas the prayer in Matthew 6 is a prayer of warfare against God&#8217;s enemy for God&#8217;s kingdom.</p><p>The fifth section of the King&#8217;s decree (vv. 19-34) concerns the riches of the kingdom people. Actually, the Lord is dealing with the underlying matter of anxiety. In ancient times, the children of Israel had to labor by tilling the ground, sowing the seed, watering, and harvesting. This was their duty. But whether or not they received the harvest depended on God. Their responsibility was to labor without having any anxiety. Likewise, we must fulfill our duty, our responsibility, but not for the sake of our anxiety. Our duty is to give, to lay up treasures in heaven.</p><p>The sixth section of the new King&#8217;s decree on the mountain (7:1-12) concerns the principles of the kingdom people in their dealings with others. Actually, His intention here is to encourage us to forget ourselves and to take care of others. If we take care of others, we will not judge them, criticize them, measure them, nor impose requirements on them. To help them we must be blind, considerate, sympathizing, and full of mercy.</p><p>The seventh and last section of the King&#8217;s decree (vv. 13-29) concerns the ground of the kingdom people&#8217;s living and work. In this section, there are four crucial words that reveal the consummation of the kingdom&#8217;s constitution: gate, way, will, and house. No one can fulfill the requirements of this constitution unless he has been regenerated and possesses the life and nature of the heavenly Father. To enter in through the gate is simply to begin walking on the way, a way that is lifelong. Our way is full of limitations, restrictions, and constrictions. But the limitations are not a frustration; rather, they will speed us on our way. Remember two things are needed for our entrance into the kingdom of the heavens: to call on the Lord and to do the will of the heavenly Father. Through calling on the Lord, we have been regenerated with the divine life, whereas our doing the will of the Father is to live that life.</p><p>Finally, the kingdom&#8217;s people living and work must be founded on the word of the new King. Hearing His words and doing them, we are likened to a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock. The house built upon the rock will not fall because it is built according to the constricted way, the way of doing the will of the Father. However, to build with our opinions, human concepts, and natural ways is to build upon sinking sand. When tested, this house will fall. This is to build with wood, grass, and stubble, a work that will be burned by the testing fire (1 Cor. 3). This is the Lord&#8217;s conclusion of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p></body></html>
