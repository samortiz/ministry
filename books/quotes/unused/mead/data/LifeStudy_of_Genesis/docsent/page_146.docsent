   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Process a. Man's Presumption</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in Offering "the Fruit of the Ground" to God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Cain was presumptuous and served God according to his own concept.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord" Gen 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Cain served God according to his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He invented a religion of man's concept.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is not a word in Genesis 3 about offering the fruit of the ground to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God cares for a sacrifice in which the blood is shed to meet the requirement of God's righteousness and He cares for the skins of the sacrificial lambs that can cover fallen, naked persons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Adam and Eve discovered that they were naked, they covered themselves with skirts made of fig leaves, but God had no regard for that kind of covering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God slew some lambs for sin offerings and from the skins of those lambs He made robes to cover the man and the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have seen that Adam and Eve must have told Cain and Abel about this and that Abel received their word and acted on it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, Cain considered himself more clever and disregarded God's concern, refusing to take His way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not obey God's gospel, but invented his own way, a religion according to his own concept.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who told him to offer of the fruit of the ground?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He told himself, being motivated by the subtle one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This practice originated with his own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Throughout the centuries and the generations there have been countless followers of Cain, people in every place and time who have invented their own religion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They did not teach people to sin, but to serve God and worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In their presumption these people think that they are serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They say, "What is wrong with serving God in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are not gambling, stealing, or killing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are serving God."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, I would say to them, "You serve God according to your concept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ultimately, you do not serve God, you serve yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You serve your own concept and you do not care for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is not your God; your concept, your mentality, is your God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you read Genesis 4 hastily, you may have the same problem that I had when I read this portion of the Word as a young man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I said, "God is not fair.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both brothers presented an offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What was wrong with Cain's offering?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He wasn't gambling or stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was religious.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he had not been religious, he wouldn't have presented an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He labored on the ground until it produced fruit and then he preserved some of that fruit as an offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Wasn't that good?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How could God condemn him for doing that?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the Bible says, "But upon Cain and on his offering He did not look" Gen 4:5, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God seemed to say to Cain, "Cain, you did something religious, but I will not even look at it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not a service to Me. You are serving your own concept.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I don't care at all for your offering."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I was young I could not understand why God reacted in this way, respecting Abel's offering and rejecting Cain's. I thought that God was unfair.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the years went by I came to realize that although Cain presented an offering to God, he did not present it according to God's way, but according to his own idea.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Out of his own concept and desire he invented a new way of worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In today's Christianity there are many new inventions for worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All such inventions are presumptuous.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to his natural being, Cain was no longer pure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although Adam was pure when created by God, as a result of the fall Satan, the evil one, injected himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, whenever man acts by himself he is in union with the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, man should not act on his own, but should reject himself and depend on God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I must continually realize that I am a fallen person and that Satan is within me, in my nature, in my thought, desire, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Satan is altogether one with me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I dare not exercise myself in acting on my own.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I must say, "Lord, I cast myself aside and I put my trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lord, You take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You take the initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Lord, I want to follow You and take Your way."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are not merely sinful, but our very self has become devilish because Satan is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Everything we devise according to our nature is actually an invention of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Cain, along with numerous people today, did not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He thought that as long as he did something for God, serving Him and worshipping Him, everything was fine.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You must realize where you stand and what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As fallen people, we are one with the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is not only around us and over us, but also within us, in our nature, in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whenever you lose your temper Satan is present.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whenever you exercise your emotions by yourself, Satan is active in you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not say that it is only you who behave in such a way, for Satan is with you and in you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not only true in evil things, but even in good things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When Cain presented the fruit of the ground as an offering to God, Satan was involved in his activity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Cain Satan presented an offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>That was the reason that God refused to look at it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God seemed to say, "Cain, your offering is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is an insult to Me. It is an abomination in My eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I refuse to accept it."</S>
