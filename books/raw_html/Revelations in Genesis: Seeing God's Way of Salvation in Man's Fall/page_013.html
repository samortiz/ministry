        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FIRST FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to consider God&rsquo;s way of salvation to deal with man&rsquo;s first fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUBDUING MAN WITH SUFFERING</h2>
<p>God dealt with man&rsquo;s first fall by seeking man, by judging the serpent, and by giving a promise to man. He also dealt with man&rsquo;s fall by subduing man through suffering. After judging the serpent and giving a promise in His word of judgment, God said to the woman, &ldquo;I will greatly multiply / Your pain in your childbearing; / In pain you will bring forth children&rdquo; (Gen. 3:16). God&rsquo;s judgment on the woman did not include death or destruction; it involved pain, suffering. This word is still being fulfilled in mankind. Women go through a painful process in childbearing, including pregnancy, delivery, and raising children. This process was arranged by God. However, women also are saved through childbearing, &ldquo;if they remain in faith and love and holiness with sobriety&rdquo; (1 Tim. 2:15).</p>
<p>God had another special arrangement for the woman: &ldquo;Your desire will be to your husband, / And he will rule over you&rdquo; (Gen. 3:16). This means that, on one hand, the woman must focus her heart on her husband, and on the other hand, she must be under the rule of her husband. With her heart attached to her husband and her person ruled by her husband, a woman is limited in other inclinations and cannot readily assume the headship, thus saving her from much trouble. If a woman is willing to accept God&rsquo;s arrangement to whole-heartedly love her husband and absolutely submit to the authority of her husband, this arrangement will become a salvation and protection (1 Tim. 2:11-12).</p>
<p>God gave the man a different kind of suffering. A man must toil all the days of his life; that is, by the sweat of his face will he eat bread (Gen. 3:17-19). Before the fall it was easy to work the ground, but after the fall it was no longer easy to work the ground, because it gave forth thorns and thistles. Although most of us are not farmers, we still need to toil, labor, and sweat until we return to the ground. Returning to the ground is the consequence of sin in man&rsquo;s body. Hence, God uses suffering to deal with both the man and the woman.</p>
<p>No one thinks that suffering is good, and no one wants to suffer. Although suffering is not a good thing, it is appointed by God, just as medication is prescribed by a doctor for his patients, even though it may be bitter. God&rsquo;s intention in assigning sufferings to us is to subdue us and save us. After the fall it is good to have sufferings because it is dangerous to be at ease. A person who is at ease commits more sins. If a person works hard every day, he will have no time to sin. The more a person suffers, the less he commits sins, but the more a person is at ease, the more he commits sins.</p>
<p>There are three things that are both good and bad for man: suffering, sleep, and death. No matter how bad a person is, it is unlikely that he will be bad for one hundred and twenty years, for he may die by the age of eighty. Man has this &ldquo;greater&rdquo; death and also a &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; death, which is sleep. If fallen mankind lived an easy life without sleeping or dying, eventually the people in the world would all be old and crafty. No matter how evil a person is, he cannot escape death. There are many evil people in the world today, but we do not fear their evil, because one day they will die. Committing evil shortens a person&rsquo;s life. The more a person commits sin and does evil, the sooner he will die. Those who sin more will die sooner.</p>
<p>It is good that man must die. It would be terrible if there were no death. Suffering, sleep, and death are God&rsquo;s protection. Without death this world would be much more corrupt. The same can be said about suffering. A man who labors and toils to take care of his family and to fulfill his duties at work and does not wander around will avoid many opportunities to sin. If he lives an easy life, however, he will commit many sins and do many evil things. He also needs to stop and sleep every day. Those who like to play mah-jongg are the least willing to sleep. Eventually, however, everyone has to sleep due to fatigue. Sleep reduces the time for playing mah-jongg. The world today is full of evil things. Without suffering, sleep, and death, it is difficult to say what this generation would become. Suffering is a remedy, protection, and salvation.</p>
<p>After World War II many women in Europe and America have not wanted to have children, because they want to enjoy an easier life. This is an offense to God. Women who do not want to have children tend to live dissolutely. One of the best ways to deal with a dissolute woman is for her to have three children; then she will become sober. There was once a woman who was so dissolute that her parents and teachers did not know what to do with her; eventually, however, she was subdued by her two children.</p>
<p>We should not think that God&rsquo;s arrangement is wrong. It is God&rsquo;s arrangement for women to raise a family and for men to sweat in making a living. This arrangement enables human beings to maintain a normal living and prevents fallen people from becoming worse. If suffering does not subdue someone, God will make him sleep. This is as if God were saying, &ldquo;Take a break! You have sinned enough.&rdquo; If this &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; death cannot subdue him, he will still die one day. No matter how much evil a person commits, he will eventually die. This is what it means to be subdued through suffering. Because of suffering, sleep, and death, there is a continuing human history. Without suffering, sleep, and death, fallen mankind would be out of control. Subduing man through suffering is the way to deal with man&rsquo;s fall in order to save and preserve man. God does not intend to destroy man; rather, He wants to preserve man, and He wants to redeem man.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
