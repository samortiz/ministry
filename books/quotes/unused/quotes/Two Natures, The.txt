Sometimes, their spiritual condition seems to be on the mountaintop; at other times, it seems to be in the deep valley
Why do we sometimes love a certain person that much and have the ability to tolerate so much of others' ridicule?
Formerly, these things would have been considered trivial, and the conscience would not have been bothered at all
Only after he finds out that the Lord has fully forgiven his sins and he has recovered his spiritual joy can he feel happy again
Those believers who remain on this level of life soon find themselves caused to stumble again and their previous joy once more lost!
They set up for themselves many ordinances to bind themselves, in the hope that they will not commit the same error again
At the same time, they ask for the cleansing of the Lord's blood afresh and seek for another filling of the Holy Spirit by the Lord
After this, they seem quite satisfied and think that their last sin is behind them, that from now on they are on their way to holiness
Once more they fall into deep remorse, bemoaning their own failure and feeling sorrowful at heart; their hopes for holiness have been dashed
After a believer realizes that his besetting sin is his quick temper, he will try to control himself in everything
Though he may hold back his temper temporarily, further irritations from others will cause his temper to break loose
A genuinely regenerated person often goes through this kind of experience at the beginning of his Christian life
Before we speak of our present condition, we should first understand the kind of person we were before we believed in the Lord
After understanding the origin of the flesh and how the flesh is just our sinful nature, we can now consider the character of this flesh
No matter how much a person tries to perform charitable, benevolent acts, send relief aid, love others, or serve, he is still the flesh
Since God saw that it was impossible to mend, improve, or change man's sinful nature, He brought in the present wonderful way of redemption
After we have believed in the Lord Jesus, God does not leave us to walk according to the old sinful nature, that is, the flesh
Through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust'
Rather, it is the work of God's Holy Spirit in our spirit, recovering our spirit's lost position and installing God's life in our spirit
The reason you fluctuate up and down and alternate between victory and defeat is that two natures are exercising their influence over you
For a young believer to have such experiences of inward conflict and condemnation proves that he is regenerated
Without the new nature, it is obvious that a person will not experience the conflict between the new nature and the old
In the same way, while the Son of God lives in our heart as our new life, all the lusts in our flesh strive to remove Him
Without comparison with the new nature, the old nature, humanly speaking, is not too bad, despite some self-excusing inclinations and lusts
When both the new and the old natures are put side by side, the true characteristics of the old nature are exposed
Since man's flesh and sinful nature have become too strong, the growth and function of the new nature are suppressed
Because the two natures are opposite one to another, when temptation comes, a person experiences fierce conflicts
Since the new nature is holy, when a person fails, he feels repentant and condemns himself, and he pleads for the sin-cleansing blood
These three verses tell us two ways to overcome the flesh, that is, the sinful nature, the old nature, and the old Adamic nature
We have seen that all our failures are caused by the tenaciousness of the sinful nature; we sink to such a low condition because of it
Whether or not we will overcome depends on whether or not we are able to deal with this sinful nature, which is the flesh
When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, not only did He die for us, but He crucified our flesh with Him on the cross
Now, in the same way, we believe that our flesh is crucified with Him, and we are brought into the experience of the death of the flesh
Until we are delivered from this body of sin, we will never be free from the 'flesh' the sinful nature which comes from the body of sin
Even though we have accepted the work of the cross, the fact that the flesh still exists means that we must continually 'walk by the Spirit'
On the negative side, we should believe in the co-crucifixion of the cross for the elimination of a life in the flesh
On the positive side, we should walk according to the Spirit so that the flesh will have no chance to be rekindled
A person can read about this way of overcoming the flesh, the sinful nature, from the Bible; he can hear about it from others
Although we say that we trust in the cross, thirty percent of the time we trust in ourselves and in our own 'reckoning'
Many times God allows us to be defeated so that in the end we would realize that nothing is trustworthy in our experience
Now, you should ask the Holy Spirit to strengthen your will, so that it will be able to incline itself to the new nature
After the Holy Spirit has strengthened you, you should exercise this will to walk according to the Holy Spirit
