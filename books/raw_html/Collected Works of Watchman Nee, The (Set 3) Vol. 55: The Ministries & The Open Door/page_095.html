<p>The boat arrived in Xiaoshan around 5:00 in the morning. We walked to the train station and saw many passengers sleeping there. We walked into the station and lined up at the ticket window. Soon the sleeping people woke up and were fighting for places in line after us; more and more people came to buy tickets, and the place was soon very crowded. When the time for ticket sales came, we saw a notice on the ticket window, saying, "Only ten tickets will be sold for today's train, half for soldiers and half for citizens." Oh! That was just the number we needed, not too many or too few. We heard many of the people behind us berating themselves for not being watchful, having spent the night in vain. We could only prostrate ourselves and worship the Lord in our spirit!</p><p>We arrived safely at the Yiyang Train Station on the second morning. We walked for fifteen miles from the station to the Yangshuchiao Faith Cooperative Farm. (Brother Fan bought the land and cultivated it in 1942.) As we walked, we noticed that there are hills and mountains everywhere: the countryside is not flat like that of Chekiang. Villages are scattered among mountain ridges, and it is difficult to know where towns are unless one sees smoke from their fires. On the following day, we went out to see the fields on the neighboring hillsides. There are cultivated places and unfarmed land. The soil is yellow and sandy. It is much inferior to the soil in Chekiang, and we could imagine what the harvest would be like. We walked through several villages, and as we saw their broken down, neglected condition, it was as if buckets of cold water were quenching the ardor which was in us. We began to worry how we would make a living in this kind of place. Would we be in the same pitiful condition as the natives after being here for a few years? The brothers and sisters would never be able to stand this kind of hardship....Our faith was so oppressed by the physical environment that it was difficult to stand firm. But in our deepest part, we felt that this kind of thought was from the enemy and that we should not allow it to have a place. A fierce struggle began in our hearts.</p><p>When I arose on the morning of the third day, I saw a copy of Streams in the Desert on the table. I picked it up and opened it to one page. The main point was that God is like a locomotive. He is fully able to move all His children, but they must have the hook of faith to connect them to the locomotive....After reading this, God grasped me again. I saw the light inwardly and was moved to confess my weakness and lack of faith before God and to ask Him for mercy. Thank the Lord, my inner boldness was immediately rekindled. I originally planned to return home dejectedly that day, but decided to stay for one more day. We then went to another place&mdash;Zhaobintian. The fields there are much better than those at Yangshuchiao. There is also a Christian in the denominations there (he is already in fellowship with us now) who warmly welcomed us. Praise the Lord that we did not go in vain that day. We felt that our mission had been accomplished.</p><p>We began our trip home the following day. We gathered the brothers and sisters who had signed up and told them everything that had happened. After listening, some became weak, while others became strong because they knew that this would be the way of suffering. At the same time God gave us a clear test because the landslides into the river had stopped within two weeks. Therefore, some became even weaker, but others became even stronger. We passed through three trials between the time everyone registered and the time we actually migrated. As a result, twenty-one households actually migrated, with a total of ninety-one people including children. (But we dare not say that all were those who had passed through trials.) The third step we took&mdash;since we have started counting the steps, the first step being the registration to migrate and the second step being the scouting out of the place&mdash;was to require all those migrating to fill out an announcement of their desire to migrate and to make a list of the possessions they were consecrating. They also had to first pass through consecration (the consecration of Romans 12). Based on their lists, we decided which ones would bear the responsibility for selling the possessions. About sixty to seventy percent of the possessions were sold within a month.</p><p>As the time to migrate came closer, things became more and more tense. The situation was pressing us to leave quickly. We did our best to consolidate our possessions on the one hand, and we asked the brothers to go to Xiaoshan to make arrangements for a train on the other hand, so that we would not have to make last-minute arrangements. The week before we left, we were busy packing our personal luggage and the things to take. When we finished packing, we gathered all the people and their belongings at the meeting hall (in Shi-Er-Dai) to wait for our departure. We also had a departure meeting for one day to serve as our spiritual food for the way. We left on the sixteenth day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar. In the morning everyone fasted and prayed, asking the Lord to give us the inward and outward strength we would need along the way and to lead us as we began to go in the way before us. Everyone's heart was filled with anxiety. Perhaps, we were like the Israelites as they left Egypt. After praying, we took a picture of those migrating. The brothers and sisters and their friends and relatives all crowded into the meeting hall to say good-by to each other. Everyone's heart was filled with a mixture of joy and sadness. We were sad to be leaving our friends and relatives and could not help but feel privately depressed. We were happy that we were doing God's will and were giving Him a way to go on. We believed that what we were giving up would become our reward in the future. As we thought of this, we became joyful again. We ate lunch early because we wanted to leave early. The church held a love feast for us to say good-by. Although the food was delicious, we had no heart to enjoy it. After lunch we went to the river's edge and boarded the boat. The banks on both sides of the river were filled with those sending us off. As we boarded the boat, we could not hold back the tears from our eyes. After we boarded the boat, I thanked those sending us off on behalf of the entire group and added a parting word of the gospel to those who had not yet believed in the Lord. After I finished speaking, the boat set sail, and a band began playing. We then said good-by to our hometown.</p>
