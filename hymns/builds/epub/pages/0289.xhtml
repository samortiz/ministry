<div class='line'><b>1</b> I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,</div>
<div class='line'>Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;</div>
<div class='line'>I tremble to know that for me He was crucified,</div>
<div class='line'>That for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled and died.</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>O it is wonderful that He should care for me</div>
<div class='line'>Enough to die for me!</div>
<div class='line'>O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> I marvel that He would descend from His throne divine</div>
<div class='line'>To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;</div>
<div class='line'>That He should extend His great love unto such as I,</div>
<div class='line'>Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> I think of His side, pierced and bleeding to pay the debt,</div>
<div class='line'>Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?</div>
<div class='line'>No, no! I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,</div>
<div class='line'>And testify all my desires He doth fully meet.</div>
