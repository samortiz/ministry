   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE RECOVERY AND ENLARGEMENT OF GOD'S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The six Old Testament books of 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, and 1 and 2 Chronicles reveal not only a history of the tabernacle with its ark, but also the recovery and enlargement of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have only seen the record of history, that is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From the history we must see God's way of recovery and enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The record is mostly on the negative side, while the recovery and the enlargement are positive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All history is for the purpose of the enlargement of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit the six books of history to which we have referred are put together as a set.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the very beginning there is a good prospect God's building has been established in a definite place called Shiloh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The people need wander no longer; from that time anyone desiring God had a definite place to which he could go.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How wonderful it is to have a definite place where we can meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE DEGRADATION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This pleasant situation, this glorious prospect, did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ark was captured, and God's building suffered severe degradation 1 Sam 3 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But even before the ark was captured, the situation within the tabernacle was full of gloom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There was no light; everything was in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was no fresh word, no fresh revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The priests had become old and out of date.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, God raised up a child: He was forced to bring forth something fresh and new.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must learn never to be old.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The degradation worsened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Israelites would not get right with God; instead, they became superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They used the ark to fight one of their battles; the ark was captured, and degradation reached its worst.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>GOD'S RECOVERY AND ENLARGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But although the ark was captured, God's recovery began at that very point.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must realize that God can never be defeated in His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's enemy may frustrate and delay Him for a time, but Satan can never frustrate God to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's purpose must be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once God plans something, He will inevitably accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to chapters 5 and 6 of 1 Samuel, it appears that the purpose of God has been overthrown: the ark was captured by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, all the enemy's activity and frustration only opens the way, not only for God's recovery, but also for God's enlargement!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When God recovers something, He always enlarges it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need glorious insight to understand all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Based upon the history of the degradation of God's people, some Christian teachers have taught that once the situation is degraded it can never be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, by reading the Scriptures over and over, we see just the contrary.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once the situation among God's people is degraded, God eventually and inevitably recovers and enlarges it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>During our early years in the Lord's service, we were somewhat influenced by the negative teaching of these Christian teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To some extent, we took the same view.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But later, by the Lord's enlightenment, we discovered just the opposite in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can we say that the things which have been degraded can never be recovered?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually there will be the New Jerusalem, which is far better than anything!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That will be much better, transcendently better than the situation at the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 1 Samuel, the beginning of this set of six books, there is a tabernacle, but in the last three books of this set there is a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The temple is a tremendous improvement over the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In fact, there is no comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the tabernacle there were altogether twenty-four pieces of precious stones, but they were all rather small.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The forty-eight boards, though they were overlaid with gold, were all thin and narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Both the stones and the boards were indeed precious, but they had little size or weight.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, the tabernacle had some sort of foundation, but there was no floor, for the tabernacle was erected in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now let us consider the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The precious stones used there were huge, incomparably larger that those in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the temple there was not a small amount of one kind of wood as in the tabernacle, but an abundance of three kinds of wood olive, fir or cypress and cedar of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even the ground floor in the temple was made of wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The length of the tabernacle was thirty cubits, but the length of the temple was sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The width of the tabernacle was ten cubits, but the width of the temple was twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the horizontal dimensions were doubled.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The tabernacle was ten cubits high, while the temple was thirty cubits high three times higher.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, the tabernacle was not only recovered in the temple, but also much enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some Bible teachers, as we have mentioned, do not see how things which are once degraded can ever be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They insist that all these things are dispensationally past and can never be regained.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But according to typology the picture is exceedingly clear that something which has been degraded can not only be recovered, but also enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Oh, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must have the faith to believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The church can be much better today than at the time of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God is moving on!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If God was One who could always be defeated, how could He reach His goal?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Regardless of how much degradation and confusion there is, God is marching on.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you have this glorious vision, you will never be discouraged or disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some Bible teachers are always bemoaning the fact of how far the church today is removed from its wonderful state at the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you are in this condition, you do not have adequate vision.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If your eyes have been opened to see the Lord's recovery, you will leap up and shout, "Hallelujah, regardless of the degradation and confusion, the Lord is marching on!"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is really glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>From 1939 to 1942 Brother Watchman Nee was helping us during a time of informal training in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One night, in a prayer meeting of the church, someone prayed like this: "O Lord, we are so pitiful!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The church is so weak and poor; there is nothing but disappointment!"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It sounded good and many responded with Amens.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But Brother Nee immediately interjected a prayer something like this: "Lord, Thy church can never be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In Thy eyes the church is strong, the church is beautiful."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>So many followed this prayer with, "Hallelujah, Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It was a great contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Everything depends upon our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord told Balaam, the Gentile prophet, "He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob; neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel" Num 23:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the eyes of the Lord, "How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, thy tabernacles, O Israel!"</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Num 24:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God always sees through the valleys to the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Of course, if you are in a valley, you may bemoan the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But that is not the end that is just an underpass on the highway to the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You must drive through the underpass to the goal upon the high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must learn to see through things to the goal, not only with insight, but also with foresight.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The church can never be defeated!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>You are wrong if you say the church is always defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The church will eventually be victorious!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We must see God's way in the recovery and enlargement of His building.</S>
