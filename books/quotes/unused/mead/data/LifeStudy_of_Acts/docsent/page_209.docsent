   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WITNESS OF THE THINGS IN WHICH WE SEE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 16 the Lord Jesus said to Paul, I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me, and the things in which I will appear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Notice that here the phrase in which is used twice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here Paul is saying that the Lord had appointed him a minister and a witness of the things He revealed to Paul and of the things He would reveal to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although this is Paul s meaning, this is not the way he presented the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, this verse speaks of the things in which Paul had seen the Lord and of the things in which the Lord would yet appear to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 26:16 indicates that Paul did not receive the revelation of things without seeing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, he received the things in which he saw Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, Christ did not reveal things to Paul without Himself as the content of those things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reason that Paul would be a witness of the things in which he had seen the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In all the visions Paul saw he saw Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, he would be a witness of the things in which the Lord was yet to appear to him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here the Lord seemed to be saying to Paul, In all the visions and revelations you will receive, I shall appear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that if we only see visions and revelations and do not see the Lord, then what we see is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not agree with studying the Bible merely in a theological way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who study the Bible in this way may learn theology, but they do not see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a great difference between studying the Bible to learn theology and studying the Bible in order to see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As Paul was on the way to Damascus, Christ revealed certain things to him, and in those things Paul saw Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord indicated that He would reveal more things to Paul, and in those things the Lord Himself would appear to him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, what Paul saw was not merely the things themselves, but Christ as the One appearing in all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In your experience you may claim to receive light from the Lord or to see a vision or revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, you need to consider if Christ has appeared to you in that light, vision, or revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the supposed light, vision, or revelation, have you seen Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes brothers have come to me excited about some supposed new light they have received.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, a brother once said, I praise the Lord that today during morning watch I saw some new light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I asked concerning the light he had seen, he replied, I have been enlightened to see that I should cut my hair short.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I asked him what the significance of such light was, and he said that cutting his hair short would make him more clean.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To this I replied, What is wrong with having your hair somewhat longer?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Nazarites in the Old Testament kept their hair long.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then at the conclusion of their vow, they shaved their heads, and in this way they were cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It seems that your way of cutting your hair is not as good as that of the Nazarites.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I spoke to the brother in this way concerning the light he claimed to receive from the Lord because the so-called light was without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In any light we receive of the Lord we must see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ must appear to us in whatever we see in the way of enlightenment, vision, or revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we see a vision without seeing Christ, that vision means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, if we study the Bible and gain knowledge of the Scriptures without seeing Christ, that knowledge is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all need to learn to see Christ in the things that are revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I appreciate the phrase in which that is used twice in 26:16.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord first spoke of the things in which you have seen Me. Then He went on to speak of the things in which I will appear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here the Lord was saying to Paul, I will not merely reveal certain things to you, but in the things revealed I Myself will appear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The book of Revelation is an excellent illustration of the Lord appearing in the things revealed to the apostle John.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John saw a number of visions, but in these visions the Lord Himself appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Consider the first vision in Revelation, the vision of the golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Concerning this vision, John says, I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and having turned I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man...</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rev 1:12-13a .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this vision of the lampstands John saw the Lord walking among the lampstands as the High Priest dressing the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In another vision the Lord showed John God s universal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Regarding this, John says, After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Immediately I was in spirit; and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and One sitting upon the throne Rev 4:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John went on to say that in this vision he saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth Rev 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once again, in the things that were revealed to John he saw the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In principle, our experience today should be the same as that of Paul and John.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose that in your study of the New Testament you claim to have some understanding of Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the crucial question is this: Do you see Christ in Ephesians 5?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you see only the matter of husbands loving their wives and wives submitting to their husbands but do not see Christ, then your understanding of Ephesians 5 is very poor, even vain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may know certain teachings in the Bible, but in those teachings you do not see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You may learn the doctrines of the Scriptures, but in those things Christ has not appeared to you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May we all learn the importance of seeing Christ in the things that we claim to see and know in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our consideration of the phrase in which in Acts 26:16 may be helpful in showing us the way to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In our reading of the Scriptures, we need to dwell on matters such as this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we spend time to consider the phrase in which used twice in 26:16, we shall realize how marvelous it was for the Lord to say to Paul that He had appointed him a minister and a witness both of the things in which he had seen the Lord and of the things in which the Lord would appear to him.</S>
