   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, we need to continually abide in Him, settle down in Him, and take Him as our abiding place.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The All-inclusive One</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>with the Unsearchable Riches</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ is the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ, as the infinite God, is without any limitation and is so great that He fills all things in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such an all-extensive and all-filling Christ has the unsearchable riches 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These riches are what Christ is to us, what He has for us, and what He has accomplished, attained, and obtained for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These riches of Christ are unsearchable and untraceable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As God, He is the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Lord, and the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As man, He is the Apostle, the Shepherd, the Forerunner, and the Captain of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are countless aspects of the riches of what Christ is, for He is the reality of all positive things in the universe, and all positive things signify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, when He was on earth, He could use so many things as illustrations of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He could say, "I am the door" John 10:9 and "I am the way" 14:6 .</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The unsearchable riches of Christ are all the fullness of the Godhead, spoken of in Colossians 2:9, which fullness now dwells bodily in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead, but the expression of the riches of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, all the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in Him as One who has a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the divine attributes and human virtues are included in the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is love, light, holiness, righteousness, wisdom, and power; He is also humility, patience, sincerity, and goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Old Testament, the good land of Canaan, which God gave to the children of Israel, is a complete type of Christ as the all-inclusive One Deut 8:7-10; 11:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The produce of the good land portrays the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
