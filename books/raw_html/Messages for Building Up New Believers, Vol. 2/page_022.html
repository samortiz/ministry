<h1 class="title">IF ANYONE SINS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 5:14; 8:11; Rom. 6:1-2; Num. 19:1-10, 12-13, 17-19; 1 John 1:7&mdash;2:2</h1>
<p>After we are saved, we should <em>sin no more.</em> John 5 records the incident of the Lord Jesus healing one who had been sick for thirty-eight years near the pool in Bethesda. After the man was healed the Lord met him in the temple and said to him, &ldquo;Behold, you have become well; <em>sin no more</em> so that nothing worse happens to you&rdquo; (v. 14). John 8 speaks of the Lord Jesus forgiving a woman who had committed adultery. He said to her then and there, &ldquo;From now on <em>sin no more</em>&rdquo; (v. 11). Once we are saved, we are charged by the Lord to <em>sin no more!</em> As saved ones, <em>we surely should not continue in sin.</em></p>
<h2 class="head1">I. SINNING AFTER BEING SAVED</h2>
<p>Since a Christian should not sin and should not continue in sins, is it then possible for a Christian not to sin? The answer is yes! It is possible for Christians not to sin because we have God&rsquo;s life within us. This life does not sin. It cannot tolerate any trace of sin. This life is as holy as God is holy. The life within us makes us very sensitive to sin. If we walk according to the sense of this life and if we live by this life, we will not sin.</p>
<p>However, it is possible for Christians to sin. We are still in the flesh. If we do not walk according to the Spirit and live in life, we can sin at any time. Galatians 6:1 says, &ldquo;Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense...&rdquo; First John 2:1 says, &ldquo;My little children...if anyone sins...&rdquo; It is possible for Christians to be overtaken by sins. There is still the possibility of sinning. First John 1:8 says, &ldquo;If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves.&rdquo; Verse 10 says, &ldquo;If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar.&rdquo; Hence, our experience shows us that it is possible for Christians to fall <em>accidentally</em> into sin.</p>
<p>Will a saved person who has fallen accidentally into sin still perish? No! The Lord said, &ldquo;And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand&rdquo; (John 10:28). In other words, once a person is saved, he is saved forever. &ldquo;They shall by no means perish forever.&rdquo; Nothing can be surer than this! First Corinthians 5 speaks of a brother who had committed fornication. Paul said, &ldquo;To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord&rdquo; (v. 5). Even though the flesh of a believer who sins may be destroyed, his spirit will still be saved.</p>
<p>Does this therefore mean that after a person is saved, it does not matter whether he sins? No! If a person sins after he is saved, there will be two terrible consequences. First, he will suffer in this life. If you sin after you are saved, you will suffer the consequence of your sin. The person in 1 Corinthians 5 was delivered to Satan. This is a great suffering. After a person has repented and confessed to the Lord, God will forgive him and the blood will cleanse him. With some sins, however, there are further consequences that one must face. Although Jehovah removed David&rsquo;s sin of taking Uriah&rsquo;s wife, the sword never departed from his house forever (2 Sam. 12:9-13). Brothers and sisters, sin is like a venomous serpent; it is not an amusing plaything. If you are bitten by it, you will suffer.</p>
<p>Second, if a man sins he will be punished in the coming age. If a Christian sins and does not deal with it properly in this age, he will have to deal with it in the coming age. When the Lord comes again, &ldquo;He will repay each man according to his doings&rdquo; (Matt. 16:27). Paul said, &ldquo;For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:10).</p>
<p>Besides these two terrible consequences, there is another immediate result of sin&mdash;the breaking down of fellowship with God. To a Christian, fellowship with God is a most glorious privilege. Such fellowship is the greatest blessing he can have. However, if he sins, he will immediately lose his fellowship with God. The Holy Spirit within him will grieve for him, and the life in him will feel uncomfortable about his sin. He will lose his joy as well as his fellowship with God. Formerly, when he saw God&rsquo;s children, he was warmly attracted to them, but now he no longer feels that warmth; there seems to be a barrier between him and them. Formerly, prayer and Bible reading were sweet. But now they have lost their sweetness; he can no longer touch God. Formerly, he treasured the church meetings very much; when he missed one meeting, he felt that he had suffered a great loss. But now the meetings are tasteless to him; it no longer makes a difference whether or not he goes. When he sees God&rsquo;s children, he wants to run away instead of meeting them. Everything has changed.</p>
<p>It is a serious thing for a person to sin after he is saved! We must never be loose in our conduct. We must never tolerate sin and must never give ground to it.</p>
<p>But what do we do &ldquo;if anyone sins&rdquo;? If a Christian becomes careless and sins by mistake, if he is overtaken by sins, what should he do? How can he come back to the Lord? How can he recover his fellowship with God? This is a very important subject, and we have to study it carefully.</p>
