[1]  Being Up-to-Date for the Rebuilding of the Temple CONTENTS
[2]  AND THE PROSPECTS OF THE NEW SYSTEM Scripture Reading: Psa 52:8; Luke 2:25-32, 36-38 RECEIVING THE ETERNAL LIFE,
[3]  If we are destined to live until we are ninety years old, then for every year that passes, we must subtract a year from our life, and for every ten years that pass, we must subtract ten years from our life.
[4]  In his two short words, the word says that the Lord Jesus was the consolation of God s people, and the other says that the Lord Jesus was God s salvation vv.
[5]  If we are filled with them, we will have nothing to say when we come to the meeting.
[6]  Even in the Lord s table meeting when we are remembering the Lord, we are still thinking about our children.
[7]  The change in system requires us to dream of Christ, receive a revelation of Christ, and be touched by Christ so that once we open our mouths, we will speak Christ.
[8]  When we go to work, we should be think about Christ, and when we go home to do our laundry and cooking, we should still be thinking about Christ.
[9]  PAYING ATTENTION TO THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS AND SPEAKING THE LORD S WORD IN THE MEETINGS
[10]  We have a kind of slogan that says, Heaven may fade, and earth may flee, but small group meetings must never be missed.
[11]  TO OVERCOME THE EVIL ONE THE THREE GROUPS OF PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH
[12]  The elderly saints among us are full of vigor and vitality, the working saints among us are like brave lions, and the young ones among us are lively and full of strength.
[13]  To be for the Lord does not mean that we merely obey the will of God but that we do the will of God.
[14]  When God s love operates in us, we also love and desire God s word.
[15]  Romans 12 says, And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect v. 2 . Strictly speaking, the will of God is that we who are saved, who love Him, and who follow Him, would live a normal church life.
[16]  Today if what we are doing is not related to this, we are not doing the will of God.
[17]  Matthew 6:31-32 says, Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?
[18]  However, the Lord Jesus said, I say to you, Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on v. 25 . This is the Lord s command, the Lord s charge.
[19]  If we seek God s kingdom but are detached from the church and do not live the church life, then we are not truly seeking God s kingdom.
[20]  Romans 12:1-2 says, I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service.
[21]  However, we who love the Lord, in the midst of our busy lives, must present our bodies to the Lord and place ourselves in the church life.
[22]  When the day of our group meeting comes, we have to pray to the Lord throughout the day, O Lord, today I have to speak for You in the small group meeting.
[23]  Verse 26 says that if we do not hate our own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and even our own soul-life, we cannot be the Lord s disciples.
[24]  Even if we already hated people, we would not be able to hate to the degree that we would hate our own relatives, including our parents, our children, our wife, and our brothers and sisters.
[25]  It seems that there is no way for us to follow the Lord, because if we want to follow Him, we have to hate all the people, things, and matters that are related to us.
[26]  However, we are children of God, and we belong to God.
[27]  There are two things that enable us to overcome all these temptations: one is the inward life that has been granted to us by God s divine power, and the other is the outward promise that as long as we fulfill our duty, God will add to us whatever we need.
[28]  The saints who are doctors should not labor for more money.
[29]  They only know to trust in the Lord, live to the Lord, live Christ, preach the gospel, and live the church life, and the Lord truly adds to them all that they need.
[30]  Hence, society today needs people like us who not only honor God but also, through the gospel, eliminate the corruption and darkness in society so that our society and nation would benefit.
[31]  Therefore, we should clearly see before the Lord that we are a different group of people.
[32]  Although we might have fallen into a lukewarm condition because of the environment and all kinds of distressing experiences, we are willing to rise up again to put our Christian life in order and to live a life that follows the Lord according to His word.
[33]  CHAPTER FIVE KNOWING THE PRESENT AGE Scripture Reading: John 7:38-39; Acts 1:8; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:20-21; Rev 19:10; 22:2 BEING ONE WHO KNOWS THE AGE
[34]  If we truly know the Bible, we will be able to see what kind of age we are in according to the prophecies in the Bible and the world situation today.
[35]  We all love the Lord and are willing to change the system to evangelize Taiwan, but we need to be clear concerning the entire world situation and the situation of the churches so that we know where we are.
[36]  The way of meeting in the old system was to gather one hundred to three hundred people in a meeting hall every Lord s Day to have a meeting where one person spoke and everyone else listened.
[37]  This way was practiced for nearly forty years and was very effective during the first five or six years, because at that time we also had small group meetings.
[38]  THE LIVING OF THE NEW WAY Having Morning Revival
[39]  The first thing we should do in our living is to get up early in the morning to call, O Lord Jesus and to enjoy two verses.
[40]  Because we live on the earth and have received the Lord s salvation, we should be a testimony for the Lord.
[41]  Since we love the Lord, experience that He is true and living, and know that one day He will come back and that we will see Him, we should live Him in our lives and live out a genuine testimony of Him.
[42]  Thus, not only should we preach the gospel by door-knocking, we should also live out a testimony before our neighbors in our family life, in our comings and goings, in our speaking and attitude, and in our clothing, attire, and adornment.
[43]  The saints who are teachers are all burning in spirit after three days of training and feel that their attendance at the training has been very beneficial.
[44]  OF THE CHURCH MEETINGS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:15-16 THE SUCCESS OF THE EXPERIMENT OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL THROUGH DOOR-KNOCKING
[45]  As we began to change the system, we came back to the Bible and studied and researched the way to meet as it was in the beginning.
[46]  Today many of us elderly saints have the same feeling as those in Ezra We feel that it is truly a blessing to see the Lord rebuilding His temple in His recovery.
[47]  However, some time ago I began to have some regrets inwardly that when we started the work in Taiwan in 1949 we did not insist on abolishing the Lord s Day message meeting and did not insist on carrying out what Brother Nee had seen in The Normal Christian Church Life.
[48]  The New Testament tells us that as saved ones we have been regenerated in our spirit and that from the time we were saved, God has been edifying and building up our spirit.
[49]  Hence, to build up our spirit, the individual spirit, is to build up God s dwelling place, God s temple.
[50]  It is through all the saved ones encouraging one another and functioning in mutuality according to their fellowship with the Lord and the experiences of life they have had with the Lord in their spirit.
[51]  Brother Nee even said in a message that we should tell the newly saved ones that when they attend the Lord s Day meeting, they are not coming to a meeting of the church but to a meeting of the work.
[52]  Earlier we mentioned that Brother Nee spoke some words concerning the Lord s Day meeting in The Normal Christian Church Life and Church Affairs, but we never emphasized them in our speaking to the saints.
[53]  FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST
[54]  We all have had this kind of experience the more we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the more we speak, and the more we speak, the more we are filled with the Holy Spirit.
[55]  Although the light among us is very strong, and we receive much speaking, when we look at the condition of our meetings, we cannot see much of the reality of the Body of Christ.
[56]  However, even though the Lord has blessed us like this, we still keep one thing that is not blessed by the Lord, that is, our Lord s Day meeting in which one person speaks and everyone else listens.
[57]  Today we need to apologize to the elderly saints that in our service to the church we have not followed the light that Brother Nee saw several decades ago regarding changing the Lord s Day message meeting.
[58]  But now after a few years of training and many experiments, we have found that we have a new way to meet, not only for our Lord s Day meeting but even for our other regular meetings.
[59]  CHAPTER NINE THE CENTRAL PURPOSE OF GOD S ECONOMY REGARDING THE MEETINGS
[60]  The Lord has led us to the focus of the new way and the central point of our change in system, that is, the central purpose of God s economy regarding the meetings of the believers.
[61]  Verses 10 through 11 say that after His ascension Christ received gifts from God and gave them to the church And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ vv.
[62]  A meeting in which one person speaks and everyone else listens is a big relief to all of us because it does not matter whether we quarrel at home every day.
[63]  As long as we bring our Bible bag to the meeting on the Lord s Day, our conscience will be all right because we do not need to speak.
[64]  Whether we failed or overcame during the week, we will feel fine as long as we go to the meeting, because in it just one person speaks and everyone else listens.
[65]  However, a meeting in which everyone speaks requires us to live an overcoming life, to fellowship with the Lord, to walk according to the spirit, to be burning in spirit, to call O Lord Jesus all the time, and to speak about Jesus to people every day.
[66]  I can testify that one who calls O Lord Jesus from morning to evening, who walks in the spirit and according to the Spirit, who is burning in spirit, and who speaks Jesus to people will surely look forward to the meeting with anticipation, because once he comes to the meeting, he will be able to share his experience with other saints and fellowship about it.
[67]  In October 1984 we mentioned the matter of changing the system and taking the new way in Taipei, but we did not change the system immediately because we still had to study the practical steps of the new way.
[68]  THE FAILURE IN THREE MATTERS IN THE PAST The Failure in the Preaching of the Gospel
[69]  In the former way, the old way, we completely failed in three matters.
[70]  The churches in the Lord s recovery are not the only ones who have failed in this matter.
[71]  Here it says that each one has, showing that according to the Bible, church meetings should not be meetings in which one person speaks and everyone else listens but meetings in which everyone speaks for the Lord.
[72]  If I had not been willing to receive the burden to start the work in America because I was afraid of changing my accent and method, the Lord s recovery would have been limited to the Far East among the Chinese-speaking ones, and the Lord s recovery would not have reached America, Africa, Europe, and Australia.
[73]  THE GOAL OF ADVANCING IN THE CHURCHES Establishing a Habit of Preaching the Gospel
[74]  Regarding establishing a habit of preaching the gospel, we are not saying that every saint has to go door-knocking.
[75]  This is the same with door-knocking we must compel people to come in. If we do not have a spirit to compel people, we cannot go door-knocking.
[76]  I hope that the churches in the Lord s recovery will take the way that has been ordained by the Lord the way of everyone preaching the gospel by door-knocking and everyone speaking for the Lord.
[77]  If we all build up the habit to contact the Lord and His word once we get up in the morning, and to live in the spirit, walk according to the spirit, be burning in spirit, and live Christ throughout the day, then when we come to the meeting, we all will have something to say.
[78]  In the meetings we not only can share the enlightenment and supply that we have received from the Lord s word, but we can also pray-read the hymns using our spirit.
[79]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE GOAL OF THE CHANGE IN SYSTEM AND FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE CAMPUS WORK
[80]  We all know that a student s purpose in studying medicine is to be a doctor, and a student s purpose in studying agriculture is to research farming techniques.
[81]  If we want to supply people through our speaking, we must be exercised in three matters.
[82]  First, we must live in the spirit every moment; second, we must learn to fellowship with the Lord and experience the Lord; and third, we must enjoy the Lord and His word every day.
[83]  Even though we may bring people to love the Lord, if we do not have the kind of meeting that is according to the Scriptures, we still will have no way to build up the Body of Christ.
[84]  Question: We feel that we are not skillful enough in the matter of service.
[85]  The reason that our gospel is not strong is that we do not have the kind of living that we mentioned earlier as our base.
[86]  In the meetings we still may not know when we should open our mouths and when we should not, but this does not matter.
[87]  We also would like to fellowship with all the saints about the Lord s work and leading among us in various aspects during these three years so that the saints will know what the Lord has done in our midst.
[88]  At the beginning when we changed the system, we were very clear that we had never walked on this new way and did not have enough experience, but we still tried to take this way.
[89]  We received the burden from the Lord that from the second half of 1984 the Lord s recovery had to change its appearance and not continue in its past condition, because our way of meeting and much of our past condition was not according to the Bible.
[90]  Many who know all the processes and situations that we go through to get things done in the training have said that it is marvelous that over six hundred Americans have come to Taiwan to coordinate with over three thousand saints here in Taipei in such harmony.
[91]  In short, there are over five thousand saints who meet in the meeting halls, over five thousand new ones who are under our care in the communities, and two thousand two hundred saints who have been recently recovered.
[92]  Besides these, we gained one thousand seven hundred to one thousand eight hundred people through our door-knocking during the feast.
[93]  This means that we need to take care of fourteen thousand people, of which ten thousand need to be worked on, brought to the district meetings, and fostered to live a complete and proper church life with all the saints.
[94]  This preparation began a month and a half ago when we were helping the elderly saints, telling them that they should call O Lord Jesus every morning when they get up and then pray-read two verses to enjoy the Lord.
[95]  If a person lives in this way throughout the day, he will surely have a desire to meet, and in the meetings he will be living, he will experience the Lord and have the Lord s presence, and he will spontaneously be full of words to speak without needing any specific preparation.
[96]  Brother Nee once said that if someone regularly attends meetings in which one person speaks and everyone else listens, over a period of time this way of meeting will become a habit to him and will be hard to change.
[97]  On the contrary, we also have had the experience that when we did open our mouths in a meeting, although the meeting may have been poor, we still felt that it was a good meeting.
[98]  In the past we may have come to the kind of meeting in which one person spoke and everyone else listened, and it did not matter whether we had been overcoming or not because we were not required to speak.
[99]  However, we know that because of the actual situations, human conditions, and the age and physical health of the saints, not all of them can go door-knocking.
[100]  If some try to persuade us not to speak about this, we still must speak about it because this is the burden that we have received from the Lord, and we must be accountable to the Lord.
[101]  If we are those who live in the Lord, we surely will be able to speak when we have to speak, sing when we have to sing, and read when we have to read.
[102]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN KNOWING GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Eph 3:8-10
[103]  The deepest verses in the entire Bible are Ephesians 3:8-10, which say, To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel and to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.
[104]  Although this was our condition, because of God s great love with which He loved us, He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to accomplish redemption for us.
[105]  Today as long we repent, believe in Him, and receive Him as our Savior, we will be saved and regenerated, we will have the living God as our life, and we will have light, joy, and peace.
[106]  God s eternal economy is to gain a group of people that He may dispense Himself into them to be their life and everything so that they may be joined to Him as one, be filled and occupied with Him, and be one entity with Him on the earth to be the Body of Christ, the church, for His expression.
[107]  But if he hears the gospel, believes that Jesus Christ is God who became a man, died for him on the cross, was resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit, and also confesses with his mouth and calls on the Lord from deep within, saying, O Lord Jesus, at that very moment, the Lord as the life-giving Spirit will enter into his spirit to enliven and regenerate him.
[108]  We will be able to speak not only to the Chinese here but also to the people in other countries of the world, and we will not speak the superficial and low gospel, but we will be able to speak God s economy, which is mysterious and high.
[109]  I hope that we all will be able to read the Bible properly, know God s economy completely, know the economy of the mystery of God, pursue the unsearchable riches of Christ, and at the same time, enter into the church, which is produced by these riches for the expression of the multifarious wisdom of God.
[110]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN FELLOWSHIP WITH THE ELDERLY SAINTS CONCERNING THE BURDEN OF THE NEW WAY
[111]  When we spend more time on the young people, this can easily create a situation in the church life in which people may think that we do not pay attention to the elderly ones.
[112]  If there are not that many elderly saints in a church, that church will surely give people a feeling that there is a lack, but if there is an adequate number of elderly saints in a church, people will feel that that church is weighty.
[113]  If we quarrel with our family and throw our chopsticks during dinner, when we come to the meeting, not only will we be unable to say anything, but we will not even be able to call O Lord.
[114]  If we are touched in our conscience that we have offended someone, we should confess it to the Lord immediately, and we should also confess it to the one whom we offended and make reconciliation with him.
[115]  Some people have asked why we should preach the gospel through door-knocking and where the Bible mentions door-knocking.
[116]  If there were no sons of peace in a house, the peace would return upon them v. 6 . He also told these ones that no matter which house they entered, they should remain in that house v. 7 . From this we can see that the Lord not only visited people but also even remained with them.
[117]  According to our observation, the first function of the elderly saints is that they must follow in their spirit.
[118]  If the elderly saints coordinate with the young people and occasionally go out with them, not every day but maybe once a week, accompanying the young people to visit the new ones in their homes, when the new ones raise questions related to human life, the elderly saints will be able to render help to them simply by speaking three to five sentences.
[119]  In the church if the elderly saints coordinate with the younger saints and completely blend with them as one, this will give people a very good impression and will cause them to respect us, envy us, and sense that God is truly in our midst.
[120]  Now what we need are an enduring character and a long-term endeavor that are unshakable to the end. By the Lord s grace, we need to practice before God every day, saying, O Lord, I love You.
